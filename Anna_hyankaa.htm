This is the roster of characters so far for my Neopets fiction. It is *supposedly* in the order that these characters appear, but I do not guarantee that.

<h2>Main Characters</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Keemiter</h3>
<div id="card" style="height: 270px;">
<div id="info">
<b>Name:</b> Prince Keemiter of Hathidesa
<br><b>Age:</b> 18 years old
<br><b>Land of Origin:</b> Shenkuu
<br><b>Family:</b> The Raja and (late) Rani of Hathidesa
<br><b>Friends:</b> 
<br><b>Enemies:</b> Colorful
<br><b>Story:</b>
<p>
A young prince of a small mountain nation underneath the vast empire of Shenkuu, Keemiter once lived a peaceful, pompous life, until the fateful day when a monster came to his nation, ravaged his city, wrecked havoc in his family's palace and committed the ultimate sin. Ever since, he has sworn to take revenge on this Kougra who came by, and left his kingdom to train and track the wretched shadow witch down. He has been following along the path of destruction she has been leaving behind for months now, which has been leading him down the tenebrous Haunted Woods, an evil forest he has only heard of in stories before. Where and how will this quest end? He doesn't know, all that he knows is that it is too late to turn back now, and return to the life he once had.

<div id="info" style="padding-left: 10px; width: 520px;">
<b>Name:</b> Lady Roxanna Adrasteia Kekethos of Altador
<br><b>Age:</b> 19 years old
<br><b>Land of Origin:</b> Altador
<br><b>Family:</b> The late Lord Adrastos and Lady Chloria Kekethos
<br><b>Friends:</b> The late Faerie Boria
<br><b>Enemies:</b> Keemiter
<br><b>Story:</b>
<p>
This young witch was once the single child of an infamous Altadorian patrician family, notorious for having sided with the Darkest Faerie back on the day, and, despite its head having asked for forgiveness of King Altador himself, had become a social outcast in Altadorian society. So it was no wonder that her disappearances, and later on the family's and their house's demise went on unnoticed for months on end. As a matter of fact, it was assumed she had too perished in the fire that burned on the countryside house, until, that is, reports of a strange creature with shadow powers similar to her father's, but far more dangerous and uncontrolled and powerful, started showing up in other places, including on a small Eastern province of the Shenkuuvian Empire where a small country of Elephantes exists. Other rumors also went around previously, of a similar creature ravaging a small village North of the Haunted Woods, at the foot of the mid-continent mountain range, where an outcast Dark Faerie lived. But a more recent reporting places her and her shadow projections somewhere in the depths of the vast Haunted Woods, seeking helpless victims, and heading towards Neovia, unfortunately.

<br><b>Story:</b>
<p>
Originally a failed experiment from Sloth's laboratories, this Grundo has been brought up on the ships of his fleet, and has long done maintenance and other grunt work and low level missions. After a mishap in one of the first missions she was given the lead, she had been demoted out of missions altogether... That is, until Dr. Zakaraiah had an idea for his invention.

<br><b>Enemies:</b> 
<br><b>Story:</b>
<p>
A prototype robot of a new kind, created by Dr. Zakaraiah, one of Dr. Sloth's leading scientists, meant for higher types of stealth missions. And yet, this is not your run-of-the-mill robot, being equipped with impeccable fighting abilities, an outer shell that can simulate other Neopets, with varying degrees of success at passing, and, finally, a self-learning AI. Now, all that is needed is that the robot learns how to socially mingle in perfectly, and you'll have the perfect spy and/or assassin type.

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Depequi</h3>
<div id="card" style="height: 250px;">

<b>Name:</b> Depequi
<br><b>Age:</b> ???
<br><b>Land of Origin:</b> Kreludor
<br><b>Family:</b> 
<br><b>Friends:</b> Belletye
<br><b>Enemies:</b> 
<br><b>Story:</b>
<p>
A spark of primordial Neopian magic that came to life, Depequi doesn't usually take a form unless she wants to interact. The issue is, she is far too strange and powerful for anyone to come near, as she doesn't realize she literally radiates so much magic she can hurt mainly those not used to it. She is usually found wandering in the Neopian outer space or exploring Kreludor's dark side, where she seems to have caught a trail of something going on. One time she met this funny little Grundo with wings named Belletye, who was lost in the lunar desert, and she led this Grundo back after some talk, as she noticed that the Grundo wasn't seeming all that well.

<br><b>Enemies:</b> 
<br><b>Story:</b>
<p>
A travelling merchant of specific wares, Penguin grew up on the streets of Moltara as an orphan, and was taken under the wings of the local chapter of the Thieves' Guild. He proved himself to be intelligent and very adept at creating explosives and other powder-fueled weapons, of which he made his business, and, as soon as Moltara became open to the greater Neopia, he set off to travel the world. Using the different locations of his Guild as stopping points, he has been travelling all over, and working as he goes, meeting new Neopians and sharing his stories and also listening in. In Neopia Central, he even met a young Buzz who was more than insistent on trying to keep him here, and get him involved with her father's business, which he has been pondering heavily about. But there are also others he befriended he'd miss if he settled for one land, like a family in the outer areas of Neovia whose head treats him like part of them. Also, he would miss all the strange sights a Moltaran like him had seen over the years. But him and the Buzz at least have engaged already, and they will figure out something eventually.

<br><b>Story:</b>
<p>
A Neovian orphan whose parents' house caught fire in a suspicious incident when he was very young, after accusations and gossips spread around of the nature of his parents' business and of their own nature, Noah was fortunate to have found a new home with the Jones, a family that owns an inn in the southern part of town. He was raised along with Mrs. Jones's two children, a pair of Kyriis by the name of Lucas and Mariah, and they grew up as tight as a trio. The three get into all sorts of trouble, with the bluecaps included, as they and the others of the group of outcast children do all sorts of shenanigans, from vandalism to petty thievery. But, as of recently, the tone has shifted with their group of friends, and what was once causing havoc just for fun is shifting into something else, led by the head of their group, a Moehog named Billy Blake, and his aspirations.

<br><b>Story:</b>
<p>
The youngest of the children of Martha Jones, she's a plucky little pink Kyrii with a penchant for running her mouth, and whose creepy interests include collecting bug exoskeletons for collages and getting her hands on clown and puppet dolls for her own use. She's quite prodigious with magic, only it is of the dark variety, and it is told that she is the result of her mother's affair with a demon that came from and returned to the depths of the Haunted Woods. Despite being the youngest of the trio under the care of the Innskeeper, she somehow finds herself stressing the most about the welfare of her half-brother Lucas and adoptive brother Noah, so she goes along with their plots to ensure their welfare... But that doesn't mean she does not enjoy partaking in some little rule-breaking and jewel-thieving from time to time.

<br><b>Story:</b>
<p>
He is the oldest of the trio, and half-brother to Mariah, and quite frankly the most irresponsible and irascible of them. If he has an idea in his mind, or if he wants something, he will follow through no matter the cost, no matter how chaotic or crazy the idea is, and attempts to stop him will only make him act out more... And that is how he has already earned a rep with the Neovian police for petty thievery and vandalism, besides other crimes. Also, because of that, he spends most of his time under some punishment either from his mother, the school authorities, or both. Noah and Mariah follow him along in his impulses, both to enjoy in the shenanigans, and to drag him out if things go too south, but the terrible trio have a reputation for being far from law-abiding. Apart his siblings, he doesn't have many friends, that is, besides Billy Blake's gang of outcast children, and he is fiercely loyal to the bunch.

<br><b>Story:</b>
<p>
An ice Acara who grew up her entire life on the plains the foot of the mountain range of Terror Mountain, Haute doesn't know much beyond her mother's cabin, the surrounding wilderness and forests, and the far away village of Happy Valley she visited a couple of times on a trip with her mother. They also barely get any visitors on account of their distance from any civilization, and only a random straggler, once in a blue moon, will find themselves lost at her mother's door, although they don't stay for too long. Haute is also a very powerful ice magician despite her age, and her mother chides her often for messing around with her powers and the consequences that they could bring, but there is not much else one can play around with being so far out there.

A mysterious ice Neopet who has been in Terror Mountain for centuries, she used to be part of a small tribe of specific ice Neopets that lived within the depths of the woods, but due to mishappenings she was involved with, got banned from ever returning there. Ever since, she has been living in the plains at the foot of the mountain range of Terror Mountain, mostly isolated from the rest of Neopia. As of recent years, it was rumored that she had a child now, but, for reasons undiscussed, it is also rumored that's no child of hers either.

A mysterious yet shady Faerie that nobody knew existed until very recently, she claims to be Mira's long lost sister, but... Is that correct? She seems to be investigating strange occurrences that started happening recently, but yet, she doesn't seem to like sharing what is she investigating about, getting agitated about it, mumbling about seeing this all happen before, rambling about some Princess and a Guardian...

<br><b>Story:</b>
<p>
A grumpy ghost who speaks in a near whisper, and isn't friendly nor approachable at all, having a fame for attacking anyone who approaches his swamp at the north of the town of Neovia with his ghastly powers over water and foliage alike... That is, until the Ghoul Catchers were called and caught him, and he was given the deal to either shape up and join the Defenders of Neopia, or get canned. Begrudgingly, he took the deal, and after some time training in Neopia Central he returned to the Haunted Woods, feeling more detached than before, and being pulled thin by all the occurrences that happen all over town and beyond, into the forest. His only friends are two other undead who have persisted being around him despite his prickly personality, Alice the (secret) vampire and Marcos the zombie, who also have been volunteering to help along with the specific cases regarding a recent increase in disappearances from townspets and others, and strange rumors of stranger creatures in the Woods.

A very, very old tale from before the Haunted Woods was as dark and spooky as it is nowadays tells of unfortunate brides given to a terrible noblepet as tributes from families that had nothing else to give, despite the common knowledge that those who went up to his castle never returned ever again... And yet somehow, a young Aisha not only managed to survive, but outlive said noblepet, and, by marriage rights inherit the lands and title. Centuries later, and a sole heir to this family stands, a young Aisha who recently sold her land and castle to go live a cushy life in the town of Neovia. On one hand she is an avid socialite and philanthropist, concerned with both the Neopets and the state of the town, and always ready to jump into action to help with anything she can... But on the other hand, she is still seen as strange and foreign and distant, and who hangs out with questionable companies, such as the two undead she is friends with. If there was a Neopian equivalent to a treasure trove of rumors, that would be her!

A zombie who one day emerged from the rotting soil of the depths of the Haunted Woods with newfound life, he doesn't remember anything from before, and it took him a long while to learn to communicate and move around properly. No, he doesn't notice the arrow going through his skull, or his skin's rotting condition, as a matter of fact, he doesn't feel much. Thankfully, Alice, who first noticed him back when she still lived in her old castle, took him in to care for him, and later on, when she moved into Neovia, he went along, even though none of the townies really like his presence. Also, he was the first of the two to contact Kunbao, as he one day just wandered into the Moonlight Swamp and didn't really care much about the ghost's threats and follow up attacks, and after all of that failed, there was only the option for the two to talk.

A strange, uncanny Darigan Kau who appeared out of the blue one day at Efrosinea's cabin to coerce her to coming along with him for whatever reasons involving whoever he serves. He dons a dark wide-brimmed hat that barely hides his terrible shining yellow eyes, and clothes like night from neck to hoof, including leather gloves and a long, black overcoat. His terrible singing seems to hypnotize those who listen to him, making them to do whatever he so pleases, and even driving them into madness if he so wishes. He has a posse of followers, both of the normal variety and of the yellow-eyed as well, but the way they move, and with how little they respond to anyone else but him, it just makes you wonder...

Despite frosty relations with the empire that subjugated his kingdom centuries ago, the Raja still sent a begging request to the Shenkuuvian Emperor to find his son and return the young Elephante home, and the Emperor in his turn forwarded to the other surrounding lands the concern, and yet, despite all of the efforts, it has been over two years since anyone has last heard of the prince.

Many said her gifts helped bring forth the prosperity and peace the kingdom was seeing in the upcoming years, and many travelled to Hathidesa's capital just to visit the royal family and witness this magically gifted Elephante. Then, one fateful day, the kingdom's capital was stormed by a monstrous witch, wrecking havoc in her path that led her directly to the palace, and it is said that in her last confrontation the Rani sacrificed herself trying to stop this witch, and in a certain way, the witch was stopped, as she fled the country afterwards, but not without leaving one too many victims in her wake.

Jasmine has just recently graduated in Art and Design, but recently has been requested by her father to work in his company, which she suspects it is to perhaps get her used to the idea of succeeding him in his place, but she has different plans for herself, aiming to get herself out there as a fashion designer. But that doesn't mean she won't do her part in her father's business half-heartedly, seeking talent and personnel that she hopes could be of good use. Her heart is set for this peculiar travelling Neopet she could not let go, a Moltaran magma Bruce by the name of Penguin who she wished he could just stay in Neopia Central, perhaps even get a job with her father, instead of risking himself out there in his travels. She longs and fears for his letters telling of his latest venture in one of the many lands of Neopia and his accounts of happenings and Neopets he comes across.

But bad reputation and problems kept on racking up in the financial costs, and it seemed like Mrs. Jones had no hopes of keeping the South Woods Country Inn open, to many Neovians' secret cheer...

Now, for what price? Who knows... Not only her Inn was saved, and her public seemed to shift more towards the odd and monstrous kind, but, to spook the more respectable town residents even further, the widow's family grew with one more child not much later.

Neopians thinks he's off his kilter given his strange behavior and stranger outfits and so many avoid him actively, and yet, his strangeness has attracted a few who befriended him out of curiosity and, sometimes, even solidarity. Particularly, an oddly average Kacheek who only goes by the name of Timmy, the young Neopian socialite Jasmine Eriscourt, a group of Virtupets ex-pats, in between others, who all come to visit and help the elder Poogle with his endeavors, and cheer on his experiments.

Some say that a place has a feel to it, like it has a beating heart, or, how some say, it's like the land has its own spirit... A spirit that can sometimes take a much more tangible and talkable shape, and wander among those who inhabit said place. He doesn't remember when did he first realize he had come to being, but Timmy has been wandering among Neopia Central's residents for a long time, a conceptual Neopet made reality by the mysterious means of Neopian magic, and yet completely mundane and perfectly average like the vast majority of the land's citizens. He had to choose his own name, as addressing one another by a name is of importance, and taking one's time to explain the convoluted yet vague existence one is as a physical manifestation of a land is far more complicated and stressful than just having a normal name, and yet, he has no purpose beyond that of being said manifestation. A stranger in his own land, he solely exists until it ceases to be a thing, a thought that never brought him much comfort, alongside his aimlessness on how to carry his own existence until this inevitable. His refuge is found in befriending others, and yet, as warned by others of similar existence, it can be a futile and heartbreaking experience, given how the existence of a land can long outlast the existence of a normal Neopet, but yet, that doesn't deter him from approaching his residents from time to time, in attempts to connect with them.

He even had been alerted to keep an eye out for two young Neopets at large, the Hathidesan prince, as well as this Altadorian witch, in hopes of catching them and sending them back correspondingly to their places. There are conflicting rumors about Belladonna, in between his unknown background and unusually prolonged career, and the fact that he doesn't seem to be veritably aging, although everyone comments that he has always looked middle-aged ever since they've worked under him, and some even say he already was like that before he accepted this position. Some think he's some sort of immortal being, like a monster or a spirit, but why would one of their sorts just choose to have such a mundane job and life despite their advantages? Also, rumors spread once that he had been seen at the western coast talking with an equally aged pirate camouflage Lupe, and from their interaction they seemed like old friends or even family, the only connection he seems to have outside of his job.

An ambitious and sinister scientist under Dr. Sloth's command, there are only rumors as to how he has come to need so many cybernetic modifications on his body. Some say he was involved in a laboratorial accident, others say he was a victim of experiments himself, the stories go on. They all converge on the fact that probably the big boss himself was the one who did it, like he had done to others on his ranks,  and, from this event spawned Dr. Zakaraiah's obsession with going beyond the organic flesh to seek metallic perfection, both on himself and in others. And yet, despite this Shoyru being a vocal advocate for more robotic servants on Sloth's ranks, he is yet again and again assigned to deal with the classic mutation experiments on Neopians and beyond, much to his chagrin. And yet, he sees in his personal experiment, the A-5-0NNY bot, a chance to truly impress his boss and convey his passion and cause, and bring forth perhaps an entire next generation of easily mass producible underlings, to perhaps form the truly fearsome army that Sloth needs to take over Neopia for once and for all.

The young son of an important Neovian lawyer and a busy Neovian socialite, as well as his interest in books and learning difficult topics earns him praise all around from the adults around him, from the other high society Neopets that his mother knows to his school teachers. Because of his weak health throughout his entire life, he spent a lot of time at home, reading from his father's library and beyond, and has picked up quite the vocabulary... As well as a verbose talking quirk. Also, he is rather awkward socially, and his mother hates to see her son interact with the children of lower rungs he found himself involved with, she thinks they're bad influences, in between other things. And yet, she can do little to control him besides yelling at the maid that cares for him whenever she finds time, and try to push him to talk to kids of other well-off families, like Lucy. But Billy doesn't feel compelled to even really befriend Lucy, she just happens to be his neighbor who always follows him around, and, anyways, he'd would rather hang around those he can at least claim some level of superiority to order around, and to have their respect, which he couldn't fight for with children of the same social standing as him. Besides, his gang has come to adore him, mainly as of lately, with the discovery of his powers, and his infallible plot to terrorize the town has him clamoring for more.

<br><b>Story:</b>
<p>
The oldest child of a family of gardeners to a local questionable politician, he has both the brawns, having to help his parents at their work, and the smarts, having a stellar academic performance . He has a deep admiration towards Billy and his intellect, that earns him so much adult appraisal. And with good reason as well, Billy was the first and one of the few of that school to befriend him, so he is fiercely loyal to Billy's cause, even if it means being forceful towards the others. Outside of the school, he also is friends with Lucas, who he met in one of the many mischiefs the Jones siblings and friends had accomplished in the past, and is kind of jealous of Lucas's and Noah's dynamic. He doesn't care that much about Mariah, though, finding her to be a rather crude character (not to mention her whole demon thing), and he also only hangs around Lucy because she hangs with Billy as well, but he finds her mostly annoying.

A shy speckled Chomby from a migrant family from the outskirts of town, her closest friend is Leonie the camouflage Mynci, so she only tends to come along with the gang in their misadventures if he calls her. She goes to the same school as the Jones kids and her friend, where she isn't very liked nor approached by others, who tend to sneer and scowl at her for her more worn down reused uniforms and hand-me-downs and other visible signs of her family's lesser financial abilities. At first she was happy to have finally found a group of friends to hang out with, the gang that Leonie became a part of, but as of recently she has become wary that the acts they're committing are going too far, and it may all become a mess that will come back to bite her if she keeps on following along with Billy's ideas for crimes.

<p>
She may be the shorter of the trio of orphanage mates, but she definitely comes off as the most mature and reasonable of the three, acting as mediator and voice of reason in a lot of situations. She also is the most responsible of the trio, and back at the orphanage she is even used as an example to the other kids for her good behavior and grades. So it was more than a surprise to some that she accepted Billy's rhetoric and defends his strange new idea of using his powers to allow the gang to do more and even take revenge against those who have wronged them. She was even seen recently fighting against the other two she hangs out with, Slimy and Archie, defending the gang's acts of targeted vandalism.

An artist by heart, even if a macabre one at that, he's known for making monstrous creations out of rotten things found on the Woods, and subsequently terrorizing his neighborhood with said creations, much to his mother's chagrin. He's notoriously overdramatic and theatrical to the point that others at school find him grating and mock him constantly, he doesn't find many friendly faces in there, save for the Jones siblings, to some degree, and his only other closer friend, Jane. He was always concerned with the petty crimes and vandalism that the gang had participated over the years, and always thought the Jones siblings to be troublesome, but he always came along regardless because of lack of a better option. And yet, with Billy's plans as of recently, he's found himself drifting more and more from the rest of the gang.

The third of the orphanage trio, her nickname was given due to her appearance being similar to a giant Scamander, and she begrudgingly accepts it. She doesn't really have any other friends beyond the two others from her place, so she accepts being around the strange other friends of her own, even if she dislikes a lot some of the bolder and more troublesome characters, like Lucas and Richie. And yet, it was not a surprise then to learn that she was all for Billy Blake's plan of terrorizing the town of Neovia for their own gain, despite her concerns being many, including how dangerous it all became once the Koi Defender started chasing after them. Her surprise was from learning that Archie was against Billy's plot, which led to a terrible fight recently, and the trio finally broke up.

An Elephante not many know where she's from, but she is always in if Archie is in. She is amiable but rather distant from the rest of the group, she thinks the gang is too much for her, but since her friend hangs out with them she does as well, from time to time. With Billy imposing his plot over the group, she became even more distant, and barely talks to the others anymore, although she still hangs out with Archie.

Considering herself the matron of Neovian high society, Mrs. Blake is a known socialite from long time who has a penchant for pulling some strings from behind the curtains and "getting Neopets places" if she feels they've earned her favor. She took a liking to the young foreign Aisha who recently bought the long-abandoned mansion next to her husband's estate, and who so promptly volunteered to watch over her lonely son and help him with his studies, finding young Alice to be charmingly strong-headed and deeply naive, so Mrs. Blake can't help herself to attempt to dote on the Aisha, despite the latter's annoyance. Her recent affairs have been in dabbling in local politics, attempting to set up her favorite mayoral candidate, an outspoken, anger-led red Yurble who had been taking the town in a storm, for a win in the position.

The head of the Blake family, he works as a business lawyer for a Neovian firm, and thus is always out of the Haunted Woods for travels. The only time of the year he sees his family is during Winter Starlight season, and he has expressed in the past regret about his quite literal distance with his wife and son, but he can't put down his career any time soon. He does leave all of the domestic affairs to his wife's hand, both of the house and its finances and managing, and of Neovia and its social circles.

<p>
An Altadorian patrician who pridefully supported and answered to the Darkest Faerie as her general when she attempted to take over the kingdom, his leader's downfall was the cause for his shunning, and eventual isolation to the countryside. The last to his family name, he was left with only his lands and his house, and for years he lived like that, always plotting and hoping for the day he could help his Lady return to power. At some undetermined time, years later, he brought a bride to his familial oikos, a strange Hissi from an isolated island who always had to wear a blindfold over her eyes. The two reportedly had a child, but not much was heard of said child, given their isolation from Altador and general Neopian society. There was sparse rumors of the couple paying for private tutors and other aides to come over to their home over the years, but seemingly fewer ever returned after their time working over there, and those who did had few words to say about their experiences working under the villain and his family.

She was known as just a legend, a cautionary tale, of the one cursed to turning others into stone for having insulted a Faerie, who destroyed a town before being shunned off altogether and being run off into an island as response. That is, until a young Altadorian lord found her when searching for monsters, and took her back to his oikos instead. To avoid further accidents, she had compromised on covering her eyes, but she had a temper, and would discount her anger on the servants that came to work at her husband's lands if slighted in the worst manner, and thus she started growing a collection of statues once more, like the one she had back in her island. Despite the two being harmonious enough to bear a child, a young Kougra with a similar but lesser curse than her own, Chloria would eventually turn her eyes towards the Peophin that had sheltered her, an act that would lead her daughter to run off. After years of searching, she had found her daughter once more, now the family reduced to only the two of them, but even that didn't last for too long.

A timid dark Faerie that lived as an outcast, deep in the woods south of Neopia Central, at the base of the big continental mountains.

And that's how she met a young Kougra she took in as her apprentice. Too bad this drew in the attention of more villainous characters, who came after her and horrifically petrified her before taking that Kougra away.

A meek, strange child of a stranger family from deep within the Haunted Woods, he is burdened with many gifts, and future responsibilities to his kind. What kind, do you ask? The forest folk, the caves folk, the mountains folk, and the water folk, creatures that take the shape of Neopets but have long term attachments and origins in the depths of the large forested region that became known as the Haunted Woods, and all of those folks he is descended from. His mother is the de facto leader of all these folks brought together by bond and similarity, and he resembles her more than his father, but yet, he takes after his father's enchanting musical ability and affinity for bodies of water. And yet, despite all of his fantastical background, he studies in a normal, Neovian school, where he is regarded as strange and scary to some, and yet, he has found friendship with another strange Neopet, Mariah, who he feels has more in common with him than her siblings. He follows her around in and out of school, whenever he can, much to Lucas's irritation and Noah's mirth.

A spirit made solid through wood and magic, she is one of the stranger folks of the forest who decided to, despite all conventions, live in the town of Neovia. She is tall and imposing yet mysterious, and her back is hollow, but she hides it under her garments and cape, and she can perform several Earth magic feats, which she mostly uses as aids to her household tasks. An incident when she was barely a child left her mostly deaf, which is why her voice is booming, but she means no harm despite how scary she may seem at times. Now an adult, she inherited the mantle of head of her family and all the other families of strange folks in the Haunted Woods, which can conflict with her desire to be closer to more common folk, and makes her have to do several trips into the Haunted Woods to deal with questions of clanship.

A natural born artist and a spirit of water and vine, he plays any stringed instrument like it is second nature to him. With an entrancing nature that has earned him audiences and allowed him to make a living in the common world entertaining audiences with his magic. When it comes to family matters, he delegates to his wife, being rather distant from his pond-dwelling relatives that settle for a simple life of being lure and trap of unsuspecting travelers, despite how many morality clauses one can think of to justify when to do what with said traveler who comes across these inhabited bodies of water. He has taught his son on the art of the fiddle and charm, and on the intricacies and delicate nature of living in Neovian society while hiding their true nature as to not be ostracized, but his son is less apt for blending in, taking more after his mother.

The Blakes's maid, although she also almost serves as a governess to the young heir of the family, caring for him the entire day, since his parents are far too engrossed with their own endeavors, even though she still has to return to her family's residence in the southern part of town at the end of the night. She feels a bit sorry for the young Moehog, who has spent far too much time entrapped indoors while growing up, always sickly, always isolated, with growing strange obsessions with weird and dark stories and books on topics she finds are too intellectual and grossly scientific for his young age, developing too strangely for her, and has had several discussions with Mrs. Blake about the benefits of allowing her child to go out and "get some fresh air."

The Faerieland Castle Historian, she has the task of keeping track of her kingdom's history and beyond, writing down the records and keeping track of information that is relevant for her Queen's and court's decisions. She has a knack for music as well, preferring to invoke the memory of whatever topic she is requested to talk about while performing in her lyre or great harp, and swears by the power of remembering through music. She and her twin, Lethe, were originally from Brightvale, but Queen Fyora long requested they came to live in Faerieland and they both abided promptly.

The Faerieland Castle Archivist, she has the task of filing and organizing all of the heaps of information that is harnessed through the different sources from all over the kingdom and beyond, everything from taxation lists and censuses to news and fashion trends. She isn't as seen as her sister, preferring her solitude in the lower levels of the Castle unless she's called upon. Rumors back in Brightvale ran that her powers were that as whoever drank from her water would become a blank slate in their mind, which put the fear of many in visiting the twins, which contributed to them leaving for Faerieland.

<p>
The Faerieland Astronomer and Philosopher, she is an ex-pat from Altador, left out of it when it vanished from history due to a curse that befell, and once her land returned to existence, she had already accustomed herself to Faerieland. She has a stern and methodical nature to her due to her mathematically-heavy formation, and can come off as extremely dry and curt very often, which earns her a bad reputation from the other faeries, but no one could deny her excellent teaching at Faerieland Academy. And yet, it had been a few years since she had stepped down from the Academy, having been requested by the Queen for some job at the Castle no one knew what was about.

A Fire Faerie whose burning passion translates less to the literal and more to the literary sense, she is the Queen's and the Faerieland Court's personal speech trainer and press writer. She also loves writing poetry and prose on her own, and will even join with Mnemosyne every so often for singing and musical composition. She is very good at directing conversations as well, so whenever asked about more personal information, such as her place of origin, she tends to easily avoid responding to them. She does emphasize though that she is very happy in Faerieland, and with her Faerieland Castle Public Speech Trainer job, although she does sometimes come off as curt and short fused at times in the new job the Queen begged her to do, as it is a rather unusual position for her.

A prominent Ecologist in Faerieland and native from it as well, she too was a teacher at the Faerieland Academy, before stepping down for a private job from Queen Fyora herself. She has a great interest in the preservation of the Faerieland ecosystem, mainly after the Great Fall of Faerieland, and how mixing the two types of ecosystems, that of the ex-floating island and the one of the main continent, impacted the different species and the overall equilibrium. Just don't mention the Haunted Woods to her, as she will go into an entire rant about the long-term and long-reaching effects of the magic poisoning that the Neovians did to the land.

An air Faerie turned almost fully grey, she is regarded as unrepentantly lazy and discord-creating by her boss, and will cause any issue at will just for her own entertainment or to anger others. She was once a villainous and powerful young Faerie who had the plans of uprooting Faerieland's government and taking down the Faerie Queen, and yet she was caught quickly, and her punishment was stripping down of her powers. Nowadays she works under Star in eternal duty as further punishment.
