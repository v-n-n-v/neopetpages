Welcome to a fun way to do the Beauty Contest or to just get that artist block a moving. This is by no means a theme week or contest. It is just something fun for you to do on your own for the BC or to just challenge yourself. I have made and will continue to make more Bingo cards based on a number of themes and Ideas. Some are Neo related and some are not. <center><br><b>SO JUST HAVE FUN!</b>
<p><i>If there are any themes of bingo ideas you have please let me know</i></p></center>

<div class="subtitle">How does BC Bingo work?</div>

Well it is really very simple. Lets take the Classic BC Bingo for example. The classic is where you try and get a trophy in every pet species. You do this by using the pets you already have and draw them. For the pets you dont have well you have a few options. 1st option have a lab rat pet. These pets are great to use for this as they can change species when you zap them. 2nd option use cheap morphing potions on one of your pets. or  do a combination of options 1 and 2. 
<p>Now that is just for the classic BC bingo. These other bingos that I am creating are a little more simple. For example the NeoFoods bingos. All you have to do with them is incorporate the food item in the art in some form or another. This can be having the food in the art(ex your pet eating it) or use the food as inspiration to create say an outfit based on said food item.
<br></p><p></p><div class="title">Classic BC Bingo</div>
<center>This is classic BC Bingo. As stated before, all you have to do is win a trophy in every species. Note I did not make the classic Bingo sheet but it was shared to me by another Neo artist.

<div class="title">NeoFoods Bingo</div>
<center>Here are some Food related BC bingo cards. As I said before these ones are prompts to use the food item in the art in some form or another. It is up to the artist on how the food is used. I may add more neofood cards in the future.

<br><div class="title">Fashion Design BC Bingo</div>
<center>This is a bingo card based on fashion! I myself <i>LOVE</i> to design clothes. So I made a bingo card to play with. I have also added some color palettes as an optional challenge to each row. <b>If anyone would like more fashion inspired cards again let me know and i will gladly make more(which i plan on doing anyway.)</b>
