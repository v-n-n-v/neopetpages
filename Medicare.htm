<a id="how">Variations of UC Shuffle:</a></font><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/quiggle.gif"><br><br>

There are many variations of UC Shuffle! Make sure before you play, you read the first posts to understand the rules of the version you're playing.<br> Here are some of the most popular versions of UC Shuffles being played:<br><br><br><b><font color="blue">No Pass</font></b> --- There are no stipulations, no safety nets. Everyone who lists in this version WILL BE PICKING A BID AT THE END. This variation is higher risk, but usually attract WAY MORE BIDS than any other version.<br><br><b><font color="blue">Free Pass/Pass</font></b> --- Everyone who plays is allotted a pass on their pet. This variation often needs to have a capped pot, because there will be 20+ people who want to list due to no risk. These are usually more popular during slower trading times.<br><br><b><font color="blue">Same Tier</font></b> --- If you do not receive a bid that is at least the same tier as your listed pet, you may pass. (Eg. if you list a t5 and only get t4 or lower offers, you may pass)<br><br><b><font color="blue">Half and Half/ H&amp;H </font></b> --- List 2 pets to put in the pot. If both pets receive bids, you must trade at least one of them. You may pass on the other pet's bids. If you list one pet in this version, you will have no pass.<br><br><b><font color="blue">Color Exclusion</font></b> --- You may pick 1-2 (depending on the host) color exclusions on your listed pet from your tier. If you list a T5 and choose Faerie as your exclusion, if your only same tier bids are t5 faerie pets, you may pass.<br><br><b><font color="blue">Pet Exclusion </font></b> --- You may pick 1-2 (depending on the host) specific pet exclusions on your listed pet from your tier. E.g: If you list a T1 and choose Mutant Jetsam as your exclusion, if your only same tier bids are Mutant Jetsams, you may pass.<br><br><b><font color="blue">Goal</font></b> --- Choose 1-2 goal pets in your tier or below. If either are not bid on your pet, you may pass.<br><br><b><font color="blue">Shuffle Extravaganza</font></b> --- This is a special event held on the 1st of the month due to everyone having fresh transfers. It is usually hosted by many users throughout the course of the whole day.

<br><br><b><font color="blue">Ladder</font></b> --- Each pet listed may pass, UNLESS they receive a fair ladder bid. A fair ladder bid is: Same tier w/ same name format, or lower tier with a better name format, or higher tier with a worse name format. Extensive rule explanation of this variation can be found <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Mikurio">HERE</a>

 <br><br><br>There are other variations and clauses to these such as:<br><i>Name swap clause:</i>If the only eligible bid you receive would be a nameswap, you are allowed to pass on this offer. <br><i>Spicy Rule: </i> Refers to Half and Half Shuffles. Even if only one of your listed pets receives bids, you still MUST trade that pet. <br><br>
Other variations pop up from time to time, But these are the most common. When in doubt, <b>READ THE FIRST POSTS!</b>

So you want to host a UC shuffle board? AWESOME :D This is a section for the first posts and tips on how to be a good host!<br><br><b>First Posts of a UC Shuffle Board</b><br><br>This section is just guidelines as to what the board's title and first two posts can be, feel free to reword them or copy them straight from this page! Just make sure they're easy to understand, state the basic rules, and don't be upset if a new person asks questions or doesn't understand right away!<br><br>Make your Title VERY easy to see with lots of *clap* smilies, *violin* smilies and use the words <b>(Variation here) UC SHUFFLE</b> To attract people to your board. <br><br>You should make a <b><font color="red">LISTING BOARD</font></b> and a <b><font color="orange">BIDDING BOARD</font></b>. Also, you should dedicate one of your petpages for hosting the pot. You can use a preset layout, or just a basic blank page.  <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Hickups">HERE</a> is a lovely site with premade layouts for shuffling if you prefer. <br>Just make sure the pot is clearly read and all pets have their own line. You will link to this page on the FIRST POST of the Listing and Bidding boards<br><br>

IT. GO. <br>This is a FAN MADE game, run by FANS. We cannot enforce any of these made up rules, so let's be civil and douse any torches that come out if you're hosting. Keep it upbeat and positive.<br><br><b>Make sure you're hosting at a busy time on neo!</b> If the boards are dead, then there won't be a lot of good bids and people won't list. If the PC is hopping, this is the perfect time to host!<br><br><b>If you're unsure if there's enough interest, host a UC SHUFFLE INTEREST BOARD first!</b> Just flat out ask the PC "Hey who would like to play UC shuffle, listing or bidding? Let us know what you have so we can see if there's enough interest to play!" This helps listers be much braver to know they have a lot of support and won't regret playing :3<br><br><b>Know the rules well</b> This is just so that if a question comes up, and you have to make a call, you already know what to say. read over the rules page and be a good host! I already believe in you :3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/quiggle.gif"><a id="what"><font color="green" size="6">FAQs</font></a><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/quiggle.gif"><br><br><b><font size="4">Q:</font></b> Do I need a pet in the pot to play?
<br><b><font color="green"><font size="4">A:</font></font></b><font color="green"> No! You do not need a pet in the pot to play this game.
<br><br><br></font>


<b><font size="4">Q:</font></b>Can I bid a pet I put in the pot on other pets in the pot?
<br><b><font color="green"><font size="4">A:</font></font></b><font color="green">No. If you put your pet in the pot, this pet can no longer be bid on other pets in the current pot.
<br><br><br></font>

<b><font size="4">Q:</font></b>If someone plays and breaks the rules, can you do something about it?
<br><b><font color="green"><font size="4">A:</font></font></b> <font color="green">Plain and simple, no. The users who choose to volunteer their time to host can't force anyone to trade. However if someone intentionally breaks the rules or ghost you, you can mail the current host and let them know the situation privately. They may choose not to let the person list in games they host anymore, or mail them to ask they stick to bidding. Even though we are all adults left playing this children's site, some people choose to behave like children still so please don't let them ruin your fun by breaking the rules. Just make a mental note and move on :)
<br><br><br></font>

<b><font size="4">Q:</font></b>Can I host?
<br><b><font color="green"><font size="4">A:</font></font></b><font color="green">
YES! Anyone and everyone is welcome to host. Just please make sure you have read the rules thoroughly and know what's what! Also make sure you clearly specify what version of UC shuffle you'll be hosting so there's no confusion :3
<br><br><br></font>

<b><font size="4">Q:</font></b>Can I bid my pet on multiple shuffled pets?
<br><b><font color="green"><font size="4">A:</font></font></b><font color="green">Yes you can bid as many of your pets on as many of the auctions as you want. (As long as none of your offers are currently pets in the pot)
<br><br><br></font>


<b><font size="4">Q:</font></b>What happens when TWO or more shuffled pets pick the same bidded pet?
<br><b><font color="green"><font size="4">A:</font></font></b><font color="green"> The person who bid the pet must then choose which shuffled pet they want to trade for. The shuffled pet(s) that is not chosen must then pick another bid (or pass if applicable)
<br><br><br></font>

<b><font size="4">Q:</font></b>If I list and the bid I choose finds out they are out of transfers/Miss-types their bid/for some reason CANNOT trade the pet they bid on my pet/Is chosen for two pets and does not pick mine, DO I NEED TO PICK A NEW BID?
<br><b><font color="green"><font size="4">A:</font></font></b><font color="green">YES. YES. YES to all of these questions.<br><font size="5">ESPECIALLY IN A NO PASS UC SHUFFLE</font><br>
If the bid you select for whatever reason does not work out, and you have another eligible bid (And in the case of no pass, any bids whatsoever) YOU MUST SELECT ANOTHER BID. That is the whole point of these games is to make trades. And if this rule wasn't in place, people would abuse it to get out of following the rules and just trading. <b>THIS GAME IS MEANT TO MAKE TRADES. **NOT** UPTRADES!!!</b> Please don't ever list unless you understand that simple fact.  <br><br></font>
