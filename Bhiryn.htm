<h1>Tuesday, October 21st, 2014 <span class="u">∾</span>  Dreading This, But Farewell For Now</h1>

<span class="u">Dear Reader:</span><br> 
I didn't want to have to do this, but <b>I HAVE TO PUT MY PRECIOUS AURORA ON A HIATUS</b>... I just don't have the time for a graphics site right now. My other site <a href="/~Tormented_Sorrow">Dusk</a> will be up and running still (<i>for now anyways</i>). But as for Aurora, she must sleep like the beauty she is. I will hopefully be back soon, but I don't know when "soon" is. I could be back in a month or two. Maybe even several months to a year, but I hope to not be gone that long. <b>Note that ALL of Aurora's rules still apply even while on hiatus!</b> Please feel free to <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=dreading_tomorrow">contact me</a> if you have any comments, questions, or concerns, but please be patient because it may take me a little while to get back to you. <i>Thank you all for visiting my site and supporting it by using my content. I truly apprentice it. </i>

<br><br><span class="u">To My Affiliates:</span><br><b>Please do not remove Aurora!</b> I will be back soon, but of course I will understand if you do. Just please let me know so that I can unlist you when I get the chance. <i>I just wanted to let you all know that you guys and gals have amazing talents and I am so proud to be affiliated with all of you.</i> 

<br><br><span class="u">To My Listers:</span><br> Please <b>make Aurora an inactive site</b> for now and <b>do not remove Aurora</b> from your directories. I want Aurora to stay up so that others may use what my site has to offer. <i>Thank you so much for listing Aurora and a double thank you to those of you who listed Aurora as a recommended site. </i>

<br><br>I apologize for the inconvenience. I hope to bring back Aurora someday, so check back soon. I will hopefully finally open icon requests and have more content when I get back. I will truly miss making icons and resources for all of you. Farewell for now.

Hey everyone. I am working on some content, but it's slow going. I will have them ready and up as soon as I can.

<h5>Tuesday, September 9th, 2014 <span class="u">∾</span>  Swamped</h5>
Hey guys, sorry to say that I will be very slow at adding new content because I just have so much homework from college. I will NOT put Aurora on a hiatus and I will make sure to update, and add content, as much as I possibly can! I will just be slow about it, but there will be content added at least once or twice a month.

<h5>Tuesday, September 2nd, 2014 <span class="u">∾</span>  September Nights</h5>
Well I have decided to start making animated icons from Disney. Since I did that I also decided to split up the Disney icons a bit. There is now a Disney Cartoon section and a Disney Animated Section.

<h5>Wednesday, August 27th, 2014 <span class="u">∾</span>  Sick As Can Be</h5>
Hey guys, sorry for the lack of updates. I have been really sick and I don't seem to be getting any better. Bleh... Not to mention I'm starting school next Wednesday! I will try to stay up to date as much as I can and keep adding new content at least once a week. I don't think I will be adding anything this week though, not unless I make an amazing recovery from this horrible cold. Anyways, I will update you on more when I can and start making icons and resources soon. Thank you for your patience!

Alright, I finally had the time to add the rest of the icons that I was unable to add Monday. I hope you enjoy them!

<h5>Monday, August 18th, 2014 <span class="u">∾</span>  Design My Mind</h5>
Hey guys, I have a bunch of icons for you! I have so much more, but I will have to upload them later. I may only be able to update on Mondays from now on, but who knows. I may be able to other days too, but weekends are way to busy for me, and weekdays are almost as bad. Anyways, I hope you enjoy them all and I will have the rest up soon! Also I revamped the rules just a bit. If you have a well trafficked site, please upload the images you use to your own image hosting site. If you do not, then please by all means, take any image and use my image code. Just remember to leave credit!

<h5>Monday, August 11th, 2014 <span class="u">∾</span>  Icon Surprise</h5>
So I decided to make a few icons before I left for my class. As you can see, they are almost all Disney icons, with a few miscellaneous thrown into the mix. I am trying to get all the old cartooned movies out of the way, then I will add the digitally animated ones into the fold. I will have more for you guys soon, so check back later. I am still looking for suggestions on which Disney movies to add, animated, or cartooned. So, please <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=dreading_tomorrow&amp;subject=Aurora%3A+Disney+Icons">contact me</a> to give me some more ideas on what to add next.

<h5>Sunday, August 10th, 2014 <span class="u">∾</span>  Hellooo!</h5>
Sorry for the lack of updates, I have been very busy lately and my summer class starts tomorrow. I will most likely be very slow at updates from now on 'cause I will be starting school right after my summer class ends, but Aurora will NOT be going on hiatus! I will try as hard as I can to be up to date and not let my site get left on the shelf to collect dust like so many others have. I love Aurora way to much to let that happen!

Well, I am very happy to already hear good feed back about the Disney icons! Because of this, I would really like to hear your suggestions on which Disney movies I should add next. I have just been adding my personal favorites so far, but I'd like to know what all my lovely visitors would like added, so please <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=dreading_tomorrow&amp;subject=Aurora%3A+Disney+Icons">neomail me</a> your suggestions!

</h5>
I just added a Disney section, under movies for the icons. I know a lot of people love Disney movies and I am one of those people, so I decided to add some to Aurora! I have also been looking around and I noticed that Disney icons are in high demand at the moment. I hope you guys enjoy them and I will be adding more soon. I will also start naming the category of the icons and resources I add in my updates, so that you know what was added, and don't have to go looking for it yourself.

Just a few icons for you guys, they are all Neopet icons under the neo-related category. I hope you enjoy them! I will work on more stuff as soon as I can, so check back later. Again, I am so sorry about the wait guys! Also check out my new competition site <a href="/~Tormented_Sorrow">Dusk</a>! I currently have three competitions open at the moment, why don't you go have a look and sign up!

<h5>
<span class="h1u">Wednesday, July 23rd, 2014 <span class="u">∾</span> New Layout!</span>
</h5>
I finally got the new layout up and running! I'm sorry for the wait. Aurora will now be taking icon requests, but those won't be open for awhile and I will no longer be making banners. Also some things have come up in my life that are taking a toll on me at the moment, so I wont be updating more than once a week. I hope that I will get back to updating a lot more then that soon, but for now, once a week is all I have in me. 

<h5>
<span class="h1u">Tuesday, July 22nd, 2014 <span class="u">∾</span> AHHHHH!</span>
</h5>

Sorry guys. I have been so busy the past week, it all just kind of snuck up on me... I will be back with a new layout soon. I am unsure if I really like the new one yet or not, so I may not switch out yet. We will see I guess! I will be pretty busy this week too, so there may not be anything new yet. Stay tuned though!

Hey guys! I apologize for being a bit slow at adding content lately. I have been busy revamping the site. Aurora will be getting a new layout within the next few days, or maybe even today if I finished it by then. Sorry about the wait guys, I will get back on track soon!

Happy 4th of July to all from the United States! I hope everyone has a great day, whether they celebrate today or not. Anyways, I have been working on some new content, so I will hopefully get all that up within the next few days. Till then guys!

I finally got some more resources up! I still need to start adding banners, but I'll tackle that another day. I did a tiny little revamp of the site. I also tweaked the rules a little bit, so make sure to reread those. I would really like it if you guys would upload the images you use, but please don't think you can't leave credit. You still need to credit! I still made everything you see here, besides the textures.

So the Altador Cup ends today and I'm pretty sad I couldn't add more content for it like I had hoped to do, or play the games. Ah, well! Anyways, I finally got my computer set up (kinda) and I'm ready to get back to adding more content. I also feel a lot better today, I still need more rest, but all in good time!

I managed to get my computer yesterday and set up a lot of my stuff onto it. My surgery took a lot out of me, more so than my other one. I may be out longer than I had hoped. Wednesday is my new goal. I'm just a bit too slow at stuff right now. I'll keep you guys updated.

Hey guys, I'm feeling much better than I did yesterday. I was just so out of it! I had a different surgeon then last time and he did things much differently. Anyways, I'm going to try and crutch my way over to Best Buy and get my new computer today. I really do hope I'm back making graphics by Monday, but I honestly don't know yet. I will probably be sleeping off the general anesthesia for a while, which I didn't have during my left knee surgery last month. I have done nothing but sleep since last Thursday, so Monday doesn't seem like it will happen, but I still hope.

I couldn't pick up my new computer yesterday, because I was able to get knee surgery instead, which I needed much more than a computer. I will be bedridden for a few days and I will also be extending my hiatus for a little while longer. It may be a week and a half instead, but I will be back as soon as I possibly can. Who knows maybe I'll be back by Monday!

Okay, so I will definitely be having a mini hiatus! It will be most likely a week, maybe more. I had to order my computer, because it was out of stock. Oh well, at least this problem is getting fixed. I will still be here, but I just can't add any content to the site till I have a computer with my programs on it. I do apologize and Aurora will hopefully be up and running normally again soon!

Hey everyone! I will hopefully be taking this computer back today, yay! I really hope I don't get stuck with another dud, again. If I do end up returning it today, I will be on a mini hiatus for a few days to a week from this site, just till my new computer is set up. If I have to order a new one it will take me a bit longer then a week, depending on how long it takes to ship to the store. Bleh, can't wait till it's all over. Be back soon!

Wow, It has been raining non stop here. There have been flash floods, tornadoes, and severe thunder storms to have fun with all week and there is still more to come. I do love storms, but I don't like tornadoes! Well, I hope everyone else has been having better weather then me! Anyways, this computer is starting to fail me even worse then before, so I am definitely taking it back this weekend, or next weekend. I will be preparing for that by backing up all my stuff and content for this site. I will inform you when I take my mini hiatus to get my computer stuff together soon. I hope the computer I will be getting will be there in store and I won't have to order it. If I have to order it, my mini hiatus will be a bit longer.

<h5>Tuesday, June 17th, 2014 <span class="u">∾</span>  Good and Bad News</h5>

So the bad news is I went to pick up my computer and the man tells me that the warehouse found nothing wrong with it! Though the man admitted to me that his employee did find something wrong with it and that he believes his employee. He saw that I was pretty disappointed about this, so even though I am far past the return date, he told me I could exchange this one if I still keep having problems with it! Yay, this is great news in my book! If I keep having problems with this computer that I have been having problems with since I got it in January, I will obviously get a new one. The only thing about that is it will probably take me just a little while to get set back up on the new one. I'm sure it won't take longer then a few days, but I thought I should give you guys a heads up. I will inform you guys about my mini hiatus that will hopefully last no longer then a week before I take this computer back. I will most likely be, since the moment I turned it on it already showed me signs that it's still broken! UGH! Anyways guys, I will try to work on some content before I do anything. I want to make sure this is the right decision.

I can't even handle having my laptop on my lap for longer than a few minutes, but I came on to let you know I hope to be back on Monday, or at the latest Wednesday. I may not be on as much as I'd like for awhile, because I will be quite worn out from all of the physical therapy and doctors appointments. Though please don't think that will stop me from trying...

Hmm, <i>maybe</i>. I may or may not except a review, because of the fact that I am a <b>very sensitive</b> person.

I made <b>Aurora</b> to have <i>fun</i> and to push myself to <span class="u">improve</span> my graphic abilities. Right now my expertise level isn't that amazing, but I <i>hope</i> by creating this site I will hone my abilities, and become as close to mastering them as I can! I named this site <b>Aurora</b>, because I think the name is just <span class="u">lovely</span>, not to mention the aurora borealis/australis are so <i>beautiful</i>, and I also use the name for my continent in my role-playing world with my boyfriend. I was going to name it <span class="u">Aurora Borealis</span>, but I thought that was to <span class="u">long</span>, so I shortened it to <b>Aurora</b>. I plan on keeping <b>Aurora</b> up and running for as long as I am on Neopets, and that should be for a <i>long</i> time.

<h2>In Depth</h2>
As you can see my name is <span class="u">Jennifer</span>, but you can call me <i>Jen</i> or <i>Jenny</i> if you want. I am a <b>23 year old</b> college student who <i>can't decide on a major</i>. I suffer from a knee issue called <span class="u">Patellar Subluxation</span> and have been going through lots of <i>physical therapy</i> and <b>surgery</b> for it. I live in the <span class="u">United States of America</span>, but I wish to leave to explore the rest of the world. I have a big passion for learning as much as I can about <i>mythology</i> and <i>history</i>. I also run a fun little competition site called <a href="/~Tormented_Sorrow">Dusk</a>. Really, I could go on <i>forever</i>, but instead, you should check out my <a href="/~Briar_Heart">about me page</a> if you <span class="u">actually</span> want to hear more.
