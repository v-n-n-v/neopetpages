<a name="home"><h1>➜ Altador Cup Guide for Coniuro</h1></a>

<h2>Welcome!</h2>
This is meant to be a beginners guide to the Altador Cup. This guide will help you achieve Rank 1 and that spiffy avatar for guilds monthly challenge. If you have any questions, feel free to neomail me. Good luck!

<a name="one"><h1>➜ Ranking Up</h1></a>
The part of the Altador Cup that most people focus on is ranking up. Most people strive for All Star, or rank 20. But no matter what rank you want to be, you need to understand the basics of ranking up. <br>
Each rank requires that you earn a certain amount of rank points. The rank points go up as you get higher in rank. Thankully, TNT decided to put a handy rank calculator on the home page of the Altador Cup. This is found by clicking on Rank on your home page. You can find exactly how many games you would need to play to get to the next rank. Unfortunately, it only tells you how many games to play if you only played one game. You also have to remember that it only counts towards your rank if you submit a score above the minimum. Minimum scores for each game are found in their respective sections of this guide. You can do your own conversions using the point system below. <br><ul><li>1 Yooyuball Win- 1 rank point
</li><li>1 Yooyuball Draw- 1/2 rank point
</li><li>1 Slushie Slinger- 1/2 rank point
</li><li>1 Make Some Noise- 1/12 rank point
</li><li>1 Shootout Showdown- 1/12 rank point

<a name="two"><h1>➜ Yooyuball</h1></a>
Yooyuball is the cornerstone of the Altador Cup. It awards the most rank points but it also the most time consuming of the games. The goal of the game is to score more goals than the other team. I suggest submitting scores where you win or tie. Submitting a losing score does not help your rank and will count against your max submissions for the day. You can submit your score 46 times per day for this game. The easiest way I've found to score is to grab the ball and immediately start charging at the goal. If you should right above or below the goalie, you will almost always make it in. The picture below may better describe my tactics. There is no minimum score for this game, you just need to play it all the way through. As a side note, the game timer starts at 3 minutes. 8 seconds is deducted from the timer every time a goal is made, whether it was your team or the opponents goal.

<a name="three"><h1>➜ Slushie Slinger</h1></a>
Slushie Slinger gives the most points after Yooyuball. For every score submitted over 270, you will receive 1/2 of a rank point. You can submit your score for this game 81 times per day. This means that you can play 2 games of Slushie Slinger and have the same amount of rank points as 1 win in Yooyuball. This is a great game to play if Yooyuball just isn't your thing. The game is fairly simple once you catch on to the controls. The goal is to feed the customers the correct slushie and retrieve their cup once they are done. The customers will slide their cups back down the counter once they are finished. The key to this game is realizing that 1. the color of the smoothie does not have to be the same, which can be useful in a pinch and 2. the counters are actually different lengths. Knowing the counters are different lengths, instead of just visual effects, can really help your strategy when trying to get cups that are coming down the counter at the same time. I stick with grabbing the cups at the top first and working my way down. The graphic below shows the counter lengths.<br><ul><li>Color matching smoothie- 5 points
</li><li>Mismatched colored smoothie- 2 points
</li><li>Retrieved cup- 3 points

<a name="four"><h1>➜ Make Some Noise</h1></a>
Make Some Noise is a fairly simple game which can be done in a short amount of time but it also awards the least amount of rank points (along with Shootout Showdown). The minimum score for this game is 2700. There seems to have been a glitch in the first few days of the Altador Cup that would allow you to submit a score of 1200 and still count towards your rank. This is no longer the case. The max submissions for this game is 401 per day.<br>
My one tip for this game is to try to hit the buttons with the same hand. This seems to make the score rise quicker and your accuracy stay at 100. Other than that, mash away!
<br><br><br><img src="http://i53.photobucket.com/albums/g66/Brittany_Quigley/2016-06-12%202_zpsudz57djc.png" height="400"><p></p>


<a name="five"><h1>➜ Shootout Showdown</h1></a>
This is by far the quickest game (in my opinion) to play during the Altador Cup. The minimum score is 35 which is only 1 goal. Each score submitted only gives 1/12 of a rank point but with how quickly you can submit scores, you could easily max out the 401 game submissions in about an hour and a half. I don't really have any suggestions for this game, but if anyone has any tips for other players, I'd be happy to add them.
