<h5>What's Cookin', Good Lookin'?</h5>
   <div>
<h2>JAN<b>20</b>2012</h2>
<p>Blog neglect is a crime. Please don't report me...
<br>
I don't have a recipe for you today (maybe you should suggest one!). I've been really swamped with holidays, finals, the end of my classes, and all that jazz. <br>I've been quite enamored with my guild, Cardboard, and haven't payed nearly enough attention to my sites. WCGL deserves so much better. I'm working, slowly, on a new layout and as always, I'm collecting recipes to share with you guys! I'm a little discouraged with the lack of feedback, though. If you love WCLG, let me know! c:</p>
<hr><h2>DEC<b>13</b>2011</h2>
<p>Sometimes, there is simply nothing better than mashed potatoes. Around eleven o'clock last night was one of those times. Now is, again, one of those times. I've never been more thankful for leftovers. Seriously. 
<br>
I've been neglecting WCGL lately, but hopefully these 'taters will win you back into my favor. They're that good. And they're even better the next day. (That's why this recipe makes enough for  later!)</p>
<a name="mash"></a>
<br><center><i>Quick and Comforting Mashed Potatoes</i></center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_holidaypotato.gif" style="float: left;"><h4>3-4 medium yukon gold potatoes<br>
~1/4 cup of milk/half and half<br>
1/4 of an onion_ optional)<br> 
2 garlic cloves (optional)<br>
~2 tablespoons of cream cheese (room temp.)<br>
3 tablespoons of butter<br>
Shredded cheese (I like mexican, but occasionally I'll crave mozzarella, it's up to you.)<br>
Salt and pepper to taste</h4>
Quarter and boil potatoes until tender, about 12 minutes. While you're waiting, chop and saute onion and garlic, and set out cream cheese. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
<br>
Mash drained potatoes with butter and milk.
<br>Add in cream cheese, onion_  and garlic; continue to mash.
<br>This is where it gets interesting: break out your hand mixer and whip mashed potatoes until fluffy. Add in shredded cheese and whip some more. Scoop into an oven safe dish, sprinkle with cheese and bake for about 10 minutes.
<br>Remove from the oven, pack some away for later, and enjoy your dish wrapped in you favorite blanket on the couch!
<hr><h2>NOV<b>26</b>2011</h2>
<p>I hope everyone had a lovely Thanksgiving and an even better Black Friday! I know I got some really great deals yesterday :D
<br>
My new site, <a href="/~niojii">Kelp</a> is up and running as of yesterday. You should check it out!<br><br>As promised, I have a few great recipes straight from the Thanksgiving table. The first of which is one of my favorites - it's perfect for when you need to throw together something elegant.
</p>
<a name="plant"></a>
<br><center><i>Baked Eggplant Stacks</i></center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_cheery_tomatoes.gif" style="float: left;"><h4>1 large eggplant<br>
Fresh sliced mozzarella cheese<br>
~2 large tomatoes<br> 
Bread crumbs (optional)<br>
1 egg (optional)<br>
Flour (for drudging - optional)<br>
Salt and pepper to taste</h4>
Slice eggplant into 1/4 inch rounds and rub with salt. Let stand in a colander for about thirty minutes. *This draws water out of your eggplant slices so that they don't turn out rubbery.
<br>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
<br>Now is the time to bread your eggplants, if you're into that. I normally don't, but if you'd like to: coat in flour, dip in egg and then finish with bread crumbs. <i>Remember</i>: keep one hand dry (four &amp; crumbs) and one hand wet (egg) to minimize mess and be the most effective.
<br>Coat the bottom of a shallow dish with olive oil and place the eggplants so they don't overlap each other. Slice tomatoes according to your preference and place them on top. Finish the stack with a slice of mozzarella.
<br> Bake for 45 minutes or until tender. Enjoy!
<hr><h2>NOV<b>20</b>2011</h2>
<p>We joined a SOTM competition. Yaay. :'D
<br>I'm sorry the updates haven't really been flowing, I've been a busy with real life. I'm contemplating quite a few recipes to share with you guys.
<br>
We also have a new affiliate, be sure to go check out <a href="/~urre">Laugh Out Loud</a>!
</p>
<p>I'll be back with a delicious peppermint cake and other dishes for the up coming holidays sometime this week. Have something in mind for your thanksgiving table? I'd love to hear about it. Cheers!
<br></p>
<hr><h2>NOV<b>10</b>2011</h2>
<p>Yesterday was difficult, for reasons that don't belong on neopets, and I am happy to announce that today was nice and relaxing. But my ear is bothering me. :c
<br>My review site (<a href="/~pinwa">Bit &amp; Bridle</a>) just got a revamp that is mostly complete. All that coding is draining me. @-@
<br>I picked up a new basil plant on my way home- hopefully this one will survive here. I tend to kill plants. Maybe if I name this one, it will have more reason to live! Suggestions? I'm not really sure where to put this, so I guess you can find it in cold foods. Any-who, in my new housemate's honor, I present to you:
<a name="pesto"></a>
<br></p>
<center><i>Perfect Pesto</i></center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/fur_flytrapplant.gif" style="float: left;"><h4>2 cups fresh basil<br>
1/2 cup cilantro (or herb of choice)<br>
1/2 cup pine nuts<br> 
4-5 garlic gloves<br>
~1/2 cup olive oil<br>
1 TBSP fresh lemon juice<br>
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese<br>
(seasoning) Salt and pepper to taste</h4>
Mix ingredients and blend into a thick paste. Or process, if that's your thing.
<br>
Seriously, that's it. Add more of any of the above based on your personal tastes. Or anything else, for that matter! Found a different combination for pesto? I'd love to hear about it. 
<br><br><hr><h2>NOV<b>05</b>2011</h2>
<p>Chrome has been giving me problems lately. Specifically after the most recent update.
<br>
Is anyone else having a problem scrolling on pet pages? Let me know if you are, I don't want to be alone in this. D;
<br>I hope no one is having a problem with this page, I haven't encountered one yet. If this page, or any other page for that matter, isn't scrolling properly, reload it. I found this works about 98% of the time.
</p>
<p>Also! I'll be happy to take suggestion/requests/whatever from you guys as to what recipes you want to see. Just shoot me a neomail. Cheers!
<br><br></p>
<hr><h2>NOV<b>04</b>2011</h2>
<p>This is officially my first recipe I've taken from my kitchen at school, Roasted Vegetable Salad With a Basil Vinaigrette, and it's fantastic. Traditionally, it's chilled and served cold, but it's also delicious straight out of the oven! I used zucchini and butter neck, but feel free to use whatever squash you have on hand. c:
<a name="veg"></a>
<br></p>
<center><i>Roasted Vegetable Salad With a Basil Vinaigrette</i></center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_kebab_vegetable.gif" style="float: left;"><h4>1 Large Zucchini<br>
1 large butter neck squash<br>
1 large onion_ red or white) <br> 
2 large, peeled carrots<br>
(seasoning) Salt and pepper to taste</h4>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
<br>
Cut your squash into roughly 1/2 inch pieces and season with seasoning salt, pepper and garlic powder. Dice onion_ or cut into 1 inch pieces) and toss with the squash.
<br>
Cut carrots into 1/2 inch pieces and blanch<i>*</i> for about four minutes.
<h4>
<i>*</i>Blanching is a process in which food is partially cooked. Traditionally, it is boiled or steamed and then shocked in an ice bath. Boil (or steam) your carrots for about four minutes and then immediately place them in ice water. This not only ensures that they will cook the same speed as the squash, but also invokes a more vibrant color.
</h4>
Toss the carrots with your onions and squash and lay them flat on a baking tray. Bake for 10 minutes.
<br><br><center><i>Basil Vinaigrette Dressing</i></center>
<h4>2 Tablespoons of chopped fresh basil (or cilantro)<br>
1/2 cup of vegetable oil<br>
1 teaspoon of (brown) sugar<br>
1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard powder<br></h4>
Combine all ingredients and whisk. Drizzle over the roasted vegetables and serve. Enjoy! 
<br><br><hr><h2>NOV<b>03</b>2011</h2>
<p>I thought I'd start off my first entry with a little introduction as to why the page is actually here and all that jazz, so here it is:
</p>
<p>Construction of the site actually began October 30th, 2011 when I first discovered people actually had personal pages. In hopes of creating a dazzling pages, I came up with this - and it's going to have to do. I will be working hard to add recipes that I have enjoyed and share tips through updates as often as possible. I can't promise weekly updates, or anything of the sort, because I will only be online when I have time. And with full-time school, social events and sports, that's not very often, sadly.
</p>
<p>All recipes will have their own posts, even if they're on the same day so that the can be anchored more easily.
</p>
<p>Just for good measure, I'm going to start this off with a recipe that I have made countless times and that I will be making again tonight for my classmates to enjoy in the morning. Before we dive right into it, I want to stress the importance of weighing your ingredients, rather than measuring them. It's so much more accurate, seriously. I urge you to pick up a cheap kitchen scale if you don't already have one. They're awesome.
For those of you who didn't stop there so you could run out and buy one, I'll post the approximate measurements as well as the weights. c:
<br> This makes two or three mini-batches, depending on how big you make each cupcake.
<a name="red"></a>
<br></p>
<center><i>(Red) Velvet Mini-Cupcakes With Cream Cheese frosting</i></center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/klf_cupcake_banana_nut.gif" style="float: left;"><h4>(3.5 Tablespoons) 55g butter<br>
(3/4 cup) 150g of sugar<br>
1 egg<br>
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
1 / 4 teaspoon red (or any color of your choosing) food coloring <br>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
(1/2 cup) 120ml buttermilk<i>*</i><br>
(1 1/4 cup) 150g flour<br>
1 / 2 teaspoon baking soda<br>
1 teaspoon white vinegar<br><br><i>*</i> If you don't have buttermilk, you can substitute it for regular milk and lemon juice. One cup buttermilk = one cup milk PLUS 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice. In this case, you would add 1/2 tablespoon. Let the mixture sit for about three minutes.<br></h4>
Preheat oven to 340 degrees and place liners for cupcakes in a (mini) muffin pan. 
 <br>Sift flour and cocoa powder then combine. With a mixer, beat sugar and butter in a bowl until soft and fluffy. Continue to beat while adding the egg and vanilla extract. <br>
Add half the flour (+ cocoa) and the buttermilk. Mix well.
Then add the remaining flour. <br>
When the mixture is smooth, add the (red) food coloring. <br>
Finally, in a cup, mix the vinegar with baking soda and when it starts bubbling, add it to the mixture. Mix well enough to incorporate. <br>
Divvy the mixture into the muffin pan and bake for about 20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Let them cool 5 minutes in pan and then completely on wire rack.
<br><br><center><i>Cream Cheese Frosting</i></center>
<h4>4 Tablespoons butter at room temp.<br>
4 oz cream cheese (half a package)<br>
(about) 1/2 cup powdered sugar<br></h4>
Beat sugar and butter together and then add cream cheese. You can do this by hand or in a blender. Beware! Your kitchen can quickly turn into a snowy landscape if you're not paying attention while hand-mixing.
<br><p>
<b>To consider:</b>
<br>Cocoa powder is totally optional. If you are going for a lighter color (orange, green, ect.) I'd suggest you opt out of using it because it darkens the batter significantly.<br>
If you decide to color the frosting, you will want to add more powdered sugar to balance out the food coloring. 
<br><br></p>
<hr><h2>NOV<b>03</b>2011</h2>
<p>Here's a recipe that is a must for all get togethers (at my house). Everyone loves open-faced sandwiches, or so I'm told. These open-faced steak sandwiches are super easy, quite professional looking and absolutely delectable.</p>
<a name="steak"></a>
<br><center><i>Open-Faced Steak Sandwiches With Mozzarella Cheese</i></center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/spf_stake_sandwich.gif" style="float: left;"><h4>1 1/2LB package of beef cubes<br>
1 large french baguette<br>
Slices of mozzarella<br>
Hot oil (for frying)<br>
Salt and pepper to taste</h4>
<br><br>Heat oil on medium-high and preheat oven to 270. <br>
Cut the baguette into 1/2 inch slices and remove a bit off the end pieces so that they lay flat. Season beef chunks with salt and pepper (and whatever else you see fit).
<br>When oven is pre-heated, place beef chunks in an oven safe dish and cook for about 12 minutes for medium-rare, you can adjust cooking time based on your preference. Check on them every few minutes as the end time nears.
<br>While the steaks are cooking, fry each slice of bread on both sides (about 8 seconds each side) and place on a paper towel. When all of the bread is fried, pat dry and arrange on a tray with no pieces overlapping.
<br>Remove the steaks from the oven. (<i>Recommended:</i> Pan fry steaks 1-2 minutes on each side. If you decide not to, you may want to leave them in the oven another few minutes.) Cut the steaks length wise into thin, wide strips and place individually on the bread slices. Top with sliced mozzarella and enjoy!
