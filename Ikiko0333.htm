<br><b>The Easiest Recipes</b><br>
Compiled by: dumpling<br><br>
Someone asked about 3-ingredient budget-friendly de-stressor recipes, so I compiled a list of the simplest recipes on this page and some general ideas. This is by no means complete and I'm sure I missed some recipes, so do take a look through the page and feel free to add more and ask Qs on the board. Remember that all recipes can be modified! Happy experimenting :)<br><br>
#1 - What do you like to eat? (Or not like?)<br><br>
For ex, my go-to foods are: toast or banana + peanut butter, yogurt + berries, oats, eggs, chocolate. They check all the boxes: healthy carbs, fats, protein, nutrients, time, cost, good feelings. But that's me. (I've been trying to sell my family on peanut butter for years and they're not budging.) Try different things and find a balance that works for you :)<br><br>
Simple stuff with 3-4 ingredients:<br><br>
Omelets (eggs + any veg you have)<br>
PB &amp; banana sandwich (toast + PB + banana + raisins)
<br>(^I learned this in elem school and still make it all the time)<br>
Toast + nut/seed butter + honey<br>
Oatmeal (w/ fruit, nuts, honey)<br>
Avocado toast + egg<br>
Cucu-mber sandwiches (toast + butter + cucu + British TV)<br>
Baked &amp; mashed potatoes<br>
Fried rice (rice + eggs + any veg)<br>
Baked fish (w/ Italian or bagel seasoning + veg on side)<br>
Tasty has a video on 3-ingredient dinners that looks really good!<br><br>

<div class="box"><br><b>Homey Crepes</b><br>
Credit: Family recipe :)<br><br>
Note: This is not your traditional French crepe. My family hails from Eastern Europe so this may be a regional variation, or it's just a family recipe. We've been making crepes this way for as long as I can remember. When I was little we would have them for breakfast almost every weekend. <br><br>
I've seen crepe recipes online that often include baking powder, vanilla extract, etc… We have these in the pantry but never use them. You can make a great crepe with just a fry pan, flour, milk, eggs, a pinch each of salt and sugar, and butter/oil for the pan. All measurements are approx.<br><br>
TOOLS:<br>
fry pan (we often use two)<br>
ladle or large spoon<br>
spatula to flip (or a steady hand and confidence!)<br><br>
BATTER:<br>
1-1.5 cup white flour *<br>
1 cup milk**, to consistency<br>
4 eggs<br>
pinch of sugar<br>
pinch of salt<br><br>
+butter or oil for the pan (we usually use olive oil)<br><br>
TIPS:<br>
* All white will produce smoother flavor/texture. All whole wheat will produce a blander, tougher crepe. We often do half-half, for the nutrition and much better taste.<br><br>
** Try any milk. Cow milk + white flour will produce a smooth, solid crepe. Plant/nut milks often result in a crepe full of small holes. (Haven't tried coconut milk.) We usually use plant milks anyway ^^<br><br>
INSTRUCTIONS:<br>
0. Open the windows and/or turn on a fan. If you use butter, it can get smoky. We recommend oil.<br><br>
1. Whisk the batter ingredients together. Aim for the consistency of alfredo sauce. If the batter is too runny, add a bit of flour. If it's too thick, add some milk or water. (If too thick, it won't spread well in the pan and won't cook through.)<br><br>
2. Heat a fry pan and lower to medium-low temp. Drizzle butter or oil on the fry pan. (Do this before each crepe.)<br><br>
3. Tilt the pan and pour a scoop of batter starting at the top of the pan. Quickly tilt the pan in a circle to spread the batter all around evenly. It should be thin and cover the bottom of the pan.<br><br>
4. When the crepe is ready to flip, it'll turn light golden brown on the bottom and be cooked enough that it slides in the pan. Flip it using a spatula and cook until bottom is also light golden brown.<br><br>
5. Remove the crepe to a plate to cool. Adjust batter and heat as necessary. Repeat with the rest of the batter.<br><br>
6. Top with toppings of your choice, roll it up like a burrito, tuck the end, and enjoy! (If your crepes are full of holes, double up and roll two at a time.)<br><br>
TOPPINGS:<br>
- Jam<br>
- Chocolate spread<br>
- Fruit (banana, strawberries, blueberries, …)<br>
- Nut butter<br>
- Honey or maple syrup<br>
- Tomatoes, cucu-mbers and feta cheese<br>
- Whatever you like!<br><br>
Growing up, we always had a few different jams to eat on the crepes. These days, we often top with peanut/almond butter, fruit and a drizzle of maple syrup. Bon appetit!

<br><b>Cottage Cheese Blintzes</b><br>
Posted by: Coyote (dalikalak)<br><br>
I have a great recipe for cottage cheese blintzes. It's on my actives petpage if you wanna add it. :3<br><br>
Original recipe yields 15 servings<br><br><b>▪️Crepes:</b><br><br>
3 eggs<br><br>
1 cup milk<br><br>
2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br><br>
¾ cup all-purpose flour<br><br>
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed<br><br><b>▪️Filling:</b><br><br>
2 (16 ounce) containers small curd cottage cheese, very well drained<br><br>
2 egg yolks<br><br>
¼ cup white sugar<br><br>
2 tablespoons lemon juice<br><br>
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed<br><br>
Step 1 Whisk together the eggs, milk, and 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a bowl; gradually add in the flour, whisking to remove all lumps<br><br>
Step 2 Brush a small skil.let with 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, and heat over medium-high heat. Pour about 2 tablespoons of batter per crepe into the heated ski.llet, and tilt the pan to completely cover the surface with batter. Crepes should be about 5 inches in diameter. Cook the crepes until golden on the bottom, and set but not wet on top, 1 to 2 minutes per crepe. Don't flip the crepes. Set the cooked crepes aside.<br><br>
Step 3 Mix the cottage cheese, egg yolks, sugar, and lemon juice in a bowl until very well combined. To fill, place a crepe in front of you on a work surface with the cooked side up, and place about 1/4 cup of cheese filling in the center of the crepe. Fold the right and left edges of the crepe over the filling, and roll the crepe over to seal the filling in, making a compact little roll filled with cheese. Set the blintzes aside.<br><br>
Step 4 Heat 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil in a large ski.llet over medium-low heat, and place the filled blintzes into the hot skil.let. Pan-fry the blintzes until golden brown on each side, about 2 minutes per side. Eat hot or cold.<br><br>
Cook's Note It's best to begin draining the cottage cheese first off, since it can take awhile. The less liquid in the cottage cheese, the easier it will be to make the crepe. Using a colander or sieve is best, so long as the holes aren't too big.

<br><b>Banana Pancakes</b><br>
Posted by: Livs (sutilidade)<br><br>
Banana pancakes: 1 egg, 1 banana, honey.<br><br>
Peel a banana and mash with a fork, place in a bowl and place 1 egg and beat with the fork like an omelet, place in the pan with a strand of oil or butter to avoid sticking, throw, and that's it... just turn later and serve with honey<br><br>
Comment from dumpling:<br>
Yess I second those pancakes! I make them with 2 eggs. This is a great way to use very ripe bananas :D<br><br>
Tip from Thais (snorlaxa):<br>
(Paraphrased) To make them dairy free, substitute the egg with oat flour and mix until the batter is sticky.<br><br>

Posted by: Kesa (kesa_skye)<br><br>
Everyone seems to be making sourdough in qtine, so here's a recipe for your discarded sourdough starter!<br><br>
The absolute BEST pancake/waffles you will ever eat in your life:<br><br>
First you'll need to make an overnight sponge:<br>
1 cup flour<br>
1 tablespoon sugar<br>
1 cup buttermilk<br>
1/2 cup sourdough starter<br><br>
Mix the above ingredients together in a large bowl, then cover it and let it sit overnight at room temperature.<br><br>
THE NEXT MORNING:<br>
1 egg<br>
2 tablespoons oil<br>
1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br>
1/2 teaspoon vanilla (can add more/less depending on your taste!)<br>
All of the overnight sponge<br><br>
In a small bowl, whisk together egg, vanilla, and oil. Add to the overnight sponge. Then add the salt and baking soda, stir to combine. Pour batter into a waffle iron or a pan, serve warm! They're a bit of work but seriously THE BEST pancakes I've ever had

<br><b>Yogurt Waffles</b><br>
Credit: Martha Stewart<br>
Posted by: Dumpling (dumpling130)<br><br>
It's Waffle Weekend at our home! :D
When we were growing up, my mom would make crepes every weekend without fail, so now we have a family tradition of having something in the pancake/waffle family at least once per month (but often more heheh) :P I tested a bunch of waffle recipes a while back. Here are a couple I keep coming back to :)<br><br>
Yogurt Waffles by Martha Stewart<br><br>
INGREDIENTS:<br>
* 3/4 cup all-purpose flour<br>
* 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour<br>
* 1/2 cup rolled oats (not quick-cooking)<br>
* 3/4 tsp coarse salt (omit if using salted butter)<br>
* 2 tsp baking powder<br>
* 1 tsp baking soda<br>
* 1/4 cup packed light-brown sugar<br>
* 3 Tbsp melted unsalted butter, plus more for iron<br>
* 3 large eggs<br>
* 1 1/2 cups plain, regular or low-fat yogurt<br><br>
INSTRUCTIONS:<br>
In a large bowl, whisk together flours, oats, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. In another bowl, whisk together brown sugar, butter, eggs, and yogurt until smooth. Stir egg mixture into flour mixture and mix well to combine. Let batter sit 15 minutes.<br><br>
Heat waffle iron according to manufacturers instructions; brush with melted butter. Pour 1/2 cup batter onto iron and close; cook until waffle is golden brown and crisp, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack set on a baking sheet and place in low-temperature oven to keep warm; repeat with remaining batter.<br><br>
COMMENTS:<br>
The waffles are simple, wholesome and delicious! They keep well in the refrigerator (and probably freezer…? Ours never last that long) so you can pop some in the toaster on the lowest setting to re-crisp. <br><br>
 We top them with berries, banana and maple syrup, or a bit of jam when rushing out the door.  Martha says "These waffles pair nicely with plain or vanilla yogurt and maple syrup." I thought that would just make them soggy, but it's actually a great (and smart!) combo! Yogurt on the inside and yogurt on the outside feels healthy :) The refreshing, palate-cleansing taste of the yogurt accentuates the sweetness of the maple syrup, so you end up using less, but still satisfying that sweet tooth :* And you get full faster :o Omnom :D<br><br>

<div class="box"><br><b>Chili Cheese Omelette</b><br>
Posted by: ACe (acexcat13)<br><br>
I make my own chili (at four hours, NOT A simple recipe) but turns out yummy! Also make a bunch all at once and freeze it so there's more for later.<br><br>
For a chili cheese omelette, canned chili works too, and it's 15 seconds to open the can and 2 minutes to microwave while the egg cooks. To that with cheese+yogurt (or sour cream) and done!<br><br>
Getting the eggs right is always the challenge, but once you get that, whole thing can be start to finish in 4 minutes or so, and it never fails to impress.<br><br>
Also, it needs to be a thing at the giant omelette, huh? *clap*

<br><b>Baked Eggy Toast</b><br>
Posted by: Wren (erikacasey)<br><br>
Here's an easy recipe! I don't remember where I picked this one up, but it's so filling and delicious. It is a breakfast recipe, but I usually find myself making it for dinner after a long day.<br><br>
Baked Eggy Toast<br><br>
1 piece of thick-sliced bread<br>
1 egg<br>
1 green onion_<br> 
2 tsp mayonnaise<br>
1/8 cup shredded cheese<br>
salt and pepper to taste<br><br>
Preheat oven to 350F and set up baking tray with parchment. Put your bread on the tray, and flatten out the middle using a spoon. Apply mayonnaise evenly over the bread. C.rack egg into the middle of the bread (if you flattened the middle enough, it should hold without spilling over the sides). Add chopped green onion_ cheese, salt and pepper to taste. Bake for 15 minutes.<br><br>
If you make this please feel free to NM me and let me know how it came out or any modifications you made to make it your own! I love discussing and sharing recipes<br><br>
Ahaha also just realized this recipe is totally on-brand with my avatar

<br><b>TIP: Avocado Toast w/ Garlic</b><br>
Posted by: Mega (megafoo4452)<br><br>
Also if anyone's ever had avocado toast, try mashing them with fresh garlic and a squeeze of lemon juice. Delicious!<br><br>
Comment from Thais (snorlaxa):<br><br>
I made the avocado + garlic today, it was nice! ^^<br><br>
Comments from Dumpling (dumpling130):<br><br>
Made some avocado toast with garlic! Tasty! :D<br><br>
I only added half a clove (using a garlic press) and a subtle kick came through very nicely. Personally I prefer a simpler avocado toast with just salt, pepper, and lemon juice, but I might add a whole clove if topping it with egg or something else. Omnom :3<br><br>

Slice of toast + mayo + smoked salmon + fried egg, topped with salt, pepper and paprika. You can swap the mayo for avocado mashed with a little lemon/lime juice and salt. Poached egg works well also. Cooking the egg for 2-3 min should yield a runny yolk. Tasty, light, and filling :) This is also great for brunch!<br><br>
^ I also have this without salmon. The mayo + egg combo is so good

How to make a poached egg:<br><br>
Bring water to boil in a small pot and lower heat to a light simmer. Optional: add 2 tsp of apple cider vinegar. It won't affect the flavor.<br><br>
Use a spoon to stir the water quickly and create a vortex.<br><br>
Cra-ck an egg and drop it into the vortex. The egg white will whirl around and stay together. Fresh eggs tend to stay intact more.<br><br>
Cook 2-3 min for a runny yolk - it'll be jiggly, bouncy to the touch.

<br><b>Poached Eggs (2)</b><br>
Posted by: Nebula (josephinefarine)<br><br>
hi dumpling! i have an easy cooking tip to share! ^^<br><br>
how to make a perfect poached egg every time:<br><br>
1. In a small pot, boil enough water to cover an egg. Add salt if you want.<br>
2. While the water boils, break an egg against a flat service, and into a cup. Make sure the yolk isn't broken!<br>
3. Once the water is boiling, gently drop the egg into the water. You can swirl the boiling water with a spoon first, to keep the egg more together.<br>
4. TURN OFF THE HEAT, put a lid on the saucepan, and set a timer for 2 mins (or a little longer, if it's a big egg). The egg will poach in the hot water.<br>
5. Gently removed the poached egg with a slotted spoon and onto a towel.<br><br>
Voila!! Flawless, no fuss, no stress poached egg with a beautiful runny yolk!! I recommend eating it on avocado toast with bagel seasoning, or as a topping on some savory oatmeal :*<br><br>
(Thank you for sharing!!)<br><br>
yay you're welcome! i love browsing your recipe page!
i noticed there's another poached egg tip, but two tips are always better than one! :*<br><br>

<br><b>TIP: Fresh egg storage</b><br>
Posted by: B (sheridanicole2)<br><br>
Also if your eggs are fresh from the bum don't wash em. They'll last much longer. Advice not recipe lol.<br><br>

Comment from dumpling:<br><br>
*lol* Great tip! Thank you! :D<br>
Incidentally, this is why commercially bought eggs have to be refrigerated in some countries. In the US, the egg cleaning process required for safety standards strips the eggs of a natural protective barrier and makes them more susceptible to spoilage. Meanwhile, in Europe, eggs undergo less processing and can safely be stored at room temperature. Both are safe (:<br><br>
Comment from B:<br>
I do agree with the eggs being stripped of natural barriers in US. That's why we have chickens !<br><br>

Mix the base ingredients + flavor of your choice in a large mug / small bowl. Cover and rest in the fridge for 6+ hours or overnight. Will keep in the fridge for 1-2 days, maybe more. <br><br>
(The ingredients add up to ~1.5 cups total. I mixed them directly in a large glass Irish mug.)<br><br>
Base:<br>
1/2 cup rolled oats<br>
1 Tbsp chia seeds<br>
pinch of salt<br>
1/4 cup yogurt<br>
1-2 tsp honey / maple syrup (TT)<br>
1/2 cup milk (plant or regular)<br>
* (flavor)<br><br>
Flavors!<br><br>
Blueberry:<br>
Add 1/2 cup blueberries to the base, and 1-2 tsp lemon rind if you like. Top w/ blueberries and almonds before serving.<br><br>
Chocolate-Banana:<br>
1/2 banana (I used 1 whole) + 1 Tbsp cocoa powder. Topping: banana slices &amp; chocolate shavings<br><br>
Tropical:<br>
1/2 cup pineapple or mango chunks + 1 Tbsp desiccated/shredded coconut. Goes well with coconut milk in the base. Topping: fruit chunks and more coconut<br><br>
Apple pie:<br>
1/2 cup chopped or grated apple (chopped is more flavorful) + 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Topping: walnuts or pecans (toast them in a dry pan on stovetop for a few min for extra crunch!)<br><br>
Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly:<br>
2 Tbsp peanut butter + 1-2 Tbsp fruit jam. Topping: crushed peanuts and peanut butter<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
Blackberry:<br>
1/2 cup blackberries, and use 2 tsp honey instead of maple syrup. Topping: toasted walnuts*<br><br>
* Two ways to toast raw walnuts (or any raw nuts):<br>
1. Chop raw nuts (optional if using oven).
2a. Toast in a dry pan/skil-let over low-medium heat until fragrant, about 10-15 min. Stir frequently to prevent burning.
2b. Spread out in a single layer on a dry baking sheet/dish and bake for 5-8 min @ 350 F or while oven is preheating, stirring every 3 min, until fragrant.

<br><b>Purple Oatmeal</b><br>
Posted by: A (dragon_lover533)<br><br>
I'm not super good at cooking but here's my two favorite recipes:<br><br>
Purple Oatmeal<br>
- blend a hefty amount of blueberries and 1-2 peeled bananas<br>
- add mix to 1-2 cups boiling water, allow to cook for 2-5 min<br>
- stir in 0.5-1 cup old fashioned oatmeal, serve<br>
- (optional: stir in a fistful of whole blueberries &amp; banana slices)<br>
- makes 1-2 bowls oatmeal<br><br>
try it immediately, it's SO good. and the fact that it's made with water not milk &amp; has no added sugar means it's healthier than the oatmeal I used to make, so I eat gobs of it lol<br><br>
I like my oats crisp, like in cookies, so I don't cook them at all. If you prefer cooked oats then they actually take 5-10 min in boiling water at a 2:1 ratio<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
Notes from dumpling (Jan 24, 2021)<br><br>
Yummy! Beautifully purple (more like the first pic below). I cooked it for about 10 minutes and added the optional fruit at the end. I interpreted fistful as one of each fruit, so in TOTAL I had the oats + 1.5-2 bananas + 1 cup blueberries = very filling!! I recommend adding 1 fistfull total ^^; I still finished it x) The fruit digests quickly and the oats keep you full so it's not like a food baby :)<br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/og2nbgrwdc3ap5i/PurpleOatmeal-1.jpg" width="200" height="150"> ~ <img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/tsxc3pwb18ugbqq/PurpleOatmeal-2.jpg" width="200" height="150"><br><i><font size="2">(To view full pic, drag and drop the image into your browser's address line or right click and open image in a new tab.)</font></i>

This is intriguing. I love oatmeal, though I've never tried savory ones. My mom puts feta cheese and cayenne pepper in hers. You guys might be onto something here… Btw I'll add this one to the page, too! And def need to try it myself. Don't knock it till you try it, right? (:<br><br>

Credit: Workweek Lunch(?)<br>
Posted by: Anna (unfogging)<br><br>
My favorite recipe right now is chocolate peanut butter baked oatmeal!<br><br>
Ingredients:<br><br>
cooking spray<br>
2 ripe banana<br>
1 TBSP vanilla extract<br>
1/4 cup honey<br>
sub maple syrup<br>
1/3 cup nut butter of your choice<br>
3/4 cup milk of your choice<br>
2 cup old fashioned oats<br>
2 TBSP cocoa powder<br>
3 TBSP protein powder (2 scoops, optional)<br>
1 TBSP chia seeds (optional)<br>
1 tsp baking powder<br>
chocolate chips<br><br>
Step 1/5<br>
Coat a baking dish (9x9" is ideal) with cooking spray and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350F / 175C.<br><br>
Step 2/5<br>
In a large bowl, mash the bananas with a fork or potato masher. Add in the vanilla extract and nut butter and stir well to combine.<br><br>
Step 3/5<br>
To the same bowl, add the milk and honey and mix well with the bananas and vanilla until smooth. Add the oats, baking powder, cocoa powder, protein powder (if using) and chia seeds. Mix well.<br><br>
Step 4/5<br>
Pour the batter into the baking dish. Sprinkle some chocolate chips on top if using. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the center appears cooked/fork or toothpick comes out clean.<br><br>
Step 5/5<br>
Let the baked oatmeal cool completely in the pan, and then slice into 8 pieces.<br><br>
Been prepping this every week now. I love enjoying it with some yogurt or fruit with more nut butter on top! I usually use peanut butter but almond butter is great too.<br><br>
Oh and the recipe is from Workweek Lunch ^_^<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
Comment from Dumpling (Feb 2023):<br>
I made this! I used Black Magic chocolate protein powder and almond butter bc that's what I had on hand and they worked well. I thought the cocoa wouldn't be enough, but stuck to the recipe and it was actually quite rich. One issue I had was the toothpick did not come out clean even after adding extra baking time. It was still fine, just had more of a brownie texture. I might add 1-2 Tbsp of shredded coconut or coconut flour next time to absorb some moisture. And maybe pecans on top for some crunch. I served it with a drizzle of almond butter, and a bowl of yogurt and fruit on the side. Overall, great quick breakfast! Thanks!<br><br>

<div class="box"><br><b>Healthy Breakfast Cookies | Almond Joy!</b><br>
Credit: Dani Spies, Clean and Delicious<br><br>
Prep Time: 10 mins<br>
Cook Time: 15 mins (+ multiple batches)<br>
Total Time: 25 mins<br><br>
Makes 24 x 1-2 inch cookies<br><br>
INGREDIENTS:<br><br>
* 1/2 cup coconut oil (SUB: butter)<br>
* 15 drops stevia (SUB: 1-2 Tbsp maple syrup or honey)<br>
* 1 egg beaten<br>
* 1 ripe banana, mashed (mine was ~1/2 cup)<br>
* 2 1/4 cups rolled oats<br>
* 1 tsp. baking powder<br>
* 1/3 cup chocolate chips (SUB: chopped chocolate)<br>
* 1/4 cup shredded coconut<br>
* 1/4 cup almonds chopped<br>
* 1/4 tsp kosher salt<br><br>
TIP: If possible, use chopped chocolate in your baking. Premade chocolate chips are nicely shaped, but often have more sugar than anything else. I usually buy a few bars of a decent quality semi-sweet or dark chocolate (56-72% cocoa) that is on sale, chop that up and throw it in. The flavor is bolder and the uneven chopping give the final product a more rustic, personalized touch :)<br><br>
INSTRUCTIONS:<br><br>
1. Pre heat oven to 350 F. Lightly grease a rimmed baking sheet, or line with a silat mat, parchment paper, aluminum foil, etc. and set aside.<br><br>
2. Mash banana in a large bowl using the back of your fork. Add in one beaten egg, stevia or maple syrup, coconut oil or butter, rolled oats, baking powder and salt. Stir until everything is well combined. <br><br>
3. Add in the coconut, almond, and chocolate chips and gently stir until all of the mix-ins are well incorporated. <br><br>
4. Scoop one tablespoon of batter and shape into a cookie. Place on baking sheet and continue until you have worked through all the dough (you will need to work in batches). <br><br>
5. Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through. Cool and enjoy!<br><br>
NOTES:<br><br>
I used butter, 2 Tbsp maple syrup and chopped choco, and the cookie was not too sweet / just right. Add more sweetener if you prefer. If you make 3-in cookies, as I did, add 2-5 min baking time.<br><br>
The cookies are crispy out of the oven. After cooling and storing them in an airtight container, they softened a bit. Not a bad thing. They'll probably re-crisp after a few min in a hot oven.<br><br>
The coconut flavor is very light, but that could be because mine is a little expired ^^; Do not add much more coconut as it has a drying effect and the batter is crumbly as is.<br><br>
The almonds flavor is undetectable. I'll try toasting them first next time. If they don't burn, that should add a nice crunch.<br><br>
FLAVOR SUGGESTIONS:<br><br>
Chocolate chips + almonds + 1/2 tsp almond extract<br>
Chocolate chips + pecans (instead of almonds)<br>
Rains + pecans/walnuts + 1/8 or 1/4 tsp cinnamon<br>
Any other ideas? Post or NM me.

It's mild and filling, I definitely recommend it! I ended up using all-purpose flour since I didn't have wheat flour on hand. It came out really thick and filling- perfect for breakfast! :-D<br><br>
I won't lie I panicked and ended up adding more flour and milk than called for- reminder that it thickens up eventually haha.<br><br>

<br><b>Grain Free Cookie Cereal</b><br>
Credit: Wholesome Lee<br>
Posted by: Dumpling (dumpling130)<br><br>
These cookies are healthy and delicious with or without milk!! We tried two of Lee's recipes and recommend this one. (The one with only oat flour was just ok imho.) The chocolate chip cookies are classic. We also made some "plain" cookies, without any add-ins (by accident, forgot the chips hah), and family and friends all loved this version more so we just omit the choco altogether now. There are more flavor combo ideas on the recipe website.<br><br>
We typically use almond butter or peanut butter, maple syrup, and toasting the coconut is optional. Rolling the cookies will take 20-30 min bc they're so small. We get ~140 cookies per batch. When rolling the cookies, put a little bit of oil on your hands and the dough will be less sticky and easier to work with. Overbake 1-3 min until golden brown so they're crunchier and hold up in milk ^^b<br><br>
INGREDIENTS<br><br>
* 1.5 cups almond flour (178g)<br>
* 1/2 cup toasted desiccated coconut (38g)<br>
* 4 Tbsp monk fruit sweetened maple syrup OR any sticky sweetener of choice (pure maple, honey etc.)<br>
* 1/2 tsp baking soda<br>
* 2 Tbsp nut butter of choice<br>
* 1 egg OR flax egg if vegan<br>
* 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips (or finely chopped chocolate; optional)<br><br>
INSTRUCTIONS <br><br>
* Combine all ingredients together in a bowl stirring in chocolate chips last. <br>
* Line a cookie baking tray with baking paper and roll mixture into tiny ba-lls (around 0.5 cm each). <br>
* Place them on the baking tray and flatten with a fork to make small cookies. <br>
* Bake in the oven at 180 degrees Celsius (350 F) for roughly 8-10 min until golden brown. <br>
* Set aside and allow to cool. The cookies should harden. <br>
* Divide cookies into an even batch of 6 servings. <br>
* Store in an airtight glass container to keep cookie cereal fresh! Enjoy!<br><br>

<br><b>Miracle Granola</b><br>
Credit: John Whaite<br>
Posted by: Dumpling (Dumpling130)<br><br>
This is a fantastic stovetop granola that takes 10-30 minutes, depending on how toasted you like it. (Normally granola takes about 45 minutes to bake in the oven.) The video of this recipe is on John Whaite's Instagram highlights.<br><br>
Ingredients:<br><br>
3/8 cup nuts, coarsely chopped (75 g)<br>
3/4 cup seeds (120 g)<br><br>
4 Tbsp (1/2 stick) of butter (60 g)<br>
3/8 cup light brown sugar (60 g)<br>
1/4 cup maple syrup (60 g)<br><br>
2 cups rolled oats (200 g)<br><br>
1/2 cup dried fruit (100 g)<br><br>
Instructions:<br><br>
Toast the nuts and seeds in a dry fry pan on medium-low heat, 5-10 min. Stir frequently. Pumpkin seeds will start popping when they get crispy. Be careful not to burn* them! When they're fragrant and crunchy, put them in a mixing bowl. (Wipe the pan with a paper towel if there are burnt flakes.)<br><br>
Return the pan to medium heat and add the butter. Let the butter melt and sizzle. Add the sugar and maple syrup and mix. Add oats and stir to coat them completely in buttery sugariness. Once they're well covered, toast them for another minute. Add them to the nuts/seeds and mix.<br><br>
When the mixture has cooled, add the dried fruit.<br><br>
Enjoy on yogurt, ice cream, etc.<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
Notes from dumpling:<br><br>
In the recipe video, John used pecans and pumpkin seeds, and cranberries for the fruit. <br><br>
I used pecans, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds. I toasted them together on medium-low heat. The smaller pieces will toast faster, so  watch them and stir frequently. I made them extra toasted and could smell some burnt flakes, so I put them in a sieve and stirred to get those bits out, then transferred to the bowl. The seeds will continue cra-ckling from residual heat :D<br><br>
The granola is great even without dried fruit. I added raisins and it was too sweet for my taste, so you may want to reduce the sugar/syrup slightly if using raisins. Will try cranberries next time.<br><br>

Well i know how to make Earl Grey Muffins.<br><br>
You just take the tea bags and soak them in the milk you are going to use in the fridge overnight.<br>
Then use that milk in a basic muffin mix and BAM they taste like earl grey tea w/ sugar and cream.<br>
Use as many bags as you want for taste. It's all up to your personal preference. :)<br><br>

<br><b>Basic Muffin Recipe</b><br>
Credit: Baked by an Introvert<br>
Posted by: Dumpling (Dumpling130)<br><br>
I Poogled for a basic muffin recipe to use for <a href="#11a">TIP: Earl Grey Muffins</a> and found this. The recipe is good. The (plain) muffins are simple, not too sweet, soft and a little dense. (If you prefer fluffier muffins, see <a href="#36d">Coffee and Pecan Crumble Muffins</a> below.) This recipe is easy to modify and add fruit, choco chips, etc. Would be great with vanilla or almond extract. Substitutions I use: plain flour, coconut sugar, and oat milk. Next time I'll sub in 25-50% wheat flour for a heartier flavor.<br><br>
UPDATE: Mine were a bit dry on the second day. Be sure not to over bake them, and remove them from the hot pan (mine were done in 20 min but I took them out late). Trying 50% butter and 50% neutral oil (sunflower, etc) is also a good idea.<br><br>
YIELD: 12 MUFFINS<br><br>
Ingredients<br>
* 2 cups (260 g) all-purpose flour<br>
* 1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar<br>
* 2 teaspoons baking powder<br>
* 1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
* 3/4 cup (180 ml) milk, room temperature<br>
* 1/2 cup (114 g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled<br>
* 2 large eggs, room temperature<br>
* 2 tablespoons coarse sugar, optional<br><br>
Instructions<br>
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a muffin pan with paper liners; set aside.<br><br>
2. In a small bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together.<br><br>
3. In a medium bowl, whisk the milk, butter, and eggs together until well combined.<br><br>
4. Add the flour mixture and stir with a silicone spatula just until combined. (Stir until there are no more streaks of flour. Do not over-mix. It's okay if the batter is lumpy.)<br><br>
5. Divide the batter evenly between the muffin cups and sprinkle the tops with coarse sugar if using.<br><br>
6. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with only a few moist crumbs attached.<br><br>
7. Transfer muffins to a wire rack to cool completely. Store the muffins in an airtight container and at room temperature for up to 3 days or refrigerate for up to 1 week.<br><br>
Check out the original recipe for substitutions (oil/butter, yogurt, etc) and variation ideas:<br>
* Blueberry Muffins<br>
* Cranberry Orange Muffins<br>
* Apple Cinnamon Muffins<br>
* Lemon Poppy Seed Muffins<br>

John posted a video of this recipe on his Instagram stories/highlights months ago and they looked really good. I finally tried them and they. are. good! Very fluffy and cake-like. Classic coffee shop muffin, but better bc it's homemade. This recipe should work well with the <a href="#11a">TIP: Earl Grey Muffins</a> -- simply omit the coffee and hot water, pecans, and crumble.<br><br>
Makes 6 muffins<br>
(John got 4 in his IG recipe)<br><br>
For the crumble:<br>
* 1/3 cup plain flour (50 g)<br>
* 2.5 Tbsp unsalted butter (35 g)<br>
* 2 Tbsp light brown sugar (25 g)<br><br>
For the batter:<br><br>
Dry ingredients:<br>
* 3/4 cup + 2 Tbsp plain flour (125 g)<br>
* 1 tsp baking powder<br>
* 1/2 tsp salt<br>
* 3/8 cup light brown sugar (60 g)<br>
* 1/2 cup chopped pecans, toasted (60 g)<br><br>
Wet ingredients:<br>
* 1 tsp instant coffee<br>
* 1 Tbsp hot water (to dissolve the coffee)<br>
* 1/4 cup yogurt (60 g)<br>
* 1/4 cup milk (65 g)<br>
* 1 large egg<br>
* 1/4 cup neutral oil (sunflower, etc) (60 g)<br><br>
Instructions:<br><br>
1. Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F.<br><br>
2. Toast the nuts! Spread them on a baking sheet and bake for 5-8 minutes while the oven is preheating (they burn easily, so stir once or twice and watch them) or toast in a dry fry pan on the stovetop on medium-low heat (stir frequently) until crunchy.<br><br>
3. Crumble: In a small bowl, rub the butter into the flour and sugar with your fingers until all the butter breaks up and the crumbs start clumping together.<br><br>
4. Sift the dry ingredients into a mixing bowl and mix in the pecans.<br><br>
5. Put the instant coffee and hot water in a medium bowl and stir to dissolve the coffee. Add the milk and yogurt and mix. Add the egg and mix. Add the oil and mix well.<br><br>
6. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Mix until just incorporated. Do not over-mix.<br><br>
7. Divide the batter evenly b/w the muffin cups. Top generously with the crumble mixture.<br><br>
8. Bake for 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (a few crumbs is okay). Enjoy!

<div class="box"><br><b>Blueberry-Carrot Muffins</b><br><br>
Yield: 12 muffins (standard-size)<br>
157 kcal / muffin<br><br>
The original recipe is "Whole Wheat Blueberry Muffins" from Weight Watchers. It was a random find and unfortunately really bland, so I modified it, a lot, with help from family and friends. They have a rustic look, but are fluffy inside, taste great and are still light and healthy! :)<br><br>
INGREDIENTS &amp; PREPARATION<br><br>
PREHEAT oven to 325 F. Lightly grease a muffin tin or use cupcake / muffin liners.<br><br>
BOWL #1 (big): Mix / whisk:<br>
1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour<br>
1/2 cup all purpose flour<br>
1 tsp baking soda<br>
1/2 tsp salt (omit if using salted butter)<br><br>
BOWL #2 (medium): Mix / whisk:<br>
1 large egg, beaten w/ a fork<br>
2 Tbsp butter, melted<br>
1 tsp vanilla extract (SUB: lemon juice)<br>
2 tsp lemon zest (~1 lemon)<br>
3/4 cup maple syrup (SUB: 1/2 cup raw or coconut sugar)**<br>
1 cup grated carrots (SUB: very ripe bananas, mashed or apple sauce*)<br><br>
PREP:<br>
1 1/2 cup blueberries (SUB: chopped apples)<br><br>
POUR liquid mixture (#2) into dry mixture (#1) and stir until just blended. Do not over-mix. Gently fold in blueberries. Batter will be sticky.<br><br>
SPOON batter into muffin tin. Try to tuck in the berries a bit so it doesn't look like a battlefield later (see pic). Optional: Top with a sprinkle of lemon zest (this doesn't do anything, just looks pretty pre-baking 0:))<br><br>
BAKE at 325 F for 25-28 min or until toothpick poked in the center comes out clean. Cool 10 min. Enjoy!<br><br>
NOTES:<br>
 * The original recipe calls for apple sauce, all wheat flour and raw sugar. It's pretty bland, bc of the apple sauce. However, it may pair well well chopped apples.<br><br>
** If you use sugar, mix it with the dry ingredients (#1); if you use maple syrup, mix it with the liquids (#2).<br><br>

I have leftover Haagen Dazs vanilla and matcha ice cream that's just taking up space in the freezer and nobody's eating it (too sweet... also Haagen Dazs's matcha has almost no flavor, don't bother!). Time to try that ice cream bread Brittiny posted once upon a time :D<br><br>
Ok so... The ice cream bread is really good!! *lol*<br><br> 
I was a little short on ice cream and didn't want to open a new box, so I scaled the recipe down a bit and filled 6 muffin cups. Should've done 8 bc they ballooned up into nice puffy tennis ba-lls!<br><br>
I think the texture is similar to that of an American biscuit (though it's been a while since I had those, so don't quote me on this) and have a hint of the ice cream flavors, in my case Haagen Dazs vanilla. This would be superb with some butter or jam for breakfast :*<br><br>
I overbaked them a bit at 30 min (muffins are usually done in 25-8 min in my oven) but they were still perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy inside.<br><br>
2 are gone already and I don't know if any will survive until breakfast :P Om nom nom :3<br><br>
Afterthought: This will be a great excuse to try more ice cream brands, and if we don't like one, well, bake it 0:-)

Credit: John Whaite (video on IG story highlights)<br><br>
John Whaite was a contestant on the Great British Baking Show Season 3 and went on to bake professionally. He's posting lots of recipes and shows you how to make them at home. Watch his video and you'll be inspired to make your own pastry in no time!<br><br>
He is English so he uses metric measurements. Approx US conversions added. Don't worry too much if you're off by a tsp or two.<br><br>
I made this twice, and both times it was absolutely delicious! I used substitutes for the sugar bc of what I had on hand and explain that in the notes.<br><br>
DIRECTIONS:<br><br>
#0: Preheat oven to 150 C fan, 170 C conventional. Line a 2-pound loaf tin with parchment paper and grease lightly.<br><br>
(170 C = 338 F. I used an 8x8 inch pan, lined with aluminum foil, lightly greased with coconut oil.)<br><br>
#1: In a small pot: Heat on high until melted and turn off:<br>
* 135 g hot water (1/2 cup)<br>
* 80 g butter (1/3 cup)<br><br>
#2: Whisk in a big bowl:<br>
* 215 g plain flour<br>(1 1/3 cup = 21.5 Tbsp + 1 tsp)<br>
* 1.5 tsp baking powder<br>
* 1 tsp baking soda<br>
* 55 g cocoa powder<br>(1/2 cup - 2/3 cup = 8 Tbsp - 10.5 Tbsp)<br>
* 270 g light brown muscavado sugar<br>(1 1/3 cup + 1 tsp) (SUB: Brown sugar. See notes.)<br><br>
#3: In a small bowl: Mix:<br>
* 160 g yoghurt (2/3 cup + 1 tsp)<br>
* 1 tsp lemon juice<br><br>
#4: Add yoghurt mixture (#3) to water/butter mixture (#1), whisk to incorporate.<br><br>
#5: Add 2 eggs to dry ingredients<br><br>
#6: Pour liquid mix quickly into dry mix and whisk. Be sure to scra-pe the sides and bottom of the bowl to incorporate everything. Mix until it's a nice smooth batter.<br><br>
#7: Pour into the baking dish and bake.<br><br>
#8: Baking time will be approx. 1 hour, or until toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Oven temperatures vary, so check at 45 min, add 5-10 min increments as necessary.<br><br>
Enjoy! :D<br><br>
NOTES: <br><br>
Muscovado sugar:<br><br> 
If you don't have muscovado sugar, just use brown or coconut or really whatever sugar you have on hand.<br><br>
Google says: You can also make a comparable sugar the same way you make brown sugar: 1 cup of white sugar + 2 Tbsp molasses = stir until it's the consistency of wet sand.<br><br>
1st time I made this, I tried 1 cup coconut sugar + 2 Tbsp molasses. Texture was perfect! Firm and easy to spread butter. Flavor was...interesting (lol) I enjoyed it with peanut butter. My brother loved it as is. (He is usually constructively critical.)<br><br>
2nd time, I used 1 cup maple syrup. It was fluffy! And a bit moist on the bottom, so there was probably a little too much liquid. If you want to use maple syrup, sub only 25-50% of the sugar (remember to reduce other liquids by 1-2 Tbsp)<br><br>
Cocoa:<br><br>
I used natural cocoa both times, but both natural and Dutch-processed cocoa should work just as well.

<br><b>Delicious Pumpkin Bread</b><br>
Posted by: Shiloh (kunabee_tiger)<br><br>
OK OK OK OK I have a recipe finally!!!! It actually is gonna take me two posts to transcribe the recipe but I'll just take my time with that lol.<br><br>
It's the most epic pumpkin bread I have ever tasted. It is so exceptionally melt-in-your-mouth moist. Like. It's so soft. And so good.<br><br>
Delicious Pumpkin Bread<br><br>
2 cups all-purpose flour. You don't want to pack the flour down, but however you get it in there is good.<br>
1/2 tsp salt<br>
1 tsp baking soda<br>
1/2 tsp baking powder<br>
1 tsp ground cloves, ground cinnamon, and ground nutmeg<br>
3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened (it won't mix right if it's hard, but I just pop my butter in the microwave for 30 minutes lol)<br>
2 cups sugar<br>
2 large eggs<br>
1 15-oz can 100% pure pumpkin (this is a big can, you might be surprised)<br><br>
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (162 or 163 degrees C). Generously grease two 8x4-inch loaf pans. The original says use butter and flour, but I actually use parchment paper on the bottom and spray the sides with baking spray. In a medium bowl, combine the dry ingredients - flour, salt, baking soda and powder, and the spices. Whisk until well-combined. In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar until they're just blended. For electric mixers, use medium speed.<br><br>
Once the butter and sugar are juust barely blended, add the eggs one at a time and beat well. Continue beating until they're light and fluffy - this will take a few minutes. Once it's well-mixed, beat in the pumpkin. It's gonna look ugly at this point, like it's curdled, but it's SUPPOSED to do that. Add the flour mixture and mix everything together until combined. Then, divide the batter evenly into the pans and bake for 65 to 75 minutes (ymmv depending on oven).<br><br>

Q&amp;A:<br>
Q: Thank you for the recipe! :D Pumpkin bread has been on my mind for a while but experimenting with ratios is daunting sometimes :P Gonna save this one for the winter :)<br><br>
A: ... And yeah, I LOVE this pumpkin bread recipe. It's absolutely incredible and very easy to double. Although if you triple it, it will probably overflow.<br><br>
The bread is so sooooooftttt.<br><br>
Q: Do you really need 2 loaf tins? Does it rise a lot? And do you think it's possible to cut the sugar a bit? I usually put 1 cup in banana bread, but I know the bananas add sweetness and pumpkin is pretty bland on its own, hence the spices and all that, so it'll probably need more than 1 cup.<br><br>
A: I haven't put in LESS sugar, but I imagine you could put in less. maybe cut it off by half a cup? I've also used sugar substitute and that comes out just fine.<br><br>
You could probably put it in one loaf tin, but it would be a Very Tall Boy and may overflow. It'd definitely be right at the top with just one loaf tin.<br><br>
I also put it in a big flat cake tin and had that come out just fine bcuz it was a thin layer on the bottom and it went to the top from there.<br><br>
Could add honey instead of sugar and cut out an egg or both eggs with the honey, probably, but I wouldn't know the exact substitutions for that.<br><br>
It might even be possible to drop to a single cup of sugar and just add more spices. That'd make it much less sweet and add a lot more of the cinnamon/nutmeg/cloves flavor to it.<br><br>
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br><br>
Update from Dumpling (Dec 8, 2022):<br>
Shiloh...<br>
Your pumpkin bread. Is. Divine! It's so moist and crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside and not too sweet and it's absolutely delicious. We're not even big fans of pumpkin, but my mom said it's her favorite loaf cake so far :D Thank you so much for the recipe! ♡<br><br>
I only made half a batch bc I'm alone now and didn't want to eat the whole thing by myself, but I'm kinda regretting it now haha I see what you mean about it rising well. It rose about 3/4 up in my loaf pan. I feel like a whole batch might barely fit in one pan because the dough is thick and the parchment paper can keep it in place...? That or it'll overflow and look like a mushroom lol It would be delicious either way :3 Highly recommend it!<br><br>

Easy, delicious, and your kitchen will smell heavenly! You can find the video of this recipe on John's Instagram Highlights reel. I finally got a kitchen scale a few days before making this (great investment btw!), but did my best to record approx cup measurements.<br><br>
Dry ingredients:<br>
* 3 1/8 cup plain flour (450 g) (stir before measuring)<br>
* pinch salt<br>
* 1/2 c + 2 tsp caster sugar (85 g)<br>
* 3.5 tsp baking powder (15 g)<br>
* 1 tsp cinnamon<br>
* 1/2 tsp ground ginger<br>
* 1/4 tsp ground cardamom<br>
* 1/4 tsp ground allspice<br>
* 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg<br>
* 1/8 tsp ground clove<br><br>
Add butter to dry mix:<br>
* 6 Tbsp butter, room temp (80 g)<br><br>
Wet ingredients:<br>
* 1/2 cup + 1 Tbsp canned pumpkin puree (150 g)<br>
* buttermilk (150 g)<br>
 SUB: 75 g milk + 75 g natural yogurt (1/4 cup + 1 Tbsp of each)<br>
* 1 tsp vinegar<br><br>
To finish:<br>
* Egg yolk, beaten, to glaze<br>
* Pumpkin seeds<br>
* Pearl sugar (optional)<br><br>
INSTRUCTIONS<br><br>
1. Line a baking sheet with a non-stick mat, parchment paper, or foil. Lightly grease if using foil.<br><br>
2. Toss dry ingredients together then rub in butter to breadcrumb consistency.<br><br>
3. Mix wet ingredients in a small bowl then add to dry and work into a smooth dough.<br><br>
4. Lightly sprinkle flour on your work surface (kitchen counter, cutting board, etc) and dough. Flatten dough into thick disc (by hand or rolling pin), 7-8 inches in diameter, and cut into 8 wedges. Leave to rest for 20 min while oven preheats.<br><br>
5. Preheat oven to 200 C fan / 220 C conventional (425 F conventional)<br><br>
6. Glaze with beaten egg yolk. Sprinkle the seeds and sugar on top and bake for 12-15 min until golden brown.<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
NOTES: The recipe said bake for 15 min, but mine were a little over done. Check after 12 min and add time as needed. I used coconut sugar, hence the darker golden brown color. Highly recommend trying these with a little butter, jam, or yogurt :D<br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/6e9968ynmnsjiwy/PumpkinSpiceScones-1.JPG" width="200" height="150"> ~ <img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/jshtnyxa189pdr9/PumpkinSpiceScones-2.JPG" width="200" height="150"><br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/ncqmes0fsk5shjb/PumpkinSpiceScones-3.JPG" width="200" height="150"><br><i><font size="2">(To view full pic, drag and drop the image into your browser's address line or right click and open image in a new tab.)</font></i>

<br><b>TIP: Stunningly Moist Banana Bread</b><br>
Posted by: Jules (jules_tucker27)<br><br>
I've learned that using six mashed bananas (not four or five) and adding one pack of vanilla pudding powder to a banana bread recipes makes it so stunningly moist and delicious. Can't beat it.<br><br>
Q: Thanks for the banana bread tip! The pudding is a great idea. Many use yogurt or sour cream, but I hadn't seen pudding before. But how do you fit 6 bananas in there?? Would it bake through?<br><br>
A: So you'd put in the pudding powder with the dry ingredients, not the ready made pudding! I know it sounds like a lot of bananas, but I use this much in my recipe and it makes about 20 muffins baking for 22-23 minutes at 325F and they're perfect every time! I load 'em up with fixens too - dark chocolate chips, shredded coconut but can confirm they work plain too ^^<br><br>

Um, an easy recipe? If you haven't made bread before King Arthur Flour's Hearth Bread is a very easy one to start with and doesn't require anything too special (:<br><br>
Note from Dumpling: Just looked up the bread recipe and love how simple it is! This seems like a great recipe for beginners and I'd love to try kneading by hand. Thank you for sharing! :)<br><br>
Followup from Dumpling (Jan 2022):<br>
I finally kneaded my first bread! It started snowing in the afternoon and the smell of powder snow reminded me of that warm, cozy feeling of fresh bread in the oven and I gave this a try :) The flavor is simple. The crust came out veeery crunchy, while the inside is nice and soft, so this bread would be perfect with a little olive oil or along with hot soup. Just Google the recipe and follow the instructions. Prep/mixing/kneading take about 10-15 min, then you leave it to rest. When you shape the loaves, follow the gif and fold them like a letter. I didn't shape mine evenly and they're a little asymmetrical, but no biggie, they won't last long anyway ;)<br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/438y4knv212a133/HearthBread1.jpg" width="200" height="150"> ~ <img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/9ffywmqpx4wk89v/HearthBread2.JPG" width="200" height="150"><br><br><i><font size="2">(To view full pic, drag and drop the image into your browser's address line or right click and open image in a new tab.)</font></i><br><br>

<br><b>Japanese Milk Bread (Tangzhong)</b><br>
Credit: King Arthur<br>
Posted by: Merill (fern_mouse20)<br><br>
hi, i just saw your reply from last night to my mentioning that i was making tangzhong milk bread! it was easy, the recipe just requires a simple roux beforehand. i used the recipe from the king arthur site!<br><br>
INGREDIENTS:<br><br>
Tangzhong (starter):<br><br>
3 tablespoons (43g) water<br>
3 tablespoons (43g) whole milk<br>
2 tablespoons (14g) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour<br><br>
Dough:<br><br>
2 1/2 cups (298g) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour<br>
2 tablespoons (14g) Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk<br>
1/4 cup (50g) sugar<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
1 tablespoon instant yeast<br>
1/2 cup (113g) whole milk<br>
1 large egg<br>
4 tablespoons (57g) unsalted butter, melted<br><br>
INSTRUCTIONS<br><br>
1. To make the tangzhong: Combine all of the ingredients in a small saucepan, and whisk until no lumps remain.<br><br>
2. Place the saucepan over low heat, and cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until thick and the whisk leaves lines on the bottom of the pan, about 3 to 5 minutes.<br><br>
3. Transfer the tangzhong to a small mixing bowl or measuring cup and let it cool to room temperature.<br><br>
4. To make the dough: Combine the tangzhong with the remaining dough ingredients, then mix and knead — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — until a smooth, elastic dough forms.<br><br>
5. Shape the dough into a ball, and let it rest in a lightly greased covered bowl for 60 to 90 minutes, until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk.<br><br>
6. Gently deflate the dough (gently punch down in the middle), divide it into 8-9 equal pieces, and shape each piece into a ball.<br><br>
7. Place the rolls into a lightly greased 8" or 9" round cake pan. Cover the pan, and let the rolls rest for 40 to 50 minutes, until puffy.<br><br>
8. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Brush the rolls with milk or egg wash (1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon cold water), and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown on top; a digital thermometer inserted into the center of the middle roll should read at least 190°F.<br><br>
9. Remove the rolls from the oven. Allow them to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a rack to cool completely.<br><br>

Notes from dumpling (dumpling130) (Nov 2020)<br><br>
Technically it's not a quick bread, but I had to add it to the page!<br><br>
This bread is incredible! The flavor is richer and the texture is fluffier and more moist than a typical dinner roll. The recipe is very simple, it just takes a while bc the dough needs to rest and rise. My family loves bread so we invested in a bread machine many years ago (~150 USD). Our machine dough setting takes 2.5 hrs and covers steps 4 &amp; 5 above. A stand mixer will cover step 4. Without either, it'll take a little work to knead the dough, but you'll get a nice arm workout and immense sense of satisfaction (^_^)<br><br>
I used dry yeast (not instant) and that worked fine for me with room temp or warm ingredients.<br><br>
King Arthur has two versions of this recipe: rolls and loaves. The ingredients and steps are the same; the only difference is how to split the dough for the different shape. To get loaves, simply divide the dough into 4 pieces, flatten each into a rectangle, then fold and roll to get a loaf shape. Place them in a row in a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Search on Poogle for more.<br><br>
If you search Tangzhong milk bread on YooyuTube, the first video by Umi is a great reference!<br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/ya8i2ehiq8drmwb/MilkBreadRolls-1.JPG" width="200" height="150"> ~ <img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/oirn802mzhgji9x/MilkBreadRolls-2.JPG" width="200" height="150"><br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/w9kbaf08goi7q0v/MilkBreadRolls-3.JPG" width="150" height="200"><br>(Fluffy layers! :3)<br><i><font size="2">(To view full pic, drag and drop the image into your browser's address line or right click and open image in a new tab.)</font></i>

<div class="box">
<br><b>TIP: Toasted nuts</b><br><br>
This may seem super basic, but I never thought about it until recently and it elevated my baking and snacking :D<br><br>
Why toast raw nuts? They become more crunchy and flavorful. Toasted nuts are ideal to use in quick bread batters. Some nuts become easier to eat (ie almonds).<br><br>
Why not buy toasted nuts? Raw nuts are more versatile - you can use them raw, toast them and flavor them however you like (candied nuts!). Store-bought toasted nuts are great as well and we buy them all the time for snacking. Get unsalted ones if possible as they're healthier.<br><br>
Two ways to toast raw nuts:<br><br>
1. Chop raw nuts (optional if using oven).<br><br>
2a. Toast in a dry pan/skil-let over low-medium heat until fragrant, about 10-15 min. Stir frequently to prevent burning. <br><br>
Ideal for small batches when you don't want to fire up the oven.<br><br>
2b. Spread out in a single layer on a dry baking sheet/dish and bake for 5-8 min while oven is preheating, or at 350 F, stirring every 3 min, until fragrant. Be sure to STIR and DO NOT OVER-BAKE*. <br><br>
Great when making large batches or using nuts in baking batters (for ex, banana bread, carrot cake, etc.) bc you'll be using the oven anyway.<br><br>
* Note: Pecans in particular burn easily. I read about this, kept it in mind, and then learned it the hard way when two batches (2 cups worth) burned in one day ;_; <br><br>
I'll experiment with candied nuts one of these days and report back! :D

<br><b>TIP: Ripen bananas quickly</b><br>
Posted by: dumpling (dumpling130)<br><br>
To ripen bananas quickly for baking, smoothies, freezing, etc:<br><br>
1. Place bananas with peels on, on a cookie sheet, line with parchment paper or aluminum foil for easy clean-up (the bananas may ooze liquid)<br><br>
2. Bake at 300 F / 150 C for 30 minutes until the peels turn black.<br><br>
3. Set aside to cool for 30 min before using.<br><br>
That's it!<br><br>
While the bananas are baking, the peels are a bit stinky, but that dissipates quickly afterward. The baked banana is caramelized and absolutely divine :*:* Although they taste sweeter, there is no need to adjust the sugar in a banana bread recipe.<br><br>
The baked bananas will keep in the fridge for 1-2 days (they'll brown but still taste fine and are okay to use), but if you won't use them soon, peel and put them in the freezer.<br><br>
If you don't want to use the oven, you can speed up the natural ripening by pulling the bananas off the stem, then keep them together in a paper bag and/or in a warm, sunny place. The heat helps the sugars break down and release ethylene gas which ripens the fruits. This can take days to weeks, and bananas lovers know it's hard to wait that long! Plus fruit flies can be a problem :K

<br><b>TIP: DIY muffin/cupcake liners</b><br>
Posted by: dumpling (dumpling130)<br><br>
If you're out of muffin/cupcake liners:<br><br>
Cut 5-inch squares (6-in for larger muffins) out of parchment paper. Find a small can or cup that fits in the base of your muffin mold - V8 or tomato paste cans work great. Center the paper square over the base of the can, hold it down with one hand and flatten the paper around the can with the other. Rub the edges of the can to create a crease and pop the liner into the mold. No need to grease them!<br><br>
Using an ice cream scoop helps to keep the paper edges clean, but if they get smeared, just wipe it off before baking. Any baked bits will easily slide off the paper after baking as well, but may leave a light stain ^^b<br><br>
There are ways to fold the squares symmetrically and I recommend searching YooyuTube for tips. Even folded randomly, these liners are very pretty, like the ones you see at bakeries :)<br><br>
You can use aluminum foil in the same way but parchment paper looks nicer.<br><br>
These are not new hacks, but I've been baking for years and never knew them so sharing in case it's useful to someone! ^^v

I made this several times! It's similar to sriracha mayo, but with a sweeter twist from the Thai chili, and of course you can tweak the ratio to your liking.

Posted by: ACe (acexcat13)<br><br>
Recipe ideas for turmeric or tahini?<br>
You bet'cha! :D<br><br>
Turmeric is a key ingredient in most curries, so just about anything 'indian', you'll find a touch of it there. Also, is well-known for being an inflamation fighter.<br><br>
Tahini?<br>
I got one word for you: HUMMUS! B)<br><br>
Can of garbanzo beans, tablespoon of cunim (mipselled, sorry), two tablespoons of yogurt, salt, dash of lemon, olive oil and, of course, a big spoon of tahini.<br><br>
Serve with pita chips and watch it disappear!<br><br>
Hummus is super-flexible, so there's no 'official' recipe. Just drop everything in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth.
DONE.<br><br>
Takes longer to open the can and collect the ingredients than to make it, and is an international favorite.<br><br>
Can also add turmeric &amp; curry if you like.<br>
I add some mustard and a little vinegar to mine.

Posted by: Abbey (magically_delicious)<br><br>
And my moooost favorite recipe is Marshmallow popcorn.<br><br>
Pop a bag of popcorn.<br>
In a saucepan melt together a 2 handfuls of marshmallows with 3 T. butter and 2 T. brown sugar.<br>
Pour the gooey mixture over the popcorn and mix :P<br><br>

Note from dumpling:<br>
I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I highly recommend this combination! Growing up, a family friend used to bring me popcorn that came with a packet of marshmallow sauce and it was just divine ♡ It wasn't available to buy in our area and I never figured out how to make the sauce. Will be trying this for sure.<br><br>

<br><b>Peanut Butter 101</b><br>
Posted by: Nicole (dempson)<br><br>
Delicious easy recipe:<br><br>
Enter the kitchen. Obtain a spoon. The size of the spoon does not matter but I prefer a big one. Discover a jar of peanut butter. Open the jar. Use the spoon to scoop some out. Close the jar and put it away. Run away to sit in a corner and smile while you eat your spoonful of peanut butter.<br><br>

Oh, and my recent fave recipe is for a chai. For 2 servings, 2 cups of water, one cup of milk, and put one stovetop until boiling. Then lower to a simmer and add two tablespoons of chai mix (I LOVE Chai Guys) and let simmer altogether for 3 minutes. Add sweetener of choice, strain, and voila! Enjoy with a biscuit or two  :)♥<br><br>

<br><b>Cinnamon Turmeric Chai</b><br>
Posted by: Sea (seateen)<br><br>
Hey there! I think your recipe/pet posting is such a cute idea!<br>
I really like making this:<br><br>
Cinnamon Tumeric Chai<br><br>
Boil about 3 pints of water on the stove top<br>
Throw in<br>
6 Tablespoons diced fresh tumeric<br>
6 Tablespoons diced fresh ginger<br>
2 cinnamon sticks<br>
2 TB fresh cr.acked peppercorns<br>
6 dried cardamom pods (cr.ack then and throw in the seeds. Discard the pods)<br><br>
After you bring it to a boil, turn it down with a lid on and let simmer for aboit 6 hours. Drain in a mesh colounder or sieve over a large bowl. Discard remnants.<br><br>
Bottle and store in the fridge. When served I like to pour half tea, half milk and serve over ice or hot. It's really good for you too! :) if you store without milk it will last weeks.<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
Q: I just saved a golden milk recipe earlier so I would really like to try this! Black tea? Would turmeric powder work? Not sure what else to use turmeric root for.<br><br>
A: And thank you! I forgot about the actual tea. Lolz<br><br>
Sometimes I add black tea or decaf green tea. Depends on what I'm feeling or if my stomach hurts.<br><br>
I only use Tumeric for tea but I just chop it all up and freeze in in an icecube tray. That way you can grab how much you need. You can use dried but sadly it tends to clump so its not ideal.<br><br>

<br><b>Tea Mix &amp; Fruit Variations</b><br>
Posted by: String (lxy056)<br><br>
I bought a box of green tea bags in costco 3 years ago and sadly half of them sit in my house still T_T<br>
They are like 100 bags per box... Way too much T_T<br><br>
Comments from Dumpling (dumpling130):<br>
Oof yeah, that's... way too much... @@; If it's a regular tea bag for steeping, maybe try mixing it with something else? <br><br>
Green tea goes well with jasmine tea, oolong tea, lemonade, mint, honey,... Google should have some recipe ideas :D<br><br>
If you have matcha powder, try <a href="/~Ikiko0333#1b">baking</a> with it ;)<br><br>
Fruit tea ideas!<br>
My tea loving friend recommended these.<br>
Would be great in the summer :)<br><br>
Cut some apples and put in the green tea, the same way you make flavored water. Passion fruit goes well, too, though it's not readily available in most parts of the US.<br><br>
Peach (fresh fruit or herbal tea) + green tea is a good combination too!<br><br>
Sunkist orange or kiwi should go well, too, though I haven't tried these.<br><br>
Pineapple + green tea is also a good choice. You can also cook the pineapple with sugar to make it softer and sweeter.<br><br>
Comment from Lucia (tooth__fairy):<br>
I LOVE pineapple green/black tea! I think both are good!<br><br>

Posted by: Dumpling (dumpling130)<br><br>
(Look up the photo bc it is gorgeous! *-*)<br><br>
The ingredients list is long, but it's very easy to make, so read on!<br><br>
INGREDIENTS:<br><br>
MIX #1:<br>
* 1 cup flour<br>
* 3/4 c white cornmeal<br>
(SUB: semolina or wheat flour)<br>
* 1 tsp salt<br>
* 1 Tbsp white sesame seeds <br>
(SUB: black / TIP: toast them in a dry pan while prepping!)<br>
* 1 tsp turmeric<br>
* Small pinch of cayenne<br>
* 1 tsp baking powder<br>
* 1 tsp baking soda<br><br>
MIX #2:<br>
* 1 cup buttermilk<br>
(SUB: 1/2 c yogurt + 1/2 c milk (plant or regular) + 1 tsp lemon juice or ACV/white vinegar)<br>
* 2 eggs, beaten<br>
* 1/4 - 1/2 c feta cheese, crumbled in big pieces<br>
(TIP: it melts, OK to add more)<br>
* 1 c grated carrots<br>
(TIP: Add more, TT. 1.25- 1.5-2 cups OK)<br>
* 3/4 c sliced scallions, both white and green parts, plus 2 Tbsp for garnish<br><br>
MIX #3:<br>
* 2 Tbsp butter, plus butter for greasing pan  (SUB: olive oil)<br>
* 1 tsp cu-min seeds<br>
* 1 tsp black mustard seeds<br><br>
TOPPING:<br>
* 1 c crème fraîche<br>
(TIP: not needed / SUB: sour cream or yogurt)<br>
* Cilantro sprigs, for garnish<br>
* 1 tsp black sesame or nigella seeds, for garnish (optional) (TIP: toast them!)<br>
*  Pinch of crushed red pepper, for garnish<br><br>
PREPARATION:<br><br>
1. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 425 F. Lightly butter a 9-inch cake pan.<br><br>
2.<br>
Big bowl: Whisk mix #1: <br>
Flour, cornmeal, salt, white sesame seeds, turmeric, cayenne, baking powder and baking soda.<br><br>
Medium bowl: Whisk mix #2:<br>
Buttermilk, eggs, feta, carrots and scallions.<br><br>
Add #2 to #1 and beat well to make a thick batter. (I used a fork/whisk.)<br><br>
3. Melt butter in a small pan over medium heat. When butter is hot, add cu-min seeds and mustard seeds and cook until fragrant (seeds will begin to pop a bit). Adjust heat so butter does not burn; it's OK if butter browns a little.<br><br>
4. Whisk hot butter mixture (#3) into batter and beat well to combine. Scra-pe batter into prepared cake pan and smooth top with a spatula.<br><br>
5. Bake on the middle rack for 25-30 min or until a skewer / paring knife inserted into the cake comes out clean. Cool in the pan on a rack, then invert onto a plate. (Cake may be baked several hours or up to a day in advance.)<br><br>
6. To finish cake, beat crème fraîche with a fork to loosen, then spread with a metal spatula or knife to coat top and sides. Decorate with cilantro sprigs, scallions, black sesame seeds, crushed red pepper, if desired. Cut into wedges and serve.<br><br>

NOTES from Dumpling (updated May 30, 2021):<br><br>
SESAME seeds: white &amp; black taste the same. Use whatever you have on hand. They're also great tossed on/in muffins, bread, salads, stirfry dishes, etc, so don't be afraid to add them to your pantry.<br><br>
FETA tip: Be sure it's crumbled in big pieces or it'll melt into the batter. I think next time I'll stir it in at the very end, just before pouring into the pan.<br><br>
CARROTS: 1 cup produces a mild carrot cake. If you like the flavor of carrots, add more!<br><br>
SUBS that worked for me: semolina instead of cornmeal, yogurt, plant milk and lemon juice instead of butter milk, oil instead of butter = texture was perfect! FYI, The first few times I made this, I subbed in oat flour for part or all of the flours and the cake turned out a little mushy. (No worries, it's safe to eat!) <br><br>
This was for casual home eating, so we didn't invert it and make it all pretty. We served it with yogurt, scallions and sesame on top. Yum! But you do you and go fancy if you like :D

<br><b>Cassava Cheese Bread</b><br>
Credit: Laylita's Recipes<br>
Posted by: dumpling (dumpling130)<br><br>
Following Emily's suggestion (<a href="#27a">TIP: Casava / yuca</a>), we got some tapioka flour and made cassava cheese bread over the holidays.<br><br>
It's easy to make by hand and delicious! Fresh out of the oven, it's crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. Once it cools down, it firms up. (Do not overbake, it may be a bit hard.) I recommend serving immediately or reheating before serving for extra cheesy goodness, but others in my family loved it cold. It goes very well with yogurt or a yogurt drink, as it is often paired in Ecuador.<br><br>
Do check out the original recipe website for tips and variations. Note that it's not so much flour with cheese as cheese with flour :P (we used a whole 16 oz bag of shredded mozzarella!) (Get part skim moz and the bread will be low-fat as well as low-carb.)<br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/0hcol3d35t71ir1/PandeYuca-1.JPG" width="200">~<img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/8x0lbb5kbw7hwsp/PandeYuca-2.JPG" height="150"><br><i><font size="2">(To view full pic, drag and drop the image into your browser's address line or right click and open image in a new tab.)</font></i><br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br><b>Pan de yuca / cheese bread</b><br>
Credit: Laylita's Recipe<br>
Total Time: 25 min<br>
Servings: 20-25 small yuca breads<br><br>
INGREDIENTS<br><br>
2 1/2 cups yuca or cassava starch - sometimes also called yuca flour or tapioca starch/flour<br>
4 cups grated mozzarella cheese can also use half mozzarella &amp; half queso fresco or quesillo<br>
1 tsp baking powder<br>
Pinch of salt<br>
1 stick of butter 4 oz or 113 grams, room temperature, cut into 8 pieces<br>
2 large eggs<br>
2-4 tablespoons of water or milk, add more if the dough is dry<br><br>
INSTRUCTIONS<br><br>
1. Combine the yuca starch or flour, cheese, baking powder and salt in a food processor, blend to mix well.<br><br>
2. Add the butter and eggs.<br><br>
3. Mix until small dough ba-lls begin to form, if it's too dry add 1-2 tablespoons of water or milk. Add more if needed.<br><br>
4. Remove the dough from the food processor and roll into a ball, you can make the dough ahead and store in the refrigerator for up to a day.<br><br>
5. To make the dough by hand, combine all the ingredients in large bowl, using melted (cooled down) butter, and mix until you have a smooth dough. It's actually very easy to prepare by hand.<br><br>
6. Pre-heat the oven to 500 F.<br><br>
7. Make small round shaped breads with the dough and place on a cookie sheet with parchment paper.<br><br>
8. Bake immediately or store in the fridge until ready to bake. I find that they turn out best if you do let them chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes before baking.<br><br>
9. Once the oven reaches 500F, turn on broiler, place the breads on the middle rack and bake until the breads are golden, about 5-7 minutes. Another option is to pre-heat the oven to 400F and bake at 400F for about 5 minutes and then turn on the broiler.<br><br>
10. Serve immediately, can be served alone or with tree tomato aji.<br><br>

<br><b>Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeno Popper</b><br>
Posted by: Ava (sequim_03_wolf)<br><br>
I have a bacon-wrapped jalapeno popper recipe I made up. The problem is I didn't measure my ingredients, so it's all to taste. Can also make it w/o the bacon if you don't eat meat.<br><br>
You need:<br>
1. Fresh jalapenos, cut into halves, leaving seeds in are optional (I don't because I'm a wuss).<br>
2. Hickory or applewood sm0ked bacon.<br>
3. Aged cheddar (or sharp cheddar if you can't find aged). Grated small.<br>
4. A brick (or two depending on how many you're making) of cream cheese (Philadelphia)<br>
5. Kinder's Woodfired garlic seasoning<br>
6. Toothpicks (if wrapping in bacon)<br><br>
I mix the finely grated aged cheddar (can also use sm0ked gouda too!), cream cheese, and woodfired garlic seasoning together for the filling.<br><br>
Cut the jalapenos in half, put as much filling as you'd like in them. Wrap in bacon, use toothpick to hold bacon together.<br><br>
Bake until bacon is cooked and they look done.<br><br>
It's a spicy, sm0key taste. :P<br><br>

<br><b>Mediterranean Quinoa Salad</b><br>

Posted by: Dumpling (dumpling130)<br><br>
I love this simple, quick, healthy recipe! It's pretty similar to ljc's recipe above. I usually combine the two, with whatever veggies I have on hand. If using kale, be sure to scrunch it up like you're crumpling a piece of paper. This makes it softer and tastier. Also don't skip the lemon juice, which balances out the kale's bitterness. Enjoy!<br><br>
Ingredients:<br>
* 1 cup cooked quinoa<br>
* 3 cloves minced garlic<br>
* 1/4 cup chopped parsley<br>
* 1/4 cup crumbled feta (TT)<br>
* 2 Tbsp red wine vinegar (SUB: balsamic vinegar)<br>
* 2 Tbsp olive oil<br>
* 10-15 quartered cherry tomatoes<br>
* 1 lemon, squeezed for fresh juice (NOTE: start with half, adjust TT)<br>
* Handful of chopped kale (SUB: arugula, spinach)<br>
* Salt, pepper, and chili flakes to season<br><br>
This one's easy! Toss all of the ingredients together in a big bowl; taste to make sure the lemon juice, salt and pepper, and spice levels are okay. Season if needed, and enjoy! P.S. This one's even better as leftovers, so don't hesitate to make a big batch. <br><br>

<div class="box"><br><b>Lemon Garlic Sauteed Cabbage</b><br>
Credit: Inspired Taste<br><br>
* PREP: 5 mins<br>
* COOK: 15 mins<br>
* TOTAL: 20 mins<br><br>This easy, healthy recipe for sauteed cabbage is delicious. As the cabbage cooks in the pan, it wilts, turns tender, and becomes sweet. Cabbage may sound like a boring side, but this is one of our favorite side dishes to make. White cabbage is our favorite for this, but other cabbage varieties will work. Keep in mind, though, that Napa cabbage will release more moisture and won't brown as nicely in the pan.<br><br>
Makes 4 servings<br><br>
INGREDIENTS<br>
* 2 pounds white cabbage, core removed and shredded (10 cups)<br>
* 1 1/2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br>
* 1 Tbsp garlic, minced<br>
* Pinch crushed red pepper flakes<br>
* 1/2 tsp fine sea salt or more TT<br>
* Half of a lemon, cut into wedges<br><br>
DIRECTIONS<br>
1. Heat the olive oil in a large ski-llet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the cabbage, garlic, red pepper flakes, and the salt. It might seem like too much cabbage for the pan, but as it cooks, the cabbage will wilt down.<br><br>
2. Cook, stirring occasionally until the cabbage is tender and some of the cabbage begins to turn a light brown; 10 to 15 minutes.<br><br>
3. Squeeze the juice from 2 lemon wedges over the cabbage. Taste then adjust with more salt, pepper, and lemon juice as needed.<br><br>
TIPS:<br>
* To shred the cabbage, quarter the cabbage through the core, and then cut out the core. Cut each quarter crosswise in half and finely shred. Rinse and spin or pat very dry.<br>
* This recipe is excellent with onions_ add them to the pan at the same time as the cabbage<br><br>
MY NOTES:<br>
This is super fast. Wonderfully tangy and savory. It's fantastic on a slice of toast or straight out of the bowl :)<br><br>
NOTE: This whole recipe is to taste, so don't worry about measurements and adjust as you go. We used 1 head of cabbage, 6 cloves of garlic (diced/pressed), salt/pepper, and juice from 1/2 - 1 lemon. This yielded 2 servings.<br><br>
Make sure to cook the cabbage all the way. We were hungry and rushed it a bit the 2nd time haha Cabbage is slightly bitter when raw and sweet when cooked. In a frypan, it caramelizes a bit. When it's ready, it'll taste sweet, and tangy from the lemon. If it's still crunchy and a bit bitter, cook it a few more minutes.<br><br>
DIRECTIONS (short version):<br><br>
Heat a pan with some olive oil.<br><br>
Chop/shred a head of cabbage, put it in the pan.<br><br>
Mince/press 3-6 cloves garlic, put them in.<br><br>
Add salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes (optional).<br><br>
Let it cook down, stirring occasionally.<br><br>
Add the lemon juice just before taking off the heat.<br><br>
Enjoy!

<br><b>Carrot Fries</b><br>
Posted by: Lauren (coconut_rat)<br><br>
I love making carrot fries! It's simple - slice your carrots, soak/coat in a mixture of olive oil, pepper, salt, and paprika and put it in the oven until crispy. Other people like a few more things on there so play around~<br><br>
Q: They don't get mushy??<br><br>
They don't! Well, they're a little mushy on the inside but if you get the oven temp right it crisps the outside and has a similar texture to home fries. Carrot gets pretty sweet when its cooked too so it's very nice<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
Comments from dumpling (July 28, 2021)<br>
Oven baked potato &amp; carrot fries were a success! 450 F is def better for our oven. Potatoes were done in 25-30 min, flipping halfway. The carrots cook faster so 20-25 min, flipping halfway, should be good. We burned the carrots a little bit they were still tasty :) Dipping sauce: plain yogurt, lemon juice, chopped chives or scallions, salt &amp; pepper (mix TT). Thanks for the idea, Lauren!<br><br>

<br><b>TIPS: Mashed Potatoes</b><br>
Posted by: Linnea (linneamful)<br><br>
For food-related tips, this one may be really silly, but a friend from work and I just had this conversation. If you have a stand mixer, use it to make your mashed potatoes instead of hand mashing!<br><br>
(Idk if this is a well-known thing or not, but it blew her mind, so...)<br><br>
Dumpling:<br>
That food tip kinda blew my mind, too *lol* I never thought of that!<br><br>
Linnea:<br>
... And *lol* I grew up watching my mom do it, so I never realized it was something people didn't think of! They get so creamy and perfect! (And now I really want mashed potatoes.)<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
Tip from Dumpling:<br>
I'll throw in another mash tip bc this was new to me xD My friend adds a little cream to his mash, which makes it extra smooth and rich. He also mashes in boiled eggs and the yolks add even more creaminess and color, while the whites add a nice texture. Sounds like a weird combo at first, but it works!<br><br>
Linnea:<br>
Oooh! I knew about the cream tip (we do that as well), but I can't imagine the eggs... I don't like boiled eggs at all, though, so that's probably not surprising. *lol*<br><br>
Dumpling:<br>
I looove boiled eggs. But yeah, I get it, to each their own (:<br><br>
When I was little, my grandfather would often decorate my mash. He would cut slices of tomato, cucu-mber, carrots, etc, in curvy and zigzag patterns, and arrange them so they look like a face. It was so much fun x) Had to watch out for the peppercorns, though :P

Egg salad is an easy recipe, and so tasty.<br><br>
You need:<br>
Eggs (I usually do 18)<br>
Mayonnaise<br>
Sweet pickle relish<br><br>
Boil the eggs about 10 minutes, cool, and peel. Finely chop or mash the eggs until they're like little crumbles. Add mayo and relish a spoonful at a time until it's how you like it. Salt to taste, and you're done.<br>
Optional: mustard, lemon juice, chives, celery, paprika.<br><br>
Yeah, 18 is a lot more than most people do I think. My family gets ravenous over egg salad so I have to make a lot, haha. Most recipes call for 8-10, I believe.

<div class="box"><br><b>Chilled Spinach Avocado Soup</b><br>
Credit: Blogilates<br><br>
Yield: 1 serving<br>
Serving Size: 1 jar<br>
Prep Time: 5 min<br><br>
Method:<br>
* Soak raw cashews for 6 hours or overnight.<br>
* Rinse drained cashews.<br>
* Place everything but tomato into a high-powered blender and process until smooth. Top with tomato, and serve chilled.<br><br>
Ingredients:<br>
* 3 Tbsp raw cashews, soaked 6 hours and drained<br>
* 2 big handfuls spinach<br>
* 3/4 cup vegetable broth<br>
* 1 mini Persian cucu-mber, sliced<br>
* 1 celery stalk, sliced<br>
* 1/4 cup avocado<br>
* 2 whole green onions_   sliced<br>
* 1/4 cup basil leaves (optional)<br>
* 2 Tbsp nutritional yeast<br>
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder<br>
* 1/4 tsp sea salt<br>
* Pinch of pepper<br>
* 1/2 tomato, chopped<br><br>
NOTES:<br><br>
For the veggie broth, I used 3/4 cup warm water with 1 tsp of Trader Joe's vegan chicken-less seasoning salt (so tasty, and MSG-free!), but powdered chicken stock / bouillon will work as well. Normal cucu is fine. If you don't have green onions_  1/4 the amount in regular onion works as well (but it has a much sharper taste, so don't use too much!)<br><br>
This soup is surprisingly rich and filling! It makes a great side dish with multi-grain cra-ckers or thin slice of toast. We made a double portion, which yielded about 4-5 cups of soup.<br><br>
Nutritional yeast is often combined with cashews to make vegan cheese. You can also sprinkle nutritional yeast on salads, soups, popcorn, whatever you like :) If you can't find nutritional yeast or don't want to buy it just for this, try subbing in parmesan cheese.

<div class="box"><br><b>Stuffed Pepper Soup</b><br>
Posted by: Raven (nightraven2000)<br><br>
and to keep with the spirit of the board. I do have a recipe for stuffed pepper soup that can just be thrown in a slow cooker (only the rice gets added last an hour before cooking)<br><br>
The things you need<br>
-1lb ground beef<br>
-lrg onion chopped<br>
-3 bell peppers diced<br>
-1 can of diced tomatoes (14.5 OZ approx)<br>
-1 can of tomato sauce (14.5 Oz approx)<br>
-1 tsp dried oregano<br>
-1 tsp dried basil<br>
-1/2 tsp of salt<br>
-1/4 tsp of pepper<br>
-1 box of chicken stock (32 oz approx)<br>
-2 cups of water<br>
-2 tbsp powdered beef stock<br>
-1-2 cups of uncooked rice (depends on how much rice you want)<br><br>
Throw everything (except the rice) into your slow cooker, If you start cooking it in the morning you can turn it on low but I've done this 4 hours prior to dinner on high with no problems. An hour before you start serving you can add the rice and it should be done by the time you're ready to eat. The recipe is pretty forgiving if your a bit over or under with some ingredients.<br><br>
With this recipe I was able to serve 4 people with everyone getting seconds, it also gets devoured by my family with very little for leftovers lol.<br><br>
I also prefer not using green peppers just for aesthetic but it's up to you and what you have on hand.<br><br>
I'm not the best at cooking so it should be nice and easy for people who aren't as well lol.

Add the heavy cream and sausage and stir<br><br>
Once the heavy cream has been heated in the pot, you can add the diced spinach immediately before serving (I like it best when it's not SUPER cooked down as it tastes very fresh).<br><br>
Sorry if my instructions are hard to understand...very easy to make, makes a lot, reheats very good, freezes good, and is easy to up the recipe to feed more people!

<br><b>Chicken Noodle Soup</b><br>
Posted by: Nico (bluepoogle_1996)<br><br>
As for a fav recipe? I love my fav chicken noodle soup recipe, it is a sorta oral/just wing it recipe tho. *lol*<br><br>
I use like a big stock pot, its like 3 boxed things of broth/stock. four-ish cups of water. i make a cup of broth w/ some chicken bullion. and put about another tablespoon of bullion into the pot w/ everything else.<br><br>
get fresh carrots/celery/onions, chop em up and go by how much i need/want.<br><br>
spices: salt, pepper, oregano, and majoram.<br><br>
I tend to buy a precooked rotisserie chicken, if it's cold, i put it in a strainer and into the broth and let it sit for like an hour. but if its warm, i'll peel like the white meat off and stick the remainder in the pot for again like an hour.
i pull the chicken meat apart, and have it off to the side w/ everything else.<br><br>
combine it all in the pot, add the spices. i let it sit b4 adding the noodles into the mix. I use these lil bead sized ones. Acini di pepe or smthng. but you can use tortellini, egg noodles, or what have u. and boom..... soup

<br><b>Hot and Sour Soup</b><br>
Posted by: Coira (coira_)<br><br>
I have a newish recipe that I make once a month to make about a gallon of hot and sour soup to then portion and freeze. Measurements may seem intimidating, but the amount of soup I make lasts me an entire month. =o Would anyone be interested?<br><br>
(Yes!)<br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Juyia">//www.neopets.com/~Juyia</a><br><br>
It's a bit of a long one, but I promise it is mostly just sitting around and waiting after all the prep is done.<br><br>
Hot and Sour Soup<br><br>
Ingredients:<br>
1.5-2 lbs mushroom of your choosing (traditional is shi.ttake, but I use button because they're cheaper.)<br>
1 lbs bok choy or baby bok choy<br>
1 head of garlic<br>
1 knob of ginger (enough that when diced you have about 3 tbsp or almost 1:1 garlic to ginger ratio)<br>
Green onion_<br>
A stock of your choosing (or bullion cubes)<br>
A splash of olive oil<br>
Sugar (brown or granulated, doesn't matter)<br>
Soy sauce<br>
Rice vinegar<br>
Asian spice paste (or sriracha if you can't find + paprika)<br>
Corn starch<br><br>
This is the most time consuming part. You'll want to slice up your mushrooms and put them in a colander. I suggest putting on a podcast and settling in, it takes a while. Set aside.<br><br>
Remove the stems on your bok choy, and dice into bite sized pieces, set aside.<br><br>
Slice the green onions and set aside.<br><br>
Mince the garlic and the ginger as fine as you'd like.<br><br>
Heat the biggest pot you own (I use my pasta pot) with a splash of olive oil on medium heat, add the garlic and ginger and gently cook until fragrant, just a couple of minutes.<br><br>
I own a gallon (16 cup) pot, so this took a bit of fine tuning. When your garlic and ginger are fragrant, I add 12 cups of stock of whatever I have on hand, mixing vegetable/beef/chicken doesn't matter, because it won't be your primary flavour. Resist the urge to salt it at all costs. Turn up the heat and bring to a boil, if using bullion let boil for about 10 minutes so that things are really melted and well incorporated.<br><br>
This is when I add about 5 tbsp of the sugar of my choosing, 2/3 a cup of soy sauce, and slightly less than 3/4 a cup of rice vinegar. Wait for it to boil again and taste it, if you can't taste a hint of sweetness, add another tbsp of sugar. If you can't really taste any salt, add another tbsp of soy sauce. If you can't really taste the bite, add another tbsp of rice vinegar. If you're nervous, always feel free to start with smaller amounts because you can always add, but you can't take away. This is also why I don't salt it, the salt from the stock and the soy sauce should do it all for you.<br><br>
While this is boiling for a moment or two, wash the mushrooms, don't be afraid to really get in there and give them a thorough soaking, everyone says not to, but they're going into a giant tub of water, anyway. Add them and lower the heat back to medium, or medium low. You want it to simmer, but not boil.
Now is when you just sit around for another 10 minutes or so, or really however long you want if you have other things to do, or just want to sit down. You've earned it. Stir occasionally.<br><br>
After you think you've simmered your mushrooms for long enough, also at this point, feel free to scoop a small portion of mushrooms out, sans broth for a mushroom snack. You're the cook, you make the rules. It is time to rinse the bok choy, and add it to the broth. Continue to simmer until the greens of the bok choy wilt down and stir occasionally.<br><br>
Now comes the tricky bit, because it comes down to taste. I use about 3 tbsp sriacha to 2 tbsp paprika mixed together to form a paste to make an asian spice paste equivelant, and that is about how spicy I like it, or you can add 3 tbsp asian spice paste. This comes to taste, start small, taste, add more until it is as spicy as you would like it. Make sure you stir well to ensure everything is incorporated.<br><br>
Continue to simmer just a short while longer, or however long you'd like, this is one of those things where timing isn't crucial. When you're ready to eat it, make a cornstarch slurry by adding 3 tbsp corn starch to 6 tbsp water, this won't thicken the broth significantly, but it does change the mouth feel. Add it.<br><br>
Finish with green onions_<br><br>
What I like about this soup the most is that you can add whatever you like to it upon reheating, or let it stand alone. I like to add leftover chicken and rice, or whatever cooked vegetables I have. Feel free to 1/4 the recipe, I have honestly forgotten the original measurements, and only remember my batch cooking measurements.<br><br>

<div class="box"><br><b>TIP: Bell Peppers</b><br>
Fun fact: The color of a regular bell pepper is simply a reflection of how ripe it is, how much time it spent in the sun. Red bell peppers are ripened green peppers. As they ripen, the nutrition and flavor profile changes.<br><br>
Red bell peppers are generally sweeter, and even more so after cooking. These are a great introduction for kids who don't like veggies. Roast some on a grill or in the oven until they're wrinkly with charred spots, peel them and sprinkle some salt. It's great on toast or in a sandwich, as well as a dip for cra-ckers. Add some light vinegar if you want it tangy.<br><br>
Btw I speak from experience ^^; I finally learned to eat bell peppers this way just a few years ago. Now Raw peppers w/ hummus is one of my favorite snacks now :D<br><br>
Another fun fact: Bell peppers are packed with Vitamin C! Great alternative to tomatoes or citrus if your stomach is sensitive.<br><br>
In the fruit category, Kiwis are also high in Vitamin C and are even milder on the tangy level. Look for golden kiwis around September, they're a bit sweeter than the green ones.

<br><b>TIP: Casava / yuca</b><br>
Posted by: Millie (Emily) (memi_1996)<br><br>
Also, food tips? Add cassava dishes to your diet. It's way underrated! (I even consider it better than potatoes or sweet potatoes *cough*).<br><br>
(How do you cook it?)<br>
Honestly? Boil it...a lot before preparing anything with it...or you'll lose a tooth or two lol (I think that's the reason it's so unpopular).<br><br>
Yes! Fried cassava is amazing!<br><br>
I do know of a couple soups/stews/broths with it. If you are feeling adventurous for global delicacies I recommend Ecuadorian dishes (encebollado, tortilla de yuca, caldo de bola, muchines are a few) :)<br><br>
My favorite dish of all times: Encebollado (nothing screams Ecuadorian Coastal Region more than this dish). I personally like to eat it with toasted corn, fried plantain chips, bread and lime juice. I prefer it without mustard or ketchup :')<br><br>
Encebollado is one of those dishes that you can enjoy as breakfast, lunch or dinner. I eat it at least three times per month.<br><br>
If you're vegetarian/vegan or can't eat fish you could switch the albacore with mushrooms I think ^-^<br><br>
Oh, I also forgot about cassava cheese bread :) very, very tasty snack<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
Quick notes from dumpling:<br><br>
Encebollado = fish, cassava &amp; onion stew, a national dish in Ecuador<br><br>
Tortilla de yuca = tortillas made of yuca (filled with cheese/chicken/ground beef)<br><br>
Caldo de bola = stuffed plantain dumpling soup<br><br>
Muchines = cassava ba11s with crunch shell &amp; soft, savory filling<br><br>
Cassava cheese bread = cheese-stuffed bread made of yuca<br>
(See <a href="#32h">Cassava Cheese Bread <img src="http://i.imgur.com/DT7pYga.png"></a>)<br><br>
Poogle them and try not to drool :3

Posted by: Carrie (codestonees)<br><br>
My favourite spicy black bean burgers go as follows:<br><br>
-2 cans of black beans, patted dry and placed in oven for 6 min at 150 C<br><br>
-Saute one whole onion_  finely chopped, and garlic in olive oil until transparent<br><br>
-Add onions and garlic to bowl, then mix together with 3/4 cup bread crumbs<br><br>
-mix with bread crumbs, 1 tablespoons of chili powder (I like things spicier), 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1 1/2 teaspoons c-u-m-i-n, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon chili flakes, 2 large eggs, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce, 1/4 cup BBQ sauce, salt and pepper to taste.<br><br>
- Once mixed, add beans and then mash together with fork leaving some bean chunks.<br><br>
-with wet hands, form roughly 1/3 cup of mixture into patties and place on parchment paper<br><br>
-Place in fridge for an hour<br><br>
Remove from fridge, and fan bake for 15-20 minutes each side on 200 C. Or grill, but I haven't tried that yet.<br><br>
Top as you would a normal burger. :D<br><br>
This is a pretty easy one. I'm cooking inept and found these a breeze.

a large handful of fresh sage, <br>
1/4 cup raw cashews, <br>
1/2 cup veggie broth, <br>
1/2 tsp lemon juice, <br>
1/4 cup vegan parmesan cheese.<br><br>
INSTRUCTIONS:<br>
1. Soak cashews in very hot water.<br>
2. Start boiling water; whenever the water is ready, cook ravioli according to package directions.<br>
3. Mince sage.<br>
4. Begin melting stick of butter in a sk1llet set to medium heat, stirring often until the butter starts to foam. While waiting for butter to foam, blend soaked cashews in a high-powered blender, adding soy milk as necessary to get a consistency similar to heavy whipping cream. Once the butter starts to foam, add minced sage.<br>
5. Continue swirling the butter until golden brown flecks begin to appear - keep stirring until it smells nutty and has plenty of golden flecks. Remove from heat.<br>
6. Add vegetable broth, cashew cream, lemon juice, and vegan parmesan to the browned butter, stirring until completely incorporated. Add salt and pepper to taste.<br>
7. Stir ravioli into the sauce until evenly coated and enjoy!

Something I do that's quick and easy for dinner is you make a box of mac and cheese, add a thing of velveeta, then add leftover meat from the night before. Like I've used chicken, shrimp, bbq ribs (so good!), taco meat. You chop up the meat so it's bite sized then just mix in it with the mac and it's good to go! You could also put it in a casserole dish and sprinkle shredded cheese and bread crumbs on top and put in the oven for like 10-15 minutes for a little more razzle dazzle *lol*<br><br>

<br><b>Vegan Mac n Cheese</b><br>
Credit: Tá Na Mesa Vegg (pt/br)<br>
Posted by: Thais (snorlaxa)<br><br>
I just made the vegan mac n cheese and it's amazing! TwT<br>
Even my dad liked it and ate twice (he had already had lunch) 0:-) <br><br>
The recipe is in a yt portuguese video so I have to write and translate it first, but once I'm done, I'll post it here ^^<br><br>
Yaaaay I finally finnished it! xD<br>
The recipe got a bit longer, so I put it here (petpage).<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><i>Recipe copied over from PP above just in case.<br>
Full credit to Thais!<br></i>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
Ingredients:<br><br>
1 pound pasta<br><br>
Cheese sauce:<br>
1 cup Brazil nut + almond (I used cashews)<br>
2 cups boiling water - to soak (I soaked it overnight instead)<br>
500-600ml boiling water - to mix<br>
1 small onion_<br>
2 tbsp oil<br>
1 tbsp wheat flour<br>
1 tsp salt<br>
Nutmeg to taste<br>
Turmeric to taste<br>
1 tbsp nutritional yeast (I used 2 because why not)<br><br>
Braised broccoli (optional): (I personally like it and think it fits very well)<br>
3 tbsp olive oil<br>
3 garlic cloves<br>
1 bunch of broccoli<br>
Black pepper to taste<br>
1 tsp salt<br><br>
Instructions:<br><br>
1. Plant milk: Soak the nuts in 2 cups of hot water for 30 minutes. Wash, add the 500-600ml of boiling water and blend. Sieve and reserve.<br><br>
2. Cheese sauce: Grate the onion_ Put 2 tbsp olive oil in a pan, add the grated onion for ~4min, add the 1 tbsp wheat flour and braise for more ~4min until it tuns into a lil dough.<br><br>
Then, gradually add the milk while whipping with a wire whip. Don't stop whiping until you add all the milk, so it won't lump. Now, add 1 tsp salt, nutmeg to taste, turmeric to taste (it gives the vibrant yellow color), nutritional yeast to taste (this one gives the cheese flavour, it's super important!), black pepper to taste, (I also added some garlic powder).<br><br>
3. Braised broccoli (optional): Add 3 tbsp olive oil in a pan, 3 chopped garlic cloves and braise for ~2min. Add the chopped broccoli, pepper, salt and braise for ~5min. (I let it get that golden crust so I braise for a few more minutes than that).<br><br>
4. Now, mix the cooked pasta with the cheese sauce and top with the braised broccoli and tcharam! ^-^<br><br><br>
Side note 1: Don't throw the nuts residue of the plant milk away! It goes really well with some spices – I usually use salt, black pepper, olive oil, garlic powder, sometimes nutritional yeast, some herbs like oregano and rosemary. I like to pass it on my bread/toast.<br><br>
Side note 2: You can use any plant milk of your choice, but a neutral one would go better.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2VaUZ20.jpg" width="200"><br><i><font size="2">(To view full pic, drag and drop the image into your browser's address line or right click and open image in a new tab.)</font></i><br><br>

Notes from Dumpling (dumpling130) (Jun 2021)<br><br>
Thais, we made the Vegan Mac &amp; Cheese for dinner tonight! We didn't have broccoli and needed to use a bunch of zucchini, so we made sauteed zucchini noodles instead of pasta. It was really good - light, flavorful, healthy :D<br><br>
I think I made a couple of small mistake, but that's on me. (1) I probably added a little too much water (600+ ml), so the sauce was thick, but not like gooey cheese thick. It worked really well with the noodles, but for pasta/macaroni, thicker may be better. (2) I blended it too long and there was no nut residue! I want to try the pulp on toast, so I'll blend a little less next time haha<br><br>
Next time I'll try adding a little smoked paprika. I feel like the rich peppery taste will go well, and add color, but I could be totally wrong :P I'll let you know :)<br><br>

You can make a really amazing pasta sauce with chicken stock, parm cheese, sour cream, and lemon. If you have additional seasoning, great toss some garlic in the pan first for 30 seconds to get fragrant. I started making this sauce when I forgot heavy cream at the store. It has more of a bite in flavor than normal Alfredo, but its so good.<br><br>

Cheesy Potato Casserole!<br><br>
Thaw 2 lb. frozen hash browns (a half hour or so in the bag or out)<br><br>
Heat 1 can cream of chicken soup (Undiluted) with 1 stick of butter until the butter is melted<br><br>
add 8 oz. sour cream and 1 2/3 cups grated cheddar cheese to the cream of chicken soup mixture and fold in 1 cup chopped green onions_<br><br>
Add the hash browns and mix well, salting to taste, (around 1 1/2 tsp salt)<br><br>
---transfer the hash brown mixture from the pot to a casserole dish----<br><br>
Top with 1 1/2 cups more grated cheddar cheese and bake uncovered for 60 minutes at 325 degrees!<br><br>
It's done when its starting to brown around the edges!<br><br>
Its simple easy and delicious! Add this as a side dish to your meal or indulge in it as a main dish!<br><br>
Question: This should work with freshly grated potatoes too, right?<br><br>
Robin: Yeah ofc! Either or works! I did mean hash browns as in the bag already frozen and shredded thought if that clarifies anything!<br><br>
You could also use mushroom soup instead of the chicken soup if that is a flavor you would rather have!<br><br>
Comment: ... I think we may try to substitute the onions for green beans (I'm allergic to onions anyways) ...<br><br>
Robin: I honestly am picky with how I eat my onions so I left it out of the recipe all together and it was still good! I bet it would be real good with green beans instead anyways! If you weren't allergic to onions I would have suggested onion powder instead but thats okay! Maybe you can do some garlic powder instead?

Posted by: Bee (a_cockatiel_a)<br><br>
While I'm here, I'll also share my family's chicken casserole recipe!<br><br>
Ingredients: 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, chicken broth, stuffing crumbs, 2 sticks of butter, and of course grilled chicken! Whatever kind of chicken you'd like can be used, from canned to straight off the bone, but we typically use rotisserie. Make sure the chicken is cooked before you start!<br><br>
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees<br>
2. Put butter into an oven safe casserole dish and melt it in the oven<br>
3. While the butter is melting, mix the stuffing mix in a large bowl with the cream of chicken and cream of mushroom. Make sure you keep an eye on the butter so it doesn't burn!<br>
4. Pour some of your broth in and then add the chicken. Mix it all up! Broth should be added to taste, depending on how moist you want it to be. We usually end up using about a can and a half.<br>
5. Remove the casserole dish and spread out your mixture into it.<br>
6. Bake for about 45 minutes or until done!<br><br>
It's a really simple recipe but I like it a lot!! You can replace the cream of mushroom with another chicken soup if you don't like mushrooms, too. It won't make a difference in anything besides texture and flavor.

<div class="box"><br><b>Southern Homestyle Chicken Pot Pie</b><br>
Posted by: Trikxty (trikxty_trikxtress)<br><br>
Incoming AMAZING, easy soul food; recipe straight from a Southern American grandmother! :D<br><br>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.<br><br>
Drain 1 lb, size (16 oz.) veg-all, any other mixed vegetable variety you may choose (potatoes, carrots, corn, green beans, garden peas)<br><br>
Add to that 1 can cream of chicken or cream of mushroom.<br><br>
Mix ingredients together in bowl.<br><br>
(In the above, not incl in HER recipe, I add pepper, parsley, celery, and onion flakes; optional but adds so much complimentary flavor!)<br><br>
Sautee 1 small onion in 2 tablespoons in melted margarine (optional) or you can use 1/8 cup of minced dried onion softened in water (or onion flakes, depending on how strong you want the onion_ .<br><br>
Add 2 cups cubed, shredded, or chunked precooked chicken.<br><br>
Use a double pie crust. (I use the pillsbury pie crust that comes in a box in the dairy department. It has 2 crusts.)<br><br>
Put one on the bottom of the pan, add mixture, then put other crust on top of that.<br><br>
(OPTIONAL: To make the pie cook and "seal", line the edges of the crust with water or egg wash with your finger, where the top and bottom crust connect. I also vent the crust with.....<br><br>
....a fork, making cute patterns like you would see on a traditional pie; totally optional, but venting DOES help the mixture cook thoroughly.)<br><br>
Cook 45 minutes or so until crust is brown on top.<br><br>
Let SIT for 30 in a cool-ish area so the mixture solidifies, otherwise, the crust can fall apart and the pie might be a bit mushy.<br><br>
I make 2 of these every time and have WONDERFUL leftovers for DAYS.<br><br>
Also, I DO use an eggwash over the crust to make it extra crispy, but not the burnt kind of crispy. It adds something different to it that makes it wonderful.<br><br>
Oh and just to add, I'm literally about to make this right now, but I'm making it as a casserole. I'm putting the mixture in a large casserole dish and lining the top with buttered biscuits (the American kind). This is also optional if you don't want to mess with the crust! Just take the biscuit and cut it into 1/4's and ball them up across the top. It's so yummy! :* *drools*<br><br>
Don't let the pie crust intimidate you. It's not difficult at ALL. I was so surprised how easy it was when I first asked my grandmother for her recipe (I live 2hrs away in another state, so I can't go get her cooking any time I want. *lol*)<br><br>
Enjoy! I can't wait to eat this! It smells SO good. *heart*<br><br>
I'm just using biscuits today instead of pie crust because there was a sale on biscuits and I have a LOT of buttered biscuits.<br><br>
Oh and one more fyi, if you're going to use biscuits as a casserole, brush the biscuits with egg wash and cook for 20-25 mins, otherwise you can burn the biscuits. That's kind of important.

<div class="box"><br><b>Parmesan Chicken Fingers</b><br>
Posted by: Coira (coira_)<br><br>
Depending on how big of a batch you want to make, two large chicken chest makes about 10, but you can make as many or as few as you want, as they freeze and reheat well. I personally like to batch cook for days when I want to do very little. :P<br><br>
All you need is:<br>
Italian breadcrumbs (I'll type out substitutes after)<br>
Cheap parmesean shake cheese<br>
Chicken chest<br>
A couple of tbs of butter or 1-2 eggs<br><br>
For substitutes for the breadcrumbs, you can use panko or crushed cornflakes, you just have to salt them with a little bit of garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and salt to taste.<br><br>
You can also use fancy parmesan if you really want, I just personally find it not worth the effort to crumble it small enough so it mixes well with the breadcrumbs.<br><br>
I also personally use butter because I find it sticks just as well as the traditional flour/egg wash/flour/crumbs, and I really don't like buying eggs just to batter things. Anyway, onto the recipe!<br><br>
Take your chicken chest and cut it into roughly even strips. Personally I find this easiest if you flip it over and find the little kind of seam all boneless chests have. If you cut off that little flap you sort of have a guide for how big you want your pieces to be, but it doesn't matter if some are longer or shorter than others, what matters is the thickness, because that will affect cook time.<br><br>
Set aside your pieces and start getting your two coatings ready.<br><br>
In a bowl, mix 3/4 cup of italian breadcrumbs/substitute with 3/4 cup of the parm of your choice, it doesn't matter too much as long as the crumbs and parm integrate nicely.<br><br>
In a separate bowl melt your butter in 20 second intervals in the microwave, or alternatively whisk 1 egg.<br><br>
Then it's time to start dunking your chicken.<br><br>
Line a baking sheet with tin foil to put your freshly dunked chicken on, and start preheating your oven to 325F.<br><br>
I personally use the wet hand, dry hand method to try to minimize the mess, but it also helps to have a wet wipe handy so you don't raw chicken your entire kitchen just trying to wash your gooey chicken hands. :P<br><br>
Dunk your chicken into your melted butter/whisked egg and flip it around to make sure it gets coated, then drop it in your crumb mixture. Using your other hand flip it around until it gets an even coating. Don't worry if the coating seems thin, just make sure it's coated on all sides, trust me. Then take it out of your crumb mixture and put it on your lined baking pan.<br><br>
Once all your chicken fingers are in a singe, even layer on your lined baking sheet, place them in your preheated 325F oven for 15-20 minutes. Take them out and flip them, if the bottom looks slightly golden, you're golden, and place them back into the oven for another 15-20 minutes. And that's it!<br><br>
You mileage may vary on cook time, as always, if you're paranoid cut one in half before eating.<br><br>
Also how much butter and how much crumb mixture may vary, so remember it's okay if you use less and need to melt more butter, whisk another egg, or make more crumb mixture. You won't be able to use this for anything else because of bacteria, so it's okay to use less and end up needing more, than to use a lot and have to throw it away.

<br><b>Easy Lemon Chicken</b><br>
Posted by: Coira (coira_)<br><br>
I have a recipe for you all. :P<br><br>
Easy Lemon Chicken<br><br>
Ingredients:<br>
Boneless, skinless, chicken chests<br>
White onion_<br>
Lemon juice<br><br>
Method:<br>
Cube chicken chests<br>
Finely dice your white onion_ How much you use if up to you, but I tend to eyeball enough to be around 1:3 onion to chicken ratio.<br><br>
In a large, deep sauce pan (you want the sauce pan to have high enough walls to add liquid later), cook the chicken and onions on medium high until almost fully cooked. Turn down the heat to medium low, and add enough lemon juice so that the chicken and onions aren't quite covered and simmer for about half an hour. You want the lemon juice to be bubbling, but not a roiling boil.<br><br>
Make sure to add more lemon juice and turn down the heat a little if you find the lemon juice is simmering down too quickly, it needs about half an hour to make a nice, flavourful sauce.<br><br>
When the sauce is thick, with a brown colour, remove from heat and serve with a rice of your choice. :*<br><br>
Notes: I tend to serve with plain, white rice, since the chicken will be very sour. You can add sugar to the sauce if you want to cut through the sour/bitterness, but I prefer it to pack a punch.

Posted by: Geo (its_mee_abado0)<br><br>
Slice chicken chest thin (about 1/2 inch thickness) and coat lightly in flower.<br><br>
Heat a medium-large ski-llet and melt enough butter in it to coat the bottom. Brown chicken in butter, a few minutes a side.<br><br>
Add juice from 1 lemon, as many capers/caper juice as you like (a few spoonfuls + a spoonful of juice should do), and a heaping pile of spinach.<br><br>
Reduce heat to low-medium, cover the ski-llet and continue cooking until spinach has wilted all the way. (Cover so the spinach steams.)<br><br>
Serve over rice or over noodles for an easy meal. Otherwise, it's good on its own.<br><br>
You can also add fresh garlic cloves or mushrooms to the butter while the chicken cooks to add some flavor or vegetables.

<br><b>Gotcha Pork Roast (Shokugeki no Souma)</b><br>
Posted by: ebonine (ebonine)<br><br>
One recipe I think is really delicious is the Gotcha Pork Roast from the anime Shokugeki no Souma. There are different versions of the recipe online though.<br><br>
The Gotcha Roast recipe that I followed was a Youtube video made by Feast of Fiction, because it was the easiest one. However, I've adjusted my recipe and put more mushrooms and onions_ pretty much a half cup for both) into the potato mix (I added one less potato to taste more of the other flavors). It is also better to boil the potatoes with their skin on, so the batter wouldn't be too wet and be less likely to explode out of the bacon wrap (though the exploded part tastes delicious).<br><br>
There is also a different video by ChefPK on Youtube that probably tastes better (I haven't tried yet) because he is an actual chef. I prefer ChefPK's recipe for the sauce (though I didn't have sake) because the Feast of Fiction sauce was too salty according to all of my family members and it seemed to be better (the video was vague on the sauce instructions, so I may have messed up on it).<br><br>
You should also use smoked bacon (applewood is really good) because it gives the potato more flavor. For some reason all these recipes use like 2 packs bacon, but I'd say 1 is okay. like maybe 12 oz of bacon for like 3 medium potatoes.<br><br>
Yes, thank you so much. I really hope you try to recipe. The steps are pretty easy, though it is time consuming in preparation and baking time. I usually prepare it like 5 hours ahead of time because it does taste better when you leave it in the oven longer for like 2 hours at a slightly lower temp. I don't know if my oven is broken, but the cooking times online don't work for me since I needed to put it at 400 degrees to see any changes in the bacon for a faster baking time. You just have to dice veggies, fry them, then mix mashed potatoes in them. The bacon wrapping part takes more time, since you have to bunch up the mixture and cover it, then tie it. It has a very "Thanksgivingy" taste. Be sure to taste the sauce once in a while when you cook it. I'm still trying to make the sauce better because I don't have much experience cooking with cooking wine, so I've undercooked and overcooked them before and it gets either too sweet or sour. I actually didn't mind because the taste gets blended in with the potato mix, but my sister disliked tasting the sweet sauce and didn't want any on her potatoes at all (don't know if she would have liked it if they were mixed).

Posted by: ACe (acexcat13)<br><br>
I'm just on for a minute right now since I was asked (nicely, for a change) to see about dinner. Requested menu: shrimp scampi.<br><br>
4 Tbsp olive oil<br>
6 green onions_  fine-chopped<br>
4 Tbsp Parsley, fine chopped<br>
2 Tbsp Garlic, minced<br>
1/2 tsp. lemon juice<br>
1/2 tsp white pepper<br>
1-3 tsp salt, to taste<br>
5 Tbsp of old juice from the fruit of a Sauvignon Blanc vineyard<br>
1 Lb. shrimp (20-40ct./Lb is a good size)<br>
 *hint: cutting shrimp in half is a GREAT way to totally skimp.<br><br>
Can sub-in half butter for the olive oil for a richer flavor.<br><br>
Saute garlic in olive oil (and butter, if you want). Add green onion and parsley and saute until softened, about 3 min.<br><br>
Add lemon, salt, pepper and  ...'old graep juice' and saute for about another 3 min.<br><br>
Add shrimp and saute until shrimp is pink and firm. (Cooked all the way through)<br><br>
Serve over angel hair pasta (capellini) and top with parmesan cheese. 
Garlic bread is a fantastic side dish. This ALWAYS impresses guests! <br><br>
The prep work is the long+hard part. Cooking is easy once that's all done.

Posted by: Miss Dawn(missdizzle101)<br><br>
Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy Garlic Salmon<br><br>
4 salmon fillets (skin on is fine)<br>
1/3th cup of butter<br>
5 cloves of garlic (i use the minced garlic where 1 tsp = 1 clove)<br>
1 tbsp brown sugar<br>
1/4 cup of lemon juice<br>
dried thyme (to taste)<br>
dried dill (to taste)<br>
salt (to taste)<br><br>
begin by melting the butter on medium heat<br>
once melted, add garlic<br>
when garlic is soft add the lemon juice and brown sugar<br>
mix well<br>
let heat up<br>
add salmon fillets, bottom side down<br>
sprinkle thyme, dill, and salt as desired on top of fillets (i got light on the dill and salt)<br>
flip fillets over once you note the sides being cooked halfway through (sizes of fillets may vary in cooking times due to thickness of cuts)<br>
cook for equal amount of time, or when noted from the sides that the other side is cooked through<br><br>
This works with other fish too.<br>
The fillet size will determine how long the cook time is.<br><br>
Thinner fish, shorter time.<br>
Thicker fish, longer time.<br>

Aiight I made the recipe..... it was... very lemony in my opinion. If it's going for a poached kinda salmon vibe I'd cut the lemon juice in half. I also tend to like strong spices XD So I bumped those up a lot.<br></div>

... Far's salmon goes, mix dill, parsley, a LITTLE lemon and salt in yogurt, cover with the mix and bake for 45-60 min. until STARTING to brown around the edges.<br><br>
Normally, fish would be turned to leather by then, but because the topping seals in the moisture, it keeps it really nice. Just use a firm spatula to separate from the skin and serve with rice pilaf to impress guests. B)<br><br>
Oh... and it HAS TO BE just PLAIN yogurt.<br><br>
We made the mistake of using vanilla yogurt once, and it was inedible. *cry*<br><br>

Notes from Dumpling (Feb 2021)<br><br>
This is the most moist, tender salmon we've ever had! Delish!! We were worried about moisture evaporating so we covered the baking dish with foil and it didn't brown even after an hour, but it wasn't an issue. If you're worried about buying fresh dill/parsley and not being able to use them in time, you can freeze them! Both freeze very well and keep for months. Just wash, pat dry with paper towel, chop finely, and freeze them in freezer-safe boxes, ice cube trays, zip locks, etc. And then make this anytime! :D

ok so<br><br>
salmon in the oven<br>
I buy the vacuumed sealed frozen boneless scaleless filets from costco &amp; just thaw them in water the same night imma cook them.<br><br>
you line a pan with foil, put in the salmon (skin down), salt and pepper them, top them with the sauce (next post) &amp; then put another piece of foil on top to make like a packet<br><br>
then it's like 20 min at 350<br>
spoon sauce back over the salmon and broil for a couple min<br><br>
2 Tablespoons olive oil<br>
1/4 cup brown sugar (4 Tbsp)<br>
1/4 cup soy sauce (4 Tbsp)<br>
3 garlic cloves minced<br>
juice of one lemon<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
1/2 teaspoon pepper<br><br>
and just whisk it together<br><br>
I'm primo lazy so for the garlic cloves I use the big jar of already minced stuff &amp; lemon juice from a bottle (both costco)<br><br>
(that same method can be used with whatever sauce you want though... lemon garlic is another popular option)<br><br>
I hope it works out for you. it's my go to for like...having to cook real dinner<br><br>

Tip from dumpling (dumpling130) (9/10)<br><br>
This is a family favorite of ours! We've been making our salmon like this almost every time since June or so. The salmon comes out wonderfully moist and flavorful, even without the broiler part. Many, many thanks to Ackie for posting this recipe :*<br><br>
A few adjustments we make:<br>
* Add 1/2-1 tsp of ginger powder (or grated ginger). (All spices are TT really.)<br>
* Omit the salt, as the soy sauce is salty already.<br>
* Mix the black pepper in with the sauce and just pour it on top of the fish, lifting the fillets a bit so the sauce goes under. There is oil in the sauce, so the fish won't stick.<br>
* I think the purpose of the broiler is to caramelize the sugar a bit. We experimented with 2 and 4 Tbsp of sugar and with 4, the sauce was a bit sweeter, but we didn't get a lot of caramelization. Maybe it's our broiler? Not sure. So we usually use 2 Tbsp of sugar and just take it out of the oven, spoon the sauce back over and serve.<br>
* Great over regular or cauliflower rice with parsley!<br>
* Double the sauce and use it on salad, fried rice, etc ;)<br></div>

Preheat oven to 350 F. Line baking dish with aluminum foil and lightly grease with olive oil.<br><br>
In a bowl, mix:<br>
- 3 Tbsp dijon mustard<br>
- 2 Tbsp honey<br>
- 1 Tbsp lemon juice<br>
- 1 clove garlic<br>
- sea salt and pepper TT<br>
- smoked paprika (optional)<br><br>
Spread the sauce over the top and sides of the fish. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes until cooked through. (The foil covering the fish helps it steam and stay juicy.)<br><br>
Serve over hot regular or cauliflower rice with fresh chopped parsley. Enjoy!<br><br>
We used this sauce for 3x 6-oz fillets but you can simply double it if you're making more or like the sauce :)

<br><b>Miso Salmon</b><br>
Credit: Just One Cookbook<br>
Posted by: Dumpling (dumpling130)<br><br>
Delicious Japanese-style baked salmon recipe!<br><br>
Marinade:<br><br>
2 Tbsp miso (white or awase/combination)<br>
1 Tbsp sake (rice wine)<br>
1 Tbsp mirin<br>
1 Tbsp soy sauce<br>
1/4 tsp sesame oil<br><br>
^Mix and marinade the salmon for 30-60 min (not too long bc the miso is very salty). Miso burns easily, so brush extra marinade off the salmon, place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 10-12 min @ 425 F (218 C), until the surface is blistered/brown a bit. ​Serve over ginger rice and sprinkle with toasted white sesame seeds &amp; chopped scallions. Enjoy!<br><br>
The marinade is enough for 3-4 small filets. You can't really reuse it, so don't make too much. However! After you put the salmon in the oven, you can heat the extra marinade in a saucepan until just cooked through and then use it as a sauce :)<br><br>

Posted by: Dumpling (dumpling130)<br><br>
As written in the newspaper :)<br>
Miso-Glazed Eggplant<br>
With a Bowl of Rice<br><br>
You know how to make rice. For the rest, grab some small eggplants - the Japanese variety is a good option - and cut them on the bias into little steaks. Drizzle them with neutral oil and roast in a 400-degree oven for 20 minutes or so, turning them once or twice, until they're soft. Then crank the oven to broil, and paint them with white miso that's been cut with splashes of sesame oil and rice wi-ne, a smaller splash of soy and a few grinds of black pepper. Let that get going until the skin begins to pop, then serve those little vegetarian flavor steaks over rice, with a spray of sesame seeds over the top.<br><br>
Notes:<br>
* White miso is a little sweet. for a more forceful glaze, you might try red miso instead.<br>
* Sesame seeds are a fine pantry item. Lately, though, I've been replacing them with jars of furikake, the Japanese seasoning mix that you can find at Asian grocers, and that my kids call "shake."

Tips from Dumpling (dumpling130):<br><br>
* To remove more salt/preservatives, rinse the noodles before adding the seasoning! Boil extra water, cover noodles with hot water and swish them around for 30 sec or so. Drain the water. Then prepare as usual: add hot water and seasoning and let them steep for 3-5 min.<br><br>
* Prepare them in a small pot on the stove (basically same process, just boil water on the stove) and add stuff! Cra-ck an egg in (stir for the egg drop effect, or leave it be and it'll poach), add cabbage, green onions_ nori/dried seawe-ed, whatever you think will go well :D<br><br>
Instant noodles are actually my go-to whenever I feel a cold coming on bc the salt content helps with sore throat (^^)b<br></div>

I've tried to make it before, and while it was tasty, it turned out a greasy, oily mess with under-cooked veggies, so did some adjustments.<br><br>
NOT An easy recipe, and not sure what 'area' or 'style' this would be.<br><br>
Start by THIN-slicing a cabbage and steaming it to soften.<br>
Fine-dice half an onion and grate half a carrot.<br>
Fry about 8-10 slices of bacon. Crumble and set aside. Save the oil.<br><br>
In a bowl, mix 2 cups of flour (GF mix worked fine), 1 1/2 cup water, 1/4 cup oyster sauce and two eggs.<br><br>
Once the flour, water, oyster sauce and eggs are smooth, mix in the onion_ carrot, cabbage and MOST of the bacon... save some bacon (and mabe add some fine-chopped green onion_ for garnish.<br><br>
Put 1 Teaspoon of bacon grease, 1 Tbsp of olive oil and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil in a medium pan over medium heat and place about 1 cup of your mixture in the pan, flatten it with a spoon and cover.<br><br>
Cook for about 5-8 minutes (until the top is STARTING to firm up) and then flip the pancake.<br><br>
...note...<br><br>
Note: Unless you're really good with using the pan-toss method to flip things, you'll need a REEAAALLLY Big spatula or it will fall apart on you.<br><br>
Once you flip it over, add a little more oil to the pan if necessary and cook covered for another 5 minutes or so. Veggies should be soft.<br><br>
CAREFULLY place it on a paper towel for about a minute.<br><br>
Top with a sauce, garnish with bacon+green onion and serve.<br><br>
Sauce I made was yogurt, oyster sauce and pepper sauce (Tapatio) with a sprinkle of salt.<br><br>
Helpful tips:<br><br>
-BIG SPATULA. Maybe not anime-big, but these things break apart way too easy before they're fully cooked. Turning them without breaking is a challenge.<br><br>
-Keep it from sticking to the pan as best you can. Swirl, nudge, jitter, lift, whatever works best for you. If it sticks, it auto-breaks, and that's messy.<br><br>
-Adjust the oil and use as little as possible. This dish is oily enough, so use only enough to keep it from sticking to the pan.<br><br>
NOT Easy, but a yummy treat.<br>
Enjoy. :D

I took like three years of culinary classes and one of the biggest issues that was causing people to trip up was cooking on a high heat just to get done faster.

<br><b>TIP: Peeling garlic faster</b><br>
Posted by: astraly insomnia (_kunay_)<br><br>
Peeling garlic faster:<br><br>
1.) Wrap garlic cloves in a paper towel. Put in mic for about 10 seconds. Peeling will come right off.<br><br>
2.) OR gently put pressure on garlic with the flat of your knife until you hear a crunch (not too much to smash it). Part of the peel will be split and you can just unwrap it off the garlic.<br><br>
(Moist paper towel?) Dumpling, no it does not have to be moist (:.

<div class="box"><br><b>Matcha donuts / Mini cupcakes</b><br>
Credit: The Tasty K<br><br>
Prep:<br>
Preheat oven to 350 F (175 C)<br>
Slightly grease a donut pan (6 pcs) or mini cupcake pan (24 pcs)<br><br>
Bowl #1: Mix: <br>
1 cup flour<br>
1/4 c coconut sugar<br>
1 Tbsp matcha *<br>
1 tsp baking powder<br>
1/2 tsp baking soda<br>
pinch of salt<br><br>
Bowl #2: Mix: <br>
3/4 cup plant milk<br>
1 tsp apple cider vinegar<br>
2 Tbsp maple syrup<br>
2-2.5 Tbsp coconut oil, melted<br>
1/2 tsp vanilla extract **<br><br>
Pour 2 into 1 and mix until just combined. Spoon batter into pan and bake for 8-9 min (until wooden toothpick comes out dry).<br><br>
Glaze: Mix: <br>
1/2 C powder sugar +<br>
1/4 tsp matcha ++<br>
1 tsp lemon juice<br>
1 Tbsp plant milk<br><br>
Top donuts/cupcakes with glaze, or enjoy plain ^^<br><br>
Modifications!<br>
*If you don't have/like matcha, feel free to sub in 1 Tbsp + 1 tsp cocoa powder or instant coffee. To make it plain, just sub in 1 Tbsp flour.<br><br>
**Can also sub in almond extract. This works really well with the "plain" flavor!<br><br>
+The original recipe says 1 C, but that's way too much! I only used 1/2 C and used half the glaze.<br><br>
++Sub in instant coffee. Cocoa sub did not work for me for some reason.<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
Adding some pics! Cocoa, coffee, plain, and matcha donuts with various glazes. I usually make them without the glaze - they're fantastic and lower in sugar! :)<br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/tmzxy1v9ochy7kx/MiniDonuts1.JPG" width="200">~<img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/4yhj4w5njvyc8tx/MiniDonuts2.JPG" width="200"><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/wkdo53wvqihar0v/MiniDonuts-Matcha1.JPG" width="200">~<img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/3dmg8bo86bnczpu/MiniDonuts3.JPG" width="200"><br><i><font size="2">(To view full pic, drag and drop the image into your browser's address line or right click and open image in a new tab.)</font></i><br><br>

Credit: Bon Appetit<br>
Posted by Maureen (secrets101)<br><br>
From Dumpling: This is a delicious loaf cake! Many thanks to Maureen for sharing! I read through a lot of the comments on the BA website and included the most popular tips and subs here, but check their forum for more ideas.<br><br>
You will need a 9x5" or 8.5x4.5" loaf pan. An 8x8" square pan should also work. From BA: "If you're not sure what size your loaf pan is, measure it with a ruler from inside edge to inside edge for both the length and width. If you measure from the outside edge, you'll get an inaccurate reading of the width of the pan, and your cake may end up overflowing! It's the actual empty space of the pan where the cake bakes that matters here, not the width of the entire pan including its edges.<br><br>
Tip for muffins / cupcakes from forum: "I made it as 18 cupcakes, baked for about 20 minutes at 350 (convection oven)<br><br>
INGREDIENTS:<br><br>
* 1 cup vegetable oil, plus more for pan  <br>
(TIP: Reduce to 3/4 (or even 2/3) cup oil )<br>
(SUB: Sunflower or other neutral oil, apple sauce*, banana*)<br>
* 2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour <br>
* 1 1/2 tsp Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt <br>
* 1/2 tsp baking powder<br>
* 1/2 tsp baking soda<br>
* 2 large eggs<br>
* 1 1/4 cups (250 g) granulated sugar<br>
( TIP: Reduce by 1/3 c = 15 Tbsp (1 cup minus 1 Tbsp) )<br>
(SUB: Coconut sugar OR 3/4 cup maple syrup*)<br>
* 1 cup plain whole-milk yogurt<br>
* 3 Tbsp loose-leaf Earl Grey tea (ground) or 1/4 cup tea from bags<br>
* 2 tsp vanilla extract<br>
( TIP: Omit vanilla ext, it does not complement bergamot)<br>
* 1 Tbsp raw or granulated sugar for topping<br><br>
MORE IDEAS from BA forum:<br>
* Add lemon zest from 1-2 lemons, or 2 tsp orange zest + orange extract<br><br>
PREPARATION:<br><br>
1. Preheat oven to 325 F. Lightly coat the loaf pan with vegetable oil and line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on long sides.<br><br>
2. Whisk in a  medium bowl to combine:<br>
* 2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour<br>
* 1.5 tsp Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt<br>
* 1/2 tsp baking powder<br>
* 1/2 tsp baking soda<br><br>
3. Vigorously whisk in a large bowl for 1 minute (seriously, time it!)<br>
* 2 large eggs<br>
* 1 1/4 cups (250 g) granulated sugar<br>
( TIP: Reduce by 1/3 c to 15 Tbsp (1 cup -1 Tbsp))<br><br>
Mixture should be pale yellow and frothy.<br><br>
Whisk in:<br>
* 1 cup plain whole-milk yogurt<br>
* 3 Tbsp loose-leaf Earl Grey tea (or 1/4 cup tea from bags)<br> 
* 2 tsp vanilla extract <br>
(TIP: Omit vanilla ext, it does not complement bergamot)<br><br>
4. Gradually stream in 1 cup vegetable oil (TIP: reduce to 3/4 c oil), whisking constantly until incorporated. (Place a kitchen towel or moist paper towel under your bowl to stabilize it so that you have two free hands.) Add dry ingredients and whisk to combine. Scra-pe batter into prepared pan and smooth top. Gently tap pan against surface to eliminate any air bubbles.<br><br>
5. Sprinkle evenly with 1 Tbsp raw or granulated sugar. Bake cake until a skewer or toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.<br><br>
6. Let cool 15 minutes in pan, then run a butter knife or offset spatula between the cake and pan to release. Lift it out using parchment overhang and transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm or room temperature (or even better, toast slices and slather them with butter!).<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
NOTES from dumpling (May 30, 2021):<br><br>
Love this loaf cake!! I followed the tips in the comments and reduced the oil and sugar. I used coconut sugar, which produced a darker cake and adds a unique flavor. If you want a lighter cake and/or more tea flavor, use white sugar. If you're using loose tea leaves, grind them down to a powder using a mortar and pestle, coffee/spice grinder, or blender on high. If you're using tea bags, you'll need 9-12 baggies (usually there is 1 tsp of tea per bag).<br><br>
* If using APPLE SAUCE or BANANA instead of oil: The purpose of the oil is to add moisture. If using apple sauce, try subbing only ~50%. I tried subbing in all apple sauce and the cake was a little mushy, though a couple of people on the forums reported success. Likewise with banana, I'd recommend no more than 1/2 cup banana + 1/4+ cup oil. The banana flavor does come through so you may want to add more tea. If using MAPLE SYRUP, again, only sub in up to 50% so as not to add too much moisture. (Mushy cakes are still delicious though!)<br><br>
Pic notes: Cake is darker because I used coconut sugar. For a lighter cake, use white sugar. I'll do that next time and update. Also, I forgot to sprinkle sugar on top, oops. Guess I have to make it again :)<br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/3mkq6x9znvjx109/EarlGreyYogCake-1.jpg" width="200" height="150"> ~ <img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/f3bnjru52sr1qnk/EarlGreyYogCake-3.JPG" width="200" height="150"><br><i><font size="2">(To view full pic, drag and drop the image into your browser's address line or right click and open image in a new tab.)</font></i>

Posted by Midge (princess_poppy3)<br><br>
(Use a small plastic Tupperware/takeaway box)<br><br>
4 TBSP Self-Raising flour<br>

3 TBSP Vegetable oil<br>

Few drops Vanilla<br>
Few Choc Chips (optional)<br><br>

NOTES:<br>
Self-rising flour sub:<br>
4 Tbsp self-rising flour = 1/4 cup, so...<br><br>
1/4 cup all purpose flour<br>
3/8 tsp baking powder (just approximate bw 1/4 tsp and 1/2 tsp)<br>
1/8 tsp salt<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
NOTES-2:<br>
I tried this one! I didn't have all ingredients, so here are my substitutions / modifications:<br>
- Coconut sugar (whirled in a coffee grinder to make it finer)<br>
- Peanut butter (instead of chocolate spread)<br>
- Olive oil<br>
- 4 small squares of chopped choco<br>
- Microwaved for 2 min + 30 sec + 30 sec = 3 min total for me (our microwave is a little old)<br><br>
There's a faint hint of peanut butter and the chocolate flavor is more subdued, but those bites with the chocolate 'chips' were just heavenly!<br><br>
I'd recommend putting in at least 8-12 squares of chocolate, especially if you use a different spread. Or more, to taste ;)<br><br>
Btw, this makes one big portion, so it's great to share with one other person ^^ I used a 5x5 inch tupperware box and it rose to about 1.5-2 inches. If no one else is around, you can share with your future self :)

2 Tbsp plain flour<br>
1/8 tsp baking powder<br>
1 egg yolk **<br>

Goes very well ice cream ;)<br><br>
* SUB: matcha powder + white choco chips<br>
** Egg yolk adds texture. Do NOT put in a whole egg! The egg white will keep in the fridge for a few days. Add it to scrambled eggs, pancake batter, <a href="#4k">Flourless Chocolate Cookies</a>, etc.<br><br>

Comments from dumpling<br><br>
I used coconut sugar, sunflower oil, plant milk, and chopped dark choco (72%), and it was done in 75 seconds. Delicious and really took a bit of the edge off an exhausting day :)<br><br>
A few days after this, I tried subbing in matcha &amp; chopped white chocolate and it was really, really good!!<br><br>

I feel like if you're not allergic to nuts it might be good with peanutbutter chips.

Bake per cake instructions but poke with a tooth pick, it's usually a little underdone but if no slimy cake pulls up, you're good!

I know a mug cake thats quick and low calories. It's called 3-2-1 cake. its a box of angelfood cake mixed with a box of any other cake mix you like. you use 3 tablespoons of cake mix, 2 tablespoons of milk or water and mix them in a cup, and then microwave for one minute :) its cheap and lasts forever, keep it in a ziplock gallon bag and its cake on demand.

<div class="box"><br><b>TIPS: Baking notes / mistakes to avoid</b><br><b>+ TIP: Tea</b><br><br>
I posted this on the board, so I'll include it here:<br><br>
Earl Grey Cake (Bon Appetit) update...<br>
The top half of the cake is yum yum yum. The bottom half is mushy (lol)<br><br>
THE RECIPE IS TOTALLY FINE! The flavor is on point. My substitutions were a little too ambitious, and I knew it. Rest assured, this is edible, and it will be gone in a few days, then I'll redeem myself with another batch :) So here's what not to do...<br><br>
Baking is all about chemistry. You don't need to know all the details to make a good cake, but it helps to know ingredients' basic functions if you decide to substitute.<br><br>
This cake calls for granulated sugar, oil and yogurt. <br><br>
I used maple syrup, apple sauce and yogurt = Too much liquid &amp; not enough fat.<br><br>
Better idea: maple syrup, butter and yogurt. That would -probably- work.<br><br>
Sugar creates pockets of air which combines with the effect of the baking powder/soda reactions to make the cake rise and become tender, by preventing gluten formation. Maple syrup sub well in most quick breads. I make banana bread with maple syrup and yoghurt and it's the fluffiest thing :D The trouble is here I also put in apple sauce, which has no fat…<br><br>
Fat helps hold everything together and make it tender, by shortening the gluten strands. I saw an example somewhere of a cinnamon roll and baguette. Both are yeast breads, but the cin roll has fat and baguette doesn't. Another example is croissants. Croissants require a lot of butter to be crispy and flakey. Reduce the butter and you'll get a bread-like pasty.<br><br>
Btw, someone reported using apple sauce successfully in this recipe! But they also used sugar ;)<br><br>
Last tip is on yoghurt. In some baked goods, yoghurt cannot cook through because it has too much moisture. With a good balance of dry ingredients, it works beautifully and adds healthy proteins and acidity, which gives baking soda something to react with. In this case… too much liquid ^^;<br><br>
So if you decide to sub ingredients, subbing 25-50% of X is safer, esp if you're not feeling too confident. A lot of times that leaves enough of X for the chemistry to do its thing, and you get your own twist ;)<br><br>
I've had apple sauce in the back of the fridge for too long and desperately wanted to use it (lol) I don't like it bc it's really bland. If anyone has any recipe ideas, please let me know!<br><br>
Note: I am not a baking expert! If I made a mistake above, please correct me!<br><br>
I like to bake bc we enjoy having muffins/quick breads for breakfast and as snacks, and the store-bought ones are pricy and often have way too much sugar. Quick breads are really um quick(!) to make and flexible, so you can try subs, make it healthier and tweak flavors to your liking. And learn some chem along the way ;)<br><br>
~ ~ ~TEA ~ ~ ~<br><br>
My cake didn't turn out as planned, but the flavor is soooo good! It has a sophisticated and elegant personality  Kudos to Bon Appetit!<br><br>
FYI - I used about 9 bags of Twinnings Earl Grey Tea. If you can, just get loose leaf and grind it. I felt bag cutting 9 baggies<br><br>
Fun fact: <br>
This recipe calls for 3 Tbsp of tea if using loose leaf or fresh tea (more if tea is aired out).<br><br>
1 Tbsp = 3 tsp<br>
3 Tbsp = 9 tsp<br>
I used 9 bags.<br>
So each Twinnings tea bag has 1 tsp of tea! :D<br><br>
Bonus: You generally use 1/2 - 1 tsp of loose leaf tea per cup. So... Twinnings portion it out just right :D (Unlike those cheapskates who package chips = =+)

<br><b>TIPS: Mug cake experiments:<br>
Egg subs &amp; egg yolk purpose</b><br>
Posted by: Julia (faulse_wolfe) &amp; dumpling (dumpling130)<br><br>
This discussion began with the <a href="#23a">Midnight Mug Cake</a>, which includes an egg yolk. Most mug cakes leave eggs out altogether. We conducted some experiments so you don't have to :P<br><br>~<br><br>
Notes from Julia 10/18<br>
Re: Apple cider vinegar (ACV)<br><br>
It's afternoon but I'm currently trying the midnight mug cake...<br><br>
Tjo you recommended 2, I still went with 3tbsp APF. Too lazy to separate the yolk so I didn't put an egg in :P mixed in 1 tbsp ACV and a tsp of baking soda (read somewhere this was a good sub for an egg in baked goods) instead :D done after 120 seconds in the microwave. No ACV taste at all or maybe I went too far with the "handful" of choc chips *lol*<br><br>
Tried taking a pic for you but it doesn't look so IG worthy so I scrapped it XD<br><br>
This would be very good with vanilla ice cream *drooling face emoji**drooling face emoji*<br><br>
Left it to cool for a while before eating it all.<br><br>
I realize now that it could have done with less time in the microwave XD maybe just 90 seconds would do. I was imagining it to be on the fluffy side but it is dense, and not crumbly. Also it is not very smooth but this is my fault maybe because I didn't mix it very well, oops *lol*<br><br>
Anyway, still tastes like chocolate so it is fine :D<br><br>
I think a mashed banana would go well with the batter :D next time :D<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
Notes from dumpling 10/18<br>
Re: Purpose of the egg yolk<br><br>
Julia, I love your experiments! :D I hadn't thought of using ACV. The 3 vs 2 Tbsp flour is actually as written by the author but I agree with him. The first time, I used 3 and it was also a little dense. The next time, I used 2 and it was a little fluffier. I was wondering why the egg is split. Usually eggs make things fluffy so I'll try using a whole egg (Many mug cakes don't use eggs at all.)<br><br>
Aha OK... from Poogle:<br><br>
{ Egg whites add volume and act as a drying and leavening agent. Egg yolks provide fat, which adds flavor and tenderness, and protein, which helps thicken custards. }<br><br>
{ Recipes that use just the yolk of an egg typically do so for the yolk's fat content and emulsifying abilities. The fat gives baked goods extra-rich flavor and a velvety texture. }<br><br>
A lot of mug cake recipes say eggs make it spongy. Also a full size cake only requires 2-3 eggs, so a whole egg in one mug is too much. That's probably why John split it and just kept the yolk, for texture.<br><br>
This discovery calls for more experiments 0:-) I'll post back with results this week. And up my cardio in the meantime *lol*<br><br>
I did an experiment with a whole egg vs egg yolk only! BIG difference! Here it is:<br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/7hb2uqagk51cebz/MugCake-WholeEgg-vs-YolkOnly.jpg" width="200" height="150"><br><i><font size="2">(To view full pic, drag and drop the image into your browser's address line or right click and open image in a new tab.)</font></i><br><br>
Same ingredients, ratios, type of mug, time in the microwave... They rose the same amount, but the texture is completely different :o The one on the left has a whole egg and it turned out very dense and spongy. The one on the right has only the yolk and it is fluffy like proper cake :*<br><br>
I have eggs all the time, usually boiled and sunny side up, and I always knew the whites are spongy/rubbery, but I didn't realize what a big difference they can make in baking until now.<br><br>
Eggs help cakes rise/expand, but it's the fat and sugar that makes them fluffy, or flaky in croissants' case, which we talked about in earlier posts on baking tips.<br><br>
So Cool!<br><br>
Next experiment will be egg yolk vs no egg at all, in a few days' time... FOR SCIENCE! B)

Notes from dumpling (Dec 14, 2020)<br><br>
I love how easily this recipe comes together, all in one pot, and resting the dough is not necessary. I thought the butter might be a bit much, but no, it really paid off -- look at how puffy those cookies are! They're delicious, light, and have a lovely kick of ginger :)<br><br>
I doubled the spices as suggested and second that tip. Rolled the dough out to about 1/4-inch thickness for soft-baked style and they were done in 10 min; if you want more snappy cookies, roll the dough thinner. A cookie lover in my family decided to go on a diet (in December of all times!?) so I only made half a batch and got 36 x mini cookies (~2.5 inch).<br><br>

<br><b>Most Wonderful Gingerbread Cookie Recipe</b><br>
Credit: Food.com<br>
Posted by: Nexus (doberman555)<br><br>
look up "most wonderful gingerbread cookie recipe," amp up the ground ginger, and replace all instances of lemon peel with orange (use orange juice in ur royal icing too.)<br><br>
you will not regret.<br><br>
READY IN: 2 hrs 23 mins<br>
YIELD: 24 5-inch cookies<br><br>
INGREDIENTS<br><br>
3 cups all-purpose flour<br>
1 1⁄2 tsp baking powder<br>
3⁄4 tsp baking soda<br>
1⁄4 tsp salt<br>
1 Tbsp ground ginger<br>
1 3⁄4 tsp ground cinnamon<br>
1⁄4 tsp ground cloves<br>
6 Tbsp unsalted butter<br>
3⁄4 cup dark brown sugar<br>
1 large egg<br>
1⁄2 cup molasses<br>
2 tsp vanilla<br>
1 tsp finely grated lemon zest (optional)<br><br>
DIRECTIONS<br><br>
In a small bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves until well blended.<br><br>
In a large bowl (KitchenAid's great for this) beat butter, brown sugar, and egg on medium speed until well blended.
Add molasses, vanilla, and lemon zest and continue to mix until well blended.<br><br>
Gradually stir in dry ingredients until blended and smooth.
Divide dough in half and wrap each half in plastic and let stand at room temperature for at least 2 hours or up to 8 hours.<br><br>
Preheat oven to 375 deg. Prepare baking sheets by lining with parchment paper.<br><br>
(Dough can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, but in this case it should be refrigerated. Return to room temp before using.) Preheat oven to 375°.<br><br>
Grease or line cookie sheets with parchment paper.
Place 1 portion of the dough on a lightly floured surface.
Sprinkle flour over dough and rolling pin.<br><br>
Roll dough to a scant 1/4-inch thick.<br><br>
Use additional flour to avoid sticking.<br><br>
Cut out cookies with desired cutter-- the ginger bread man is our favorite of course.<br><br>
Space cookies 1 1/2-inches apart.<br><br>
Bake 1 sheet at a time for 7-10 minutes (the lower time will give you softer cookies-- very good!).<br><br>
Remove cookie sheet from oven and allow the cookies to stand until the cookies are firm enough to move to a wire rack.<br><br>
After cookies are cool you may decorate them any way you like.
I usually brush them with a powdered sugar glaze when I am in a hurry, but they look wonderful decorated with Royal icing.

<br><b>Pumpkin Cookies</b><br>
Posted by: Cosette (ezel68)<br><br>
This is a recipe my family usually makes in the fall and winter:<br><br>
Pumpkin Cookies<br>
Makes 4 dozen<br><br>
2 cups sifted flour<br>
1 tsp baking soda<br>
1/4 tsp salt<br>
1 tsp cinnamon<br>
1/4 tsp nutmeg<br>
1/2 cup applesauce or butter or margarine<br>
1 cup sugar<br>
1 cup canned pumpkin<br>
1 cup chocolate chips<br>
1 tsp vanilla<br><br>
Preheat oven to 375 F. Sift flour with soda, salt, and spices and set aside. Cream butter with sugar until light, add vanilla and pumpkin, mix well. Slowly add dry ingredients, then stir in chocolate chips. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls 2 in apart on greased or tin foiled baking sheets and bake 15 minutes until lightly browned. Transfer to wire racks to cool.
<br><br>
The original cookie recipe calls for pecans and raisins but my mom likes neither so she's made it with just chocolate chips for years.<br><br>
Recently she did a batch with butter and a batch with applesauce and both came out really nice. So yeah. Very adaptable<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
Comments from Dumpling (Oct 8, 2022)<br>
Love the cookies! Crispy on the outside and soft and pumpkin spice-y inside ^^ Make sure the butter is room temperature. I creamed the butter and (coconut) sugar by hand with a wooden spoon in ~5 min. I used pecans and added choco chips to a few cookies at the end (my mom's not a fan of choco chips :/). The dough is very sticky and difficult to shape, so the cookies will be kinda rustic. Personally, I like the unique look. I used a 1 Tbsp scooper and got ~41 cookies (we lost count, heh :3)<br><br>
(Butter tip: Cold butter can be softened quickly in the microwave on defrost mode / 30% power for 10-15 sec. Alternatively, put some boiling water in a bowl to heat the bowl, then dump the water, flip the bowl upside down and cover the butter to warm it up with residual heat. It may take a couple of tries. ... Dough tip: To firm up the dough, maybe try refrigerating it for 30 min-1 hr or sprinkling the scooper with a little flour.)<br><br>
A few pics! Note: Cookies are darker bc of the coconut sugar.<br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/desl16zsr07vyd9/PumpkinCookies2.JPG" width="200" height="150"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/irx06lizvtehgsa/PumpkinCookies3.JPG" width="200" height="150"><br>

Posted by: ACe (acexcat13)<br><br>
Also, modified a choco-chip cookie recipe to turn it into a Mexican chocolate, choco-chip cookie. B) Little spice, LOT of yum, and let's just say, three batches later, they're still disappearing way too fast! *lol*<br><br>
1 cup packed brown sugar<br>
1/2 cup white sugar<br>
1 cup butter (or substitute)<br><br>
2 tsp. vanilla extract<br>
1 egg<br><br>
1 tsp. baking soda<br>
1 tsp. baking powder<br>
1 Tbsp. ground cinnamon<br>
1/2 tsp. ground cayenne pepper<br>
~2 1/2 cups all purpose flour<br><br>
1/4 - 1/2 cup cocoa powder<br>
2 cups choco chips<br><br>
Pre-heat oven to 350F.<br>
Cream butter and sugars until smooth.<br>
Mix in egg and vanilla.<br>
Mix in all dry ingredients... hold back some of the flour and keep adding it until dough no longer sticks to the bowl... may end up more or less than 2 1/2 cups.<br>
Mix in choco chips.<br><br>
Bake on greased cookie sheets until cookies are firm... time varies, so could be anywhere from 8 to 13 minutes.<br><br>
Allow to cool on sheets before transferring to cooling racks.<br><br>
Lastly, and most importantly, DO NOT eat like five or six of these things instead of eating breakfast. You'll regret it. Not that I would know. 0:-)<br>
Issa lovely recipe, and at this point, I know the ingredients without the book in front of me for the base recipe. *heart*<br><br>
No kidding, the tummy-ache and the sugar-crash are SOooooo not worth it.<br>
These things are real treats! :D<br>
....but not breakfast, no by themselves. :/<br>
For a mid-morning pick-me-up, they're PERFECT! *clap*<br><br>

Comments from Dumpling (Aug 2021)<br><br>
These cookies are divine! :*:* I kept putting them off bc I don't have a  mixer, but actually they come together very easily w/out one. I creamed the (room temperature) butter and sugar by hand while watching TV. I used 1/2 cup of cocoa powder and only 1 1/3 cup of choco chips (only had one packet on hand) and that was a great balance for us. My mom is not a big fan of choco foods and she loved these. My brother loves choco and also loved them. They both said any more choco and they would be too rich, though I'd try 1 1/2 cup of chips next time. 1 Tbsp of cinnamon is just right: there is only a light hint of cinnamon in the cookies and I think it helps balance the choco so it's not overpowering. The cayenne pepper adds a nice little kick at the very end of the cookie experience *chef's kiss* Thank you, ACe!<br><br>

<br><b>Vanilla Choco Chip Cookies</b><br>
Posted by: Milo (leitra)<br><br>
1 cup granulated sugar<br>
1 and a half cups brown sugar<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
1 cup butter, melted<br>
2 eggs<br>
4 tablespoons vanilla extract (trust me)<br>
2 and a half cups all-purpose flour<br>
1 teaspoon baking soda (Or bi-carb soda)<br>
8 oz (220g)(or more!!!) chocolate chips (Don't cheap out, get the best+yummiest you can find)<br><br>
Mix both sugars in a bowl. Microwave the butter for a minute to melt it, combine it with the sugars and mix. This'll mostly melt the sugars.<br><br>
Add your flour, salt and baking soda (or bi-carb) and mix gently with a spoon. Add in your eggs + vanilla essence, mix again. Fold in all of the chocolate chips loosely. Cling wrap it and pop it in the fridge for at least an hour. The longer you leave it, the better the taste will be, since that butter+sugar trick basically gives the cookie a toffee-like flavour.<br><br>
Use a tablespoon of chilled mix per cookie.<br><br>
WARNING: This will make 40-60 cookies. I live in a house of 3 other adults thus the size<br><br>
Preheat the oven to 350f (180C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper (baking paper). Bake for 12-15 mins or until the edges start to lightly brown.<br><br>
Enjoy :)<br><br>

<br><b>Crispy and Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe</b><br>
Credit: Inquiring Chef<br>
Posted by: char (meepitiest)<br><br>
i just tried a chewy choc cookie recipe from inquiringchef dot com and its awesome! probably the best ive ever had. super easy too : ) its called "crispy and chewy chocolate chip cookie recipe" on their site!<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
EQUIPMENT:<br>
Stand Mixer<br>
Mixing Bowls<br>
Half Sheet Pan<br><br>
INGREDIENTS:<br>
3 cups (375g) All-Purpose Flour (see note)<br>
1 teaspoon Baking Soda<br>
¾ teaspoon Kosher Salt<br>
2 sticks (1 cup) Unsalted Butter, softened to room temperature (see note)<br>
1 cup (200g) Light Brown Sugar, packed<br>
1 cup (200g) Granulated (White) Sugar<br>
2 large Eggs<br>
2 teaspoons Pure Vanilla Extract<br>
2+1/2 cups Semisweet Chocolate Chips<br>
1 teaspoon Flaked Sea Salt (totally optional, but try it if you like a salty finish on your sweets)<br><br>
INSTRUCTIONS:<br>
1. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.<br>
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar on medium-high until light and creamy, about 3 minutes (it should resemble fluffy frosting).<br>
3. Add the eggs and vanilla and mix on low until completely combined, scraping down the bowl as needed.<br>
4. Add the flour mixture all at once and mix on low until just combined (stop mixing as soon as there are no dry spots of flour in the dough - do not overmix).<br>
5. Add the chocolate chips and mix into the batter on low just until combined.<br>
6. Transfer the mixing bowl to the refrigerator and refrigerate for 20 minutes while the oven heats. (This step is important as the cold dough is key to the soft centers of the cookies.)<br><br>
7. Heat oven to 350°F / 177°C.<br>
8. Lightly grease a sheet pan or line it with a Silpat baking mat or parchment paper.<br>
9. Use a tablespoon measuring spoon (use the measuring spoon as a guide, but make these "heaping" tablespoons with dough rounded over the top) to scoop out even portions of cold cookie dough. (Note: Be sure that the cookie dough is about the size of a golf ball. If the cookies are smaller than this they won't spread out enough to have soft, chewy centers.)<br>
10. Arrange the cookie dough on the prepared sheet pan, leaving space for the cookies to spread out.<br>
11. Bake the cookies until the edges are just starting to turn golden brown and the centers are still very pale and soft (they will continue to firm up and darken after you remove them from the oven), 9 to 12 minutes.<br>
12. When you remove the sheet pan from the oven, tap it firmly on the kitchen counter a few times to deflate the cookies (this step helps to give the cookies lightly crinkled edges and a dense center).<br>
13. Sprinkle the tops of the cookies with flaked sea salt (this is optional and you may not need the full amount; just add a small pinch on top of each cookie if you want that salty crunch).<br>
14. Leave the cookies on the sheet pan to cool for 5 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack. (Note: If you try to move them too early they may fall apart, but will firm up as they cool.)<br>
15. Store cookies in a sealed container at room temperature for up to 3 days.<br><br>
To Freeze: Cookie dough can be formed into ba-lls and frozen on a sheet pan. Transfer the dough ba-lls to a freezer-safe bag and freeze for up to 6 months. To cook, bake the cookie dough directly from the freezer at 325°F / 163°C for 16 to 18 minutes.<br><br>

<br><b>1 Minute Microwave Chocolate Chip Cookie</b><br>
Credit: Emma's Goodies<br>
Posted by: Dumpling (dumpling130)<br><br>
I'm not a fan of cooking in the microwave generally, but after the cake turned out so well, I saw this (thanks, YooyuTube recommendations :K) and was intrigued. It's actually really good!! And you can pick it up and break it open just like a regular oven-baked cookie :D<br><br>
Btw this is a BIG cookie (^-^)/<br><br>
1 Minute Microwave CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE ! The EASIEST Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe<br>
(Video on YooyuTube)<br><br>
INGREDIENTS:<br><br>
1+1/2 Tbsp butter (20 g)<br>
1+3/4 Tbsp brown sugar (25 g) *<br>
3/4 Tbsp milk of choice (10 g)<br>
1/3 cup + 1/2 Tbsp all purpose flour (55 g) **<br>
1/8 tsp baking soda<br>
Pinch of salt<br>
Chocolate chips / chopped chocolate<br><br>
SUBSTITUTIONS:<br><br>
* This is on the sweet side imo. I used 1 Tbsp + 1 tsp coconut sugar. (1 Tbsp = 3 tsp)<br><br>
** You can sub 25-50% of the flour with wheat flour if you like. I subbed in all wheat flour and the cookie was a bit dry.<br><br>
If you want to make it a double chocolate cookie, sub ~1 Tbsp of the flour with 1 Tbsp cocoa powder. I haven't tested this yet. Will report back later.<br><br>
INSTRUCTIONS:<br><br>
1. Melt the butter in the microwave, then mix in the sugar and milk until the sugar melts a bit.<br><br>
2. Add the flour, baking soda and salt. Mix until just combined. Add chocolate.<br><br>
3. Scoop out the dough with your hands, shape it into a ball, then flatten it into a cookie shape. Lay it on parchment paper or a plate. (DO NOT MICROWAVE ALUMINUM FOIL.)<br><br>
4. Microwave for 1 min ~ 1 min 15 sec max. Do not overbake-blocked- will be dry on top and very soft. Allow it to set for 15 minutes before picking it up (or eat with a spoon if you're impatient like me 0:-)).<br><br>

Ooooh, I have the easiest and tastiest recipe for peanut butter cookies. It's literally just a cup of peanut butter, a cup of brown sugar, one egg, and a packet of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Then bake at 350F for 7ish minutes; don't overbake them or the bottoms get too dark! You have to let them sit and cool for a decent while too, or they'll just crumble to bits.

I love the compiled page of fun and yummy recipes, will be saving for my own reference! I don't have anything too exciting to contribute but here's a funky tip! If you use sunflower butter in a cookie recipe with baking soda, the chlorophyll will react with the baking powder and turn green in the middle when baked!<br><br>
theyre so fun, also a great alternative for those who have tree nut allergies! I made them for halloween this year, hope yours turn out well dumpling! ^__^ thank you for what you do here!<br><br>

Green cookies?!?! Intrigued by Grub's tip on baking chemistry, I tried a recipe and these cookies are amazing! If you are familiar with Middle Eastern confections, the flavor is reminiscent of halvah. And look at that green!!<br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/s3iow1kehb3sp3o/SunButterCookies-2.jpg" width="200" height="150"><br><i><font size="2">(To view full pic, drag and drop the image into your browser's address line or right click and open image in a new tab.)</font></i>
<br><br>
INGREDIENTS<br><br>
* 1 cup no sugar added SunButter<br>
* 1/2 cup maple syrup<br>
* 1 large egg<br>
* 1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
* 6 tablespoons coconut flour<br>
* 1 teaspoon baking soda<br>
* 1/2 cup dairy free mini chocolate chips (optional)<br><br>
INSTRUCTIONS<br><br>
* In a large bowl, combine SunButter, maple syrup and the eggs. Mix well. Add in the salt, coconut flour, and baking soda. Mix until no dry spots remain. Fold in the chocolate chips if using. <br><br>
* Refrigerate for at least one hour or over night.<br><br>
* Preheat oven to 350 F and line a sheet tray with parchment paper. Scoop 1 tablespoon ba-lls onto the sheet tray. Roll between palms to get smooth and press down slightly. You should get about 19 cookies.  <br><br>
* Bake for 8 minutes. Let cool to get the inside to turn green.<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
Tips from dumpling (Jan 24, 2021):<br>
* You can use any brand sunflower seed butter<br>
* If you use unsweetened SSB, as the recipe says, add 1 Tbsp coconut flour or the dough will be stickier and the cookies a bit too soft.<br>
* If you use sweetened SSB, reduce maple syrup and do not add the extra 1 Tbsp coconut flour.<br>
* I used a 1 Tbsp ice cream scooper and got 24 cookies.<br>
* Choco chips don't make a big difference imho.<br><br>

<br><b>TIP: Margarine vs butter in baking</b><br>
Posted by: Grandmaster Moon (moonlightfear)<br><br>
Food-related comment...does anyone happen to know what differences happen in baking things like cookies and muffins from scratch when you use margarine instead of butter? I've been thinking about switching due to how expensive butter is but don't want to ruin cookies<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
Comment from Kitty (vbnkg):<br><br>
@moonlightfear, I used to bake with margarine back when I couldn't afford butter. It creams with sugar fairly nicely, and if you bake something like cookies, they tend not to spread as much when baking as the margarine holds up a bit better. However, in my opinion margarine does have a somewhat bad taste, and I could tell the difference.<br><br>
You could always try baking with vegetable shortening or butter-flavored Crisco. Just keep in mind that heat-processed vegetable fats can be unhealthy, so moderation is key. I've also had success baking with a combination of real butter and shortening.<br><br>
One more thing. I used to make lots of spice cookies and desserts (think gingerbread, pumpkin spice, gingersnaps etc) with shortening or margarine because the spices overpowered the taste of the margarine, so no one could tell at all!<br><br>

Credit: Chocolate Covered Katie<br>
Posted by: Claudia (vapereon5)<br><br>
Also thanks for all the baking tips lol! I recently made sweet potato brownies and oh my gosh they were so good.<br><br>
Straight from another blog, but here it is:<br><br>
3/4 cup sweet potato puree<br>
1 cup peanut or almond butter<br>
1 tsp vanilla extract<br>
1/4 cup + 2 tbsp flour<br>
1/2 cup mini chocolate chips<br>
2/3 cup sugar<br>
1/4 cup + 2 tbsp cocoa powder<br>
1 1/2 tsp baking soda<br>
A bit of salt<br><br>
Instructions <br>
Preheat oven to 325 F. Line an 8-inch pan with parchment paper or grease well. Gently heat your nut butter until easily stir-able. Then whisk it together with the sweet potato and vanilla extract in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, stir together all remaining ingredients – make sure that baking soda is evenly incorporated! Pour dry into wet (not the other way around), and smooth into the prepared pan, scooping out all traces of batter and using a second sheet of parchment to really smooth it down evenly. Bake on the center oven rack 20 minutes. It will look a little underdone, but it firms up as it cools. (If, for some reason, yours is still too gooey after cooling, loosely cover and let it sit in the fridge a few hours.)<br><br>
Mmmhhhh so good<br><br>
You really dont taste the sweet potato! They taste like normal brownies, just really moist and nice from the potato

I have a delicious recipe for you! Translated it out of Dutch so I don't know the exact names of some stuff XD<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
200 ml of cream (the kind you can whip into whipped cream)<br>
125 gram crystal sugar<br>
1 vanilla bean or any other type of flavouring<br><br>
Mix these in a pan and heat until the sugar has dissolved.
Cool to room temperature.<br>
125 gram of butter. whip it into a smooth mixture and slowly add the above cream mixture. Mix it for 10 min into a smooth creamy mass. (yes, it will take a while and look like you messed up until it finally smoothens)<br><br>
Put into a piping bag and squeeze dots onto a baking tray lined with baking paper. (make sure it's a tray that fits your freezer)<br>
Freeze for 3-4 hours.<br><br>
3 baggies of ready made chocolate glazing, the kind you have to melt in hot water for 10 min and turns crunchy hard when set.<br>
put that into a bowl one by one as you go so they dont cool too fast.<br>
one bowl of chocolate sprinkles or cocoa powder.<br><br>

Another easy recipe: melt one chocolate bar, as dark as you can stand. Mix with one well smushed avocado. Chill for 20 mins, then roll into bite-sized truffles and dip in cocoa powder. Very quick dessert for one or many :)<br><br>

Beijinho de coco is the coconut version.<br><br><b>Beijinho de Coco</b><br>
Credit: Panelinha<br><br>
Preparation time: Up to 1 hour<br>
Servings: 23<br><br>
INGREDIENTS<br><br>
* 1 can of condensed milk (395 g)<br>
* 1 cup shredded coconut (about 80 g)<br>
* 1/3 cup of milk<br>
* 1 tablespoon of butter<br>
* a little extra butter to grease your hands<br>
* 23 cloves, for decoration<br><br>
PREPARATION<br><br>
1. Place the condensed milk, milk and butter in a small saucepan and put on low heat. Stir with a silicone spatula until the butter melts.<br><br>
2. Add 1/2 cup of the grated coconut and continue stirring for about 20 minutes, until the candy thickens, at the point of rolling/curling - stir by scraping the bottom and side of the pan well with the spatula so as not to burn. Attention: slightly tilt the pan to check - the mixture should unstick from the bottom of the pan.<br><br>
3. Transfer the mixture to a bowl or plate and let it cool completely to room temperature before rolling.<br><br>
4. Prepare 23 candy cups (size 5) / mini cupcake liners on a tray. Place the rest of the grated coconut in a bowl.<br><br>
5. To shape the beijinho: grease your hands with a little butter, using a spoon, scoop some of the cooled beijinho mixture into your hands and roll into a ball. Roll in the shredded coconut, covering the entire surface. Place the candy in the candy cups/liners and stick with a clove in the top. Repeat with the rest.<br><br>
NOTE: Do not eat the clove. It's safe to consume, but may be hard to chew.<br><br>

Notes from dumpling 1/11/20<br><br>
These are fun to make. They're tasty, but the flavor is basically... condensed milk + coconut :P I recommend putting more coconut inside the mixture or a spice of some sort. I think the chocolate version - traditional brigadeiros (see recipe above) - would have that extra flavor punch. Definitely let them chill before serving so they're not too soft. They keep in the fridge for at least 1-2 weeks. Overall nice treat!<br><br>
Note: The ones in the pic look small bc I started rolling the mixture before laying out the cups and miscalculated the size ^^; Nice and bite-sized though! I need smaller cups :P<br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/qi8cqkzwdp8xuh3/BeijinhodeCoco-1.JPG" width="200"><br><i><font size="2">(To view full pic, drag and drop the image into your browser's address line or right click and open image in a new tab.)</font></i><br><br>

<br><b>Chocolate Ganache<br>
(Chocolate dipping sauce for fruit &amp; grahams!)</b><br>
Posted by: dumpling (dumpling130)<br><br>
Have you tried making chocolate ganache at home? It's super easy and perfect for dipping strawberries, bananas, marshmallows, graham cra-ckers, etc. Just melt some of your favorite chocolate in the microwave (stir every 15 sec) and mix in a bit of cream (or milk of choice + a little butter) until smooth. Add it 1-2 tsp at a time. You can make it as thick or liquidy as you like. Omnomnom :3<br><br>
Leftovers can go in the fridge and be reheated in the microwave later (again, stir every 15 sec). The texture may be weird at first, but do the same thing as before and it'll become smooth again - stir, add a bit of milk/cream, repeat to desired consistency.<br><br>
Thicker ganache is great for topping cakes, brownies, etc.<br><br>
Adding a tip (Mar 18) - <br>
Do not let water come in contact with the melted chocolate! It'll make it seize and get that weird clumpy texture. It's fixable with more milk/cream. If you're dipping strawberries or other fruits, make sure they're dry. If you want to get fancy, you can also add a bit of a flavored extract, but mix it with the milk first just in case. I tried adding rose water once and, well, it's water, so by the time the texture became smooth again, the rose flavor was diluted. (Rose extract should work though!)

<br><b>Simple Pudding (Vanilla, Chocolate) (No Eggs)</b><br>
Posted by: dumpling130<br><br>
This is a simple, light pudding that is very easy to make and customize. I made it without eggs yolks, but you can add them if you like it creamier/richer. If you're feeling under the weather, this is a great dessert to lift your spirits and relieve a sore throat :)<br><br><table border="1"><tr><td>Vanilla</td><td>Chocolate</td></tr><tr><td>
2 cups milk (or plant milk)<br><br>
1/4 - 1/3 cup white sugar<br>
3 Tbsp cornstarch<br>
1/4 tsp salt<br><br><br>
1 tsp vanilla extract<br>

<td>
2 cups milk (or plant milk)<br><br>
1/3 cup sugar**<br>
2 Tbsp cornstarch<br>
1/8 tsp salt<br>

1 tsp vanilla extract<br>
1 Tbsp butter<br>
3-4 oz (85-115g) finely chopped dark chocolate*<br></td></tr><tr><td>

* Chocolate: If the chocolate is on the dark side (66-70%), use less. If it's less so (50-60%), use more.<br>
** Sugar: Eating it cold? Use more sugar. Hot? Less sugar. <br><br>
INSTRUCTIONS:<br><br>
1. Whisk the dry together. The cornstarch is clumpy, so add a little bit of the milk to make a paste, then add the rest.<br><br>
2. Heat in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly and scraping the sides and bottom of the saucepan.<br><br>
3. Continue to cook and stir until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a metal spoon. Do not boil.<br><br>
4. Turn off the heat and stir in vanilla, butter, and chocolate (if using — it should melt in the hot mixture, but if it doesn't, just heat for another minute).<br><br>
5. Divide into serving dishes. Enjoy warm or cold. Chill for 2 hrs to set. Refrigerate up to 3 days.<br><br>
If adding eggs:<br>
@ Step 4 - When it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, let it cool a bit, then whisk in 2 egg yolks and continue cooking &amp; stirring until it was thick enough that it divided to show a streak of the bottom of the pot when stirred.

<br><b>Creme Caramel</b><br>
Posted by: dumpling (dumpling130)<br><br>
This is one of the easiest deserts! :*<br><br>
Creme:<br>
1 L of milk (room temperature or slightly warmed)<br>
1 cup sugar<br>
6 eggs<br>
1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)<br><br>
Caramel:<br>
1 cup sugar<br>
2 Tbsp water<br><br>
DIRECTIONS<br><br>
1. Preheat oven to 160 C / 325 F. Prepare 2 baking dishes, any size, as long as one fits into the other with room to spare. (Ideally baking ramekins or 8" dish and a larger 9x13" baking dish.)<br><br>
Caramel:<br>
2. Stir sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat until it dissolves into a honey-colored caramel. The minute it dissolves, take it off the heat. Do not over-cook - it burns quickly. (The caramel is VERY HOT and can burn you! Do not touch it!)<br><br>
3. Pour an even amount into the ramekins / smaller baking dish. It will harden right away. Set aside.<br><br>
Creme:<br>
4. In a large mixing bowl, whisk eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, and warm milk until well-combined. (The milk should be just warm enough to help the sugar dissolve, not hot enough to cook the eggs.)<br><br>
5. Pour the milk mixture over the caramel.<br><br>
Baking:<br>
6. Put the ramekins / smaller dish into the larger dish and fill the larger dish with water until half full. This is called a bain-marie, French for water bath.<br><br>
7. Bake for about 1 hour, until the top is light golden brown.<br><br>
8. To serve:  If using ramekins, place a serving plate upside down on top of the ramekin, hold tight, flip over and gently lift the ramekin.<br><br>
Bon appetit! :*<br><br>
NOTES:<br><br>
If your creme is not smooth and has bubbles in it, the oven temperature was too high. Try 150 C / 300 F. (It will still be perfectly edible.)<br><br>
If you would like to cut down the sugar, reduce to 1.5 cups total.<br><br>
We usually make it in an 8x8" square baking dish or oven-proof glass bowl with a 9x13" dish for the water bath. Then just scoop out the desert into a small serving bowl and spoon the caramel on top. It disappears quickly so we don't bother with presentation 0:-)

<br><b>Pudding Fruit Salad</b><br>
Posted by: Aleisha (aka Lei) (invaderlei)<br><br>
Hi! It's super late, but I keep seeing this board and maybe I should join? I only have one recipe, and it's my mom's special "healthy" fruiy salad made with pudding and tooti-frootie marshmallows! Though we mostly use three fruits. oranges, pineapples and cherries!<br><br>
There's also our fudge dipped cake pops that we tried last year made with a most chocolate cake mix. :)<br><br>
I'd have to get the exacts to be able to put the info for you guys. It's very informative and makes me hungry... at 3 am. *lol*<br><br>
Okay! I found a version of what my mom makes, but feel free to add your own fruits you'd think would be good. I think strawberries would fit into the naturally sweet taste if you don't want to add the marshmallows, but you don't know what you're missing. :P<br>
~ ~ ~<br>
Pudding Fruit Salad!<br><br>
1 container (4 oz) refrigerated vanilla pudding, packaged bought or you can make your own pudding if you'd like!<br><br>
1/2 cup Cool Whip frozen whipped topping, thawed<br><br>
1 cup miniature marshmallows, regular is fine but I find the tootie frootie marshmallows work best, if you want the marshmallows that is.<br><br>
1 can (11 oz) mandarin orange segments, drained<br><br>
1 can (8 oz) pineapple tidbits in juice, drained<br><br>
and one jar of cherries, drained and sliced.<br><br>
Makes a good side dish for family reunions, potluck gatherings and a nice scoop of fruit salad would go nicely with some pie after thanksgiving dinner! don't be a dummy like me and get a scoop when you have plate full of gravy soaked mash potatoes and turkey. X'D<br><br>
It takes about refrigerator time around maybe an hour to an hour and 30 minutes. :3<br><br>

<br><b>The Lazy-Person's Pudding<br>
(with Tapioca Pearl Topping)</b><br>
Posted by: Julia (faulse_wolfe)<br><br>
Currently cooking instant tapioca pearls :D can't find the black ones, these are white but I trust these will still give that chewy texture when eaten :P<br><br>
Apart from milk tea, I was looking for other desserts to mix with the tapioca pearls and I found out it can be eaten with pudding. So I looked for an easy pudding recipe. All recipes I found needed egg yolks but I'm a lazy person and don't see myself separating the yolks *lol**lol* so I made my own recipe w whole eggs *lol**heart*<br><br>
I call this one the Lazy-person's Pudding *lol*<br><br>
In a pot, dissolve 1/2 cup of cornstarch and a pinch of salt in 4 cups of milk. Stir in 1 cup of light corn syrup and 3 large whole eggs. Bring to a boil, while constantly whisking (because you'll notice the egg whites won't mix in at first but by good whisking, it will eventually haha) :D tale it out of the heat once it thickens and voila!<br><br>
You now made a pudding :D just stir in a spoon of vanilla extract and about 2 spoons of butter to make it smooth if you like (that's what I did), chill, and serve (I don't have patience so I ate some already XD)<br><br>
Also, I used cornsyrup here because it has been sitting in my pantry for so long. I imagine using a cup of white sugar would be just as good :D<br><br>
Uploaded a pic of it in (petpage - see below!) :D:D<br><br>
Another note: it's better to transfer the pudding in your serving glasses before chilling because it won't be as pretty if you transfer it after it has cooled :)<br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/lxj8o0tselyfozn/20210127_Julia_Tapioka_Pudding.jpg" width="200"><br><i><font size="2">(To view full pic, drag and drop the image into your browser's address line or right click and open image in a new tab.)</font></i>

<br><b>Chocolate Oat Pudding (No Eggs, Cornstarch)</b><br>
Credit: Real Food Real Deals<br><br>
I have no idea how I stumbled upon this originally, but I just found it in my notes the other day and tried it on a whim and it's amazing! It's just like normal pudding, but without the heavy cream, sugar, cornstarch, cooking, waiting, etc. See the NOTES below for tea flavor versions.<br><br>
TOOLS:<br>
Blender<br>
Saucepan<br>
Serving cups<br><br>
INGREDIENTS:<br><br>
For 4 servings, per original recipe:<br><br>
3/4 cup rolled oats<br>
1/3 cup pure maple syrup (or honey, agave, etc)<br>
2 1/4 cups coconut milk or other milk * +<br>
1/4 cup cocoa powder<br><br>
(TIP: +6 Tbsp milk for creamier texture)<br>
(TIP: +1 Tbsp instant coffee, optional)<br><br>
INSTRUCTIONS:<br><br>
1. Put everything in a blender and blend very well for 1 min - gradually go up to high for 30 sec and blend on high for 30 sec.<br><br>
2. Transfer to small saucepan. Cook on medium heat for 2-5 min, until thick, whisking constantly.<br><br>
3. Spoon into serving cups immediately - it firms up fast!<br><br>
4. Enjoy right away or refrigerate for 1 hr for a chilled pudding. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for a few days.<br><br>
…<br><br>
I'm the only one at home who likes chocolate pudding, so I scaled it down for just one portion, about 1 espresso cup:<br><br>
1/4 cup rolled oats (~4 tbsp)<br>
1.5-2 Tbsp maple syrup<br>
3/4 cup milk * +<br>
1.5 Tbsp cocoa powder<br><br>
(TIP: +2 Tbsp milk for creamier texture)<br>
(TIP: +1 tsp (1/3 Tbsp) instant coffee, optional)<br><br>
Blend very well for 1 min. Cook on medium heat, whisking constantly, for about 2 min. Serve!<br><br>
…<br><br>
NOTES:<br><br>
* Milk: Avoid homemade oat milk. I tried this and the texture was a bit slimy. Store-bought oat and other nut milks are fine. Using regular cow milk makes for a richer/creamier pudding.<br><br>
+ Using the written amount will produce a firmer, jello-like pudding. If you like a creamier texture, as I do, add a bit more milk. +2 Tbsp for one portion / +6 Tbsp for 4 servings. Delish!<br><br>
TIP: Add a bit of instant coffee to the blender. Coffee enhances the flavor of cocoa. +1 tsp for one portion / +1 Tbsp for 4 servings.<br><br>
CHAI / EARL GREY TEA VERSION: This pudding works really well with Chai or Earl Grey tea, instead of cocoa. Heat up the milk in the microwave or saucepan, stirring so it doesn't burn. Add ~1 tea bag per portion, cover and steep for 5-10 min. Proceed to make the pudding as usual. Top with chopped nuts if desired. (Earl Grey &amp; chocolate is a popular combo which may work well here, but I haven't tried it yet.) (I tried steeping Darjeeling and regular black tea, but was not impressed.)<br><br>
OTHER VERSIONS: I tried 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and honey instead of cocoa and maple syrup. The oat flavor came through and it tasted similar to Oatly's original flavor ice cream (maybe we're onto something here... :))<br><br>
...<br><br>
If you'd like a more traditional chocolate pudding recipe, check out NYT's Dark Chocolate Pudding. It is a little more work, but not too difficult and sooo good. I actually got heavy cream to make it recently, but then I found this and I like easy and healthy sooo.. Another time :P

Tip from dumpling (dumpling130) (9/10)<br><br>
This was really interesting... The texture was more like a custard than a pudding, even though I put less honey (1/2 cup = 8 Tbsp, a bit too much for me). I like custard, so I don't really mind. The cocoa flavor comes through very well! ...And so does the tofu ^^;; After a while, one gets used to it, but I'm wondering if there's a way to tone down the tofu flavor. Maybe adding in the right amount of honey? Will check in with mtnmoth and experiment!<br></div>

Posted by: dumpling<br><br>
The original recipe is from my 8th grade home economics class and is designed for five people, so feel free to enlist helpers! :)<br><br>
INGREDIENTS<br><br>
5 Apples*<br>
1/2 cup butter (a bit melted)<br>
1/2 cup brown sugar (sub: coconut sugar, etc)<br>
1 tsp cinnamon (to taste)<br>
3/4 cup oats<br>
1/2 cup flour<br><br>
*NOTE: Any type of apples or a mix will work. Granny Smith bake really well bc they're firmer and will retain their shape, but we use whatever we have on hand. Depending on the size of the apples, you may want to use a larger baking pan and double the topping, especially if you like extra crisp.<br><br>
INSTRUCTIONS<br><br>
1. Wash hands and put on apron. Lightly grease an 8 x 8 x 2-inch baking pan. If baking same day, preheat oven to 350 F.<br><br>
2. Mix all ingredients except apples in a large mixing bowl. It will be sticky. (Beating the butter and sugar together first, then folding in the dry ingredients may make it fluffier, but we usually just mix everything together.)<br><br>
3. Wash, peel, core, slice apples in 1/4-inch thick slices. Layer neatly in the pan.<br><br>
4. Spread the butter mixture evenly over the apples. Cover and refrigerate overnight. (We usually bake straight away and it's great.)<br><br>
5. Bake mixture for 1 hour at 350 F. <br><br>
6. Enjoy!

Posted by: Kate (_kattitude)<br><br>
My favorite recipe is for Reese's Peanut Butter Pie:<br><br>
With an electric mixer, beat together 8 ox of cream cheese and 1 cup of peanut butter until fluffy. Mix in 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, 1 cup of half &amp; half, and 1 tsp of vanilla and beat until smooth. By hand, fold in 1 cup of chopped Reese's peanut butter cups and 8 oz of whipped cream. Mix well and spread evenly in the pie crust. Chill (in the freezer) for at least two hours. Also, this recipe will fill two 8 inch pie crusts.<br><br>

<br><b>Cinnamon Rolls</b><br>
Posted by: Natalie (pittpens872955)<br><br>
I have a lovely cinnamon roll recipe but it's absolutely massive D:<br><br>
(Difficult?) I don't think it's too bad, they just require a lot of ingredients is all and is a decent amount of steps lol<br><br>
oh wait actually i had put on it on a petpage for my guild! I had totally forgotten haha<br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Dephei#mug">//www.neopets.com/~Dephei#mug</a><br><br>
So here's the recipe, the photos are mine when I did it for the first time (:<br><br>
My bday is next month so my plan is to eat super healthy this month then make cinnamon rolls to start my birthday month *lol*<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><i>Recipe copied over from PP above just in case.<br>

~ ~ ~<br><br>
Honestly these cinnamon rolls are better than cinnabon in my opinion...<br><br><img src="http://imgur.com/LAPzwSN.png" width="199"> ~ <img src="http://imgur.com/llJXCU4.png" width="265"><br><br>
For the Dough:<br>
1 cup scalded whole milk<br>
1/2 cup unsalted butter<br>
1/3 cup granulated sugar<br>
2 1/2 teaspoons dry active yeast (or 1 packet)<br>
2 large eggs<br>
4 cups all-purpose flour (plus additional as needed)<br>
2 teaspoon salt<br><br>
For the Cinnamon Roll Filling:<br>
1 cup brown sugar packed<br>
1/2 cup unsalted butter softened<br>
2 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon<br>
3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br><br>
For the Cream Cheese Frosting:<br>
1/2 cup cream cheese softened<br>
1/2 cup unsalted butter softened<br>
2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>
2 cups powdered sugar<br><br><br>
Instructions<br><br>
For the Dough:<br><br>
Set the butter, eggs and cream cheese out to warm to room temperature. Place the milk in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil. The moment it reaches a boil, remove from heat. (This is so important, Don't skip!) Pour the hot milk into the bowl and with an electric mixer and add 1/2 cup butter, to bring the temperature down. Stir and allow the butter to melt completely. Then stir in the sugar. Touch the milk mixture to test the temperature. It should be close to luke warm - just above room temp. If it is not, add 1/2 cup flour and test again. Once it is just above room temperature, stir in the yeast and let it foam for approximately 10 minutes.<br><br>
Place the bread hook on the mixer (or just use a wooden spoon if you don't have an electric mixer)and turn on low. Add the eggs, salt, and remaining flour up to 4 cups. Knead the dough until it pulls away from the sides. Run the mixer for approximately 10 minutes to allow the dough to stretch and develop the gluten. If the dough seems too sticky after the first 2-3 minutes add an additional 1/4 cup flour. After 10 minutes, turn the mixer off. Cover the top with plastic, and allow the dough to rise until double in size, approximately 60-90 minutes in a warm kitchen.<br><br>
For the Cinnamon Roll Filling:<br><br>
Mix the brown sugar, softened butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg until smooth. Keep at room temperature until ready to use. Dump the inflated dough out on a well-floured work surface. Fold into thirds and press flat. Then turn and fold into thirds again and press into a rectangle. Roll the rectangle out into a large 16 X 20 inch sheet.<br><br>
Spread the cinnamon filling over the sheet into a thin layer. Leave 1 1/2 inches bare (cinnamon-free) on one long edge. Be careful not to gouge holes in the dough. Starting at the cinnamon-covered long edge, roll the dough sheet tightly toward the uncovered edge to form a long tight log. Place a piece of parchment paper in a 9 X 13 inch baking dish. Then cut the log into 12 equal rolls.(an unflavored pieces of dental floss will work wonders for this) Tuck the loose end under each roll to secure it, and place them in the baking dish to rise.<br><br>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Allow the rolls to rise for at least 30 minutes while the oven heats. Then bake for 20-25 minutes, until the edges are barely golden and the center of each roll is puffed high up.<br><br>
For the Cream Cheese Frosting:<br><br>
While the rolls are in the oven, beat the cream cheese, butter, vanilla, and powdered sugar together until completely smooth. The moment the rolls come out of the oven gently spread half the glaze over the tops and allow it to seep down into the cra.cks. Five minutes later, add more glaze if desired. Serve warm or at room temperature.

<br><b>Filipino-style Avocado Dessert</b><br>
Posted by: Julia (faulse_wolfe)<br><br>
Avocado with powdered milk and sugar is the best! Just cut it, remove seed and mix right there, no need for bowls. When I was a kid and found they were put in foods in western countries, I was weirded out by it haha<br><br>
(Is the powder milk + sugar common in Phillipines?)<br>
-<br>
This is the only way it's eaten here XD haha jk okay not "the only" but ask anybody here and they'd probs say this is the best combi<br><br>
I also enjoy avocado shake which is the same ingredients but with ice and blended into a smoothie but not in pudding cups like you mentioned haha that would be too small for me
<br><br>

Comments from dumpling:<br><br>
In Taiwan, avocado is blended into a smoothie with milk + one of those supermarket pudding cups (also a common topping in bubble tea) + ice to taste = "avocado milk<br><br>
The pudding provides the sweetness and adds to the smooth texture. Sounds like you have something similar. Avo + milk is a veryyyy strange combination in the US xD; Healthy ice creams, including those made with avocado, are on the rise, though :)<br><br>

Comment from Dumpling (May 5, 2023):<br>
This is divine! ♡ I made it for some friends, and unexpectedly some strangers as well, and everyone loved it! The recipe is very forgiving. Melt the butter (I used 1 stick = 1/2 cup) and set aside to cool a bit. Whisk the dry. Whisk the wet. Combine the dry and wet, whisk, then slowly add the butter and whisk well. (You cannot overmix.) I sprinkled it with 1/2 cup shredded coconut before baking. It's difficult to cut when still warm, so make sure you give it 1-2 hrs to cool down. Dreaming of Hawaii... :)<br><br>

<br><b>TIP: Dark Chocolate Brands</b><br><br>
Tip from Dumpling (dumpling130)<br><br>
Just ordered seven bars of chocolate from Raaka :3<br><br>
For any fans of (very) dark chocolate, check them out! Fantastic chocolate from a sustainable brand.<br><br>
I first found their bars in a secluded corner of a specialty choco shop ~5 years ago. Now you can find their mini bars at Whole Foods! Love how they have grown. Note: Order directly from their website if you can; a bit overpriced in stores/Amz.<br><br>
Pacari is another great bean-to-bar brand. Their rose chocolate is delicious! They've expanded their Amz selection recently, but the prices fluctuate, so always check their website to make sure you get a good deal. I've ordered from them before and the choco came in a sturdy cardboard box with ice packs to keep it from melting! I mean, these people care :D<br><br>
...<br><br>
I ordered chocolate from Raaka only a few days ago and they just added two bars that are left over from last month's subscriptions to the regular side! ;_;<br><br>
Strawberry Basil<br>
Orange Mango Mint<br><br>
For the record, I don't know how it is in chocolate, but strawberry basil ice cream is amazing!! :3<br><br>
So apparently this leftover bar thing is called Second Helpings and it's relatively new. Subscription (First Nibs) flavors are exclusive, but this way subscribers can get a first taste, and leftover bars will be available to anyone. I think they did this quietly a few times over the years, and added some subscription flavors to the regular selection. It's great that they have a plan for it now (:<br><br>
OK Raaka gets A+ for customer service!<br>
I emailed them asking if I can add those two bars to my existing order since it hasn't shipped yet and received a response and updated invoice within 15 min! :D<br><br>
~ ~ ~<br><br>
Tip from Marley (misguided_angel215)<br><br>
Ooh I always support chocolate! I've also found another dark chocolate brand called Taza which I liked! I visited their factory in MA!<br><br>
I'm pretty sure it's also sold at Whole Food so I'd recommend it! It's stone cut so it's a bit more grainy texture, definitely worth a try since I had never had anything like it before <br><br>
(A bit like Mexican chocolate?) Yes, on the tour they shared the co-founder went to South America to learn the chocolate making technique. I ended up getting chocolate-covered macadamia nuts and espresso beans which were so tasty when I visited the factory ^^

These are recipes I came across online_  usually on YT or IG, which didn't work out quite as expected, at least for me.

Just sharing these in case anyone comes across these and is also curious.<br><br><b>Gluten-free Lemon Poppy Seed Loaf by Tasty</b><br><br>
-- The flavor is great, and it turns out as pictured, but just note that it's a so-called wet crumb cake / quick bread, which is very moist, as opposed to the dry fluffy crumbs you get in a typical cake. After a day or two, it kind of congeals and it's not as pleasant to eat texture-wise. It's totally safe to eat and yummy though!<br><br><b>Banana Brownies Recipe (with oats!) by How to Cook Smarter (YooyuTube)</b><br><br>
-- I tried this twice and both times I got fudgy brownies, instead of cake-y brownies like those in the video. Not sure why that happened. Note on flavor: the peanut butter is quite strong. If you like brownies and PB &amp; choco together, you will probably love this. If you're not a big fan, these brownies may be overwhelming. If you use another nut butter, up the cocoa powder.<br><br><b>Healthy Microwave Carrot Cake (with Oats) | Em's Kitchen (YooyuTube)</b><br><br>
