<p>
Welcome to the Official Page of The King Coltzan Society - An exclusive group for those involved in Higher League Battling. Being a part of KCS means you have a higher league pet (1000+ HP, 750+ Strength &amp; 750+ Defense) and are an avid, active battler. While there is plenty to read on this page, its probably best to begin with the basics.
</p><p>
Let me start off by saying that <b>KCS is not a guild</b>. Throughout the year, KCS will host a variety of battling events for those who have signed up. These events will consist of 1-Player &amp; 2-Player events (<b>Please Note</b>: KCS will only host 2-Player events until The Battledome Beta undergoes changes &amp; difficulty increase returns. After those changes, there will be 1-Player &amp; 2-Player events). Details for each event will be explained along with what is expected of each user. There are a general set of rules that all users must follow to be a part of KCS (listed below). With each event, there will be an additional, more detailed, list of rules/guidelines specific for the particular event. There will usually be some activity going on within KCS - Whether its preparation for an event, actual battling or a resting period/new preparation for next event.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/desert/usurper_feast.gif"><br><i>Its important to rest up while you can.</i>
</center>
<p>
The reasoning behind King Coltzan Society is quite simple. With changes that were brought to The Battledome, there has been a large loss of interest in battling. KCS was created to help build some dedication back into Veteran battlers &amp; attract the attention of newcomers. Those who qualify and wish to join will once again be forced to budget themselves, build a strategic set, and use their well trained pets to claim victorious of an event. It is understood that the stat requirements are high but its for good reason. King Coltzan Society is here to help battlers learn &amp; regain the knowledge and strategy for higher league battling.
</p>
<p>
</p><h2>KCS: Is it for you?!</h2>
<p>
I have already discussed the reasoning behind creating KCS; however, is this battling group right for you? That is ultimately the question you will ask yourself.
</p><p>
KCS is for anyone that has a strong interest in battling. Please know that while we require pets to be well trained, that does not mean everyone involved has the most expensive weapons &amp; knows every strategy - Its actually the opposite. Most of the members are here to mix &amp; match weapons, learn strategy and over time build up their set to help improve their power. Of course there are some battlers in KCS that have been around for years and have a well rounded set; however, reach out to those players for advice &amp; tips - I am sure they would be willing to help! KCS should be viewed as a battling system that allows players to increase their talents and continue to show their strategies within every competition. 
</p><p>
Do not be discouraged by thinking you are not good enough. If your pet qualifies and you have an interested, you deserve to have fun so jump in!
</p>

<h1>The Rules</h1>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/randomevents/images/coltzan.png" style="float: right; padding: 5px 10px 0px 5px;"> These rules are to be followed by everyone involved in King Coltzan Society. There are not many and most of them are common sense, but I want to be clear on a few aspects.
<p>
1. Be Kind &amp; Courteous: The Battledome brings out the competitive side of everyone and while this is fun, makes sure to be respectful. 
</p>
<p>
2. Be Honest: Even though it would be tough to do, borrowing pets is not allowed in KCS. Additionally, it may be tough to track and/or prove, but please do not borrow weapons from other users.
</p>
<p>
3. Follow Event Rules: As mentioned before, there will be an additional list of guidelines for each event held by KCS - Please follow them to make battling your fellow members a smooth process. 
</p>
<p>
4. Weapon Restrictions: Battlers may use any/all weapons with the following exceptions:
</p><ul><li> No items which will permanently alter your opponents account (IE: Pet, Items, Sickness etc.). 
</li>
<li>WoDF/IStaff/Blaze: These three weapons can be used; however, battlers cannot use their multi-healing ability. Until more adjustments are made &amp; issues fixed in The Battledome, do not use these three weapons when your HP is low enough for you to heal. If this occurs, the battle should be re-matched.</li> 
<li>SuAP: All participants are allowed to only equip <b>one</b> Super Attack Pea. You cannot use two during a fight and you cannot equip more than one (in case one is stolen). One Super Attack Pea ONLY; however, you may additionally use a Seasonal Attack Pea or a normal Attack Pea. </li> 
<li>Thrown Slushie Cup: If you wish to use this in battle, please remember that freezers are limited to one. Although this weapon allows you to equip other freezers, limit yourself to one, with this item being included. Either user another freeing item or one of these items - No combinations! </li> 
<li>Thyoras Tear &amp; Thick Smoke Bomb: Players may only use one or the other during battle - Not both.</li>
</ul><p>
5. Faerie Abilities: All abilities can be used with the following exceptions:
<br></p><ul><li>The following abilities are BANNED: Lens Flare, Rejuvenate, Throw Pillows &amp; ALL Level 200 and 500 Abilities.</li>
</ul><p>
6. No Ties: If a battle results in a tie, it does not count and should be re-matched. </p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Freezing: ALLOWED (per battlers)</h2>
<p>
Freezing is currently not working properly; however, KCS is going to allow battlers to use them in battle as long as both parties agree to it. If agreed to freeze, all weapons under that category can be used; however, when a freeze occurs, the opponent must respect the freeze and not use any weapons/abilities that round. If it is decided to not use freezing weapons, then neither battler can use weapons that can freeze (this includes Sword of Lameness). 
</p><p>
Even though we are using the "respect the freeze" rule, let me explain how freezing currently works so you are aware for battles outside of KCS: 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/battledome/icons/snowflake_icon.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/battledome/icons/snowflake_icon.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/battledome/icons/snowflake_icon.gif"></center>
<p>
In the past, a player could use a freezing weapon and their opponent was automatically unable to use weapons for the following round - This is currently not the case. If a battler decides to use a freezing item, <b>you must make a move first the following round</b> in order for the freeze to be effective. If Player 1 uses a freezer in round 1, that means Player 1 <b>must</b> pick their weapons, ability &amp; click "FIGHT!" before your opponent does. Completing this successfully will result in your opponent being frozen that round. If Player 2 were to click "FIGHT!" first then the freeze is unsuccessful. Note - Even if the freeze is unsuccessful, you will not be able to have a second attempt. It is not known if this is intentional by Neopets Team or a simple glitch but will keep you updated if &amp; when information is learned.

<h1>KCS Brackets</h1>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/template_images/scorchio_green_flex.gif" width="50" height="50">One of the main focal points of King Coltzan Society is to allow players to use their strongest pet that has endured long &amp; tough training. Since we dont require exact stats and many battlers continue to train, we see quite a variety of maximum HP Neopets. While this does keep it fun &amp; creative for all with a variety of pets, it creates a problem. There must be a system put in place to help organize such variety to allow for a fair playing field. To facilitate fair battles &amp; scores, KCS has created a bracket system which can be seen below.
<p></p>
<center>
<style type="text/css">

<th>I</th>
<th>II</th>
<th>III</th>
<th>IV</th>
<th>V</th>
<th>VI</th>
<th>VII</th>
<th>VIII</th>
<th>IX</th>
<th>X</th>
</tr><tr><td>Maximum HP</td>
<td>1000 - 1200</td>
<td>1201 - 1400</td>
<td>1401 - 1600</td>
<td>1601 - 1800</td>
<td>1801 - 2000</td>
<td>2001 - 2500</td>
<td>2501 - 3000</td>
<td>3000 - 4000</td>
<td>4000 - 5000</td>
<td>5000+</td>
</tr></table></center>
<p>
</p>
<h1>KCS Scoring</h1>
<p>
We use what I call a "Base Ten" scoring system. This ultimately allows everyone to battle one another outside their brackets and the winner would receive 10 points plus or minus a handicap from the bracket difference. Here are some examples to help clarify:
</p><p>
</p><ul><li>Bracket 7 Neopet defeats Bracket 3 Neopet, the winner receives 6 points.</li>
<li>Bracket 6 Neopet defeats Bracket 4 Neopet, the winner receives 8 points.</li>
<li>Bracket 5 Neopet defeats Bracket 5 Neopet, the winner receives 10 points.</li>
<li>Bracket 4 Neopet defeats Bracket 6 Neopet, the winner receives 12 points.</li>
<li>Bracket 3 Neopet defeats Bracket 7 Neopet, the winner receives 14 points.</li>
</ul><p>
Ultimately the winner of any battle will receive ten points - If there is a difference in brackets, the winner has to add the difference to 10 if they are in a lower bracket or subtract the difference from 10 if they are in a higher bracket. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Minimum Points Awarded</b>: To help balance out points amongst brackets, there is a minimum point limit of 3 awarded, never any lower. If Bracket X defeats Bracket I, II or III, the Bracket X pet will receive 3 points per battle, not 1, 2, and 3.

I know life is difficult and if you are unable to battle for a period of time, please notify me/mention on the threads. If you challenge someone but do not hear back in over 5 days, please notify me and penalty points shall be given. The challenger will <b>not</b> receive points.<br>
3. Sword of Lameness allowed as long as freezing is agreed to amongst battlers. <br>
4. Warlocks Rage and Lens Flare are <b>banned</b> for this competition. They may not be used under any situation and if so, the battle should be rematched.
