<br><br><b>This is the story of how someone impersonated me on external buying/selling sites and how I failed to convince support of my innocence.</b>

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/pets/angry/aisha_grey_baby.gif"><br><br>

I used to be the user thyaen, my sides were yorinth, aeryth, routhay, lykket.<br><br>
On the 12th of May I suddenly got locked out of all my accounts. Friends contacted me to tell me that I was frozen.<br><br>
What had happened? <br>
My first ticket, written directly on the 12th of May, wondering why I got frozen, brought this reply:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ScJUP8F.png" width="700"><br><br>
My reply, consisting of shock and despair, asking why they would accuse me of that, brought this reply:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/53XRCxB.png" width="700"><br><br>
I spent the next days collecting all my UC trading data (which pets I had traded with whom, based on which previous NM communication, on what date), describing everything I had spent my time on Neopets with these last weeks, showing screenshots of trading communication (offering pets, seeking specific pets for specific people), giving a history of my NC purchases and asking why I should have bought NC if I was trying to get money out of Neopets. <br>
None of this was read, as I eventually got this reply, nearly a week later:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/RM5CuPX.png" width="700"><br><br>
I summed up everything I had written to Tony and created a new ticket with that, asking for Alice. That was her first reply:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/McxLOpr.png" width="700"><br><br>
I begged her to at least READ my mail, and got this reply:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zg5Gol8.png" width="700"><br><br>
Having come from 'we WON'T unfreeze' to 'we CAN'T unfreeze' I asked her for more details (why she only ever spoke in singular, and which exact post had brought me the freezing) and got this:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EPB1Qs5.png" width="700"><br><br>
I created four new tickets for my sides, got them assigned, but never heard back.<br><br>
Searching through the site Tony had named me in his second reply I eventually found why I had been frozen. <br>Someone, having been registered on that site since 2017, had started a new board...<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Mm9RatU.png" width="700"><br><br>
... and inserted a copy &amp; paste of a post I had left on the PC's UC Trading Board, complete with board signature and the polite 'Thank you for the board':<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xBOeKUH.png" width="700"><br><br>
I mailed this find to Alice, astonished how support could seriously think that this was me, and arguing how that person's posting (searching/offering) history on that site didn't fit with any activity on my accounts at all.<br>
I didn't hear back.<br><br>
Some days later a friend put my username 'thyaen' and 'neopets' into poogle search and found this:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cDB6eo7.png" width="700"><br><br>
I mailed this to Alice as well, but again didn't hear back.<br><br>
Nearly two weeks later I inquired in the Highway to Help board and got this reply:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JfVnPHP.png" width="700"><br><br>
By that point an acquaintance of mine, an attorney working in the fields of cyber criminality, had told me that Identity Theft actually was a crime. <br><br>
Having gotten yet another ticket closed I finally filed a report at my local police department and wrote a new ticket:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/RrAts7h.png" width="700"><br><br>
This is the reply I got:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/D8nuKk4.png" width="700"><br><br>
These last few weeks, forced by the situation, I did a lot of research about proxy, VPN, IPs and how practically anyone can do anything on the internet without leaving a trace. <br>So both Tony and I know that the police probably won't get any results. <br>
We also know that it's impossible for me to prove that I didn't do any of the things I am accused of. However much data I provide them with (bank account statements, browser history, etc) I could always simply leave information out.<br><br>
I have been active nearly daily since December 2010. <br>I was a paying premium member for the last 5 or so years.<br> I occasionally bought NC.<br> I have always played by Neopets' rules. <br><br>
I was targeted by someone for a reason unknown to me, framed, and TNT did them the favor of freezing without asking any questions, without listening to my arguments, without even considering I may not be guilty. <br><br>
It can't truly be that easy to get anyone frozen permanently, can it?<br><br><hr><hr><br><i>At this point I went to the neoboards and made my case public. Reactions ranged from shocked to furious. How could anyone ever feel safe with their accounts, pets and neocash if anyone could take it from them, any time? The following uproar on- and offsite, hundreds of users canceling premium and stating to not buy any NC until there was some kind of statement from TNT rescued me.</i><br><br><hr><hr><br><br><b>Update, 7th of June!!</b><br><br>
I woke up to these mails from Tony:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JGkHDRV.png" width="700"><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fpWpgjX.png" width="700"><br><br>
You all are my heroes. Thank you for your thoughts, your words, your actions, your support.<br><br>
Thanks to you I got my accounts back - and we got a precedence. Please let's keep working together on support finding a way to actually communicate with us, instead of simply freezing and never listening to our words and proof.<br>
This is the happiest beginning I could imagine for myself. But it's still just a beginning.<br><br>
unbridledlove/Monty created a petition to keep things rolling:<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Lola"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nLJaOhi.gif"></a><br>
Please sign, tell your story, and let us all change the way TNT handles freezings.<br><br><b>Update 2, 7th of June</b><br><br>
7 minutes after finally replying to Tony's mail I got this reply:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7DGImWC.png" width="700"><br><br>
I am thankful to have my accounts back, for Tony's words, and for all of your energy, words and actions. Thank you so much.<br><br><hr><hr><br><b>Afterthought</b><br><br>
A kind person had brought my case to the attention of a moderator on one of the external selling sites: <br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LAzbVzs.png" width="700"><br>
The moderator's reply left no doubts:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JZedzar.png" width="700"><br><br>
I forwarded this to Tony P. I don't know whether he or the police took further actions.<br><br></font></div></center><BR><BR><BR>
