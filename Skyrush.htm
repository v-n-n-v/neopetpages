Hello, hello~ Welcome to <i>Skyrush</i>, a site dedicated to providing templates. As templates these layouts will have either greys or plain colors as a color scheme. I've chosen to do templates instead of premades because I want to encourage people to customize these pages*. Just remember to not delete the credit! 
<br><br>
If you have any questions at all about editing or just coding in general, please don't hesistate to ask! I'm also open to suggestions for more layouts. You can mail me on my main <a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=kloofe">here</a>.
<br><br>
*While these are templates, tampering with some of the widths/heights/positioning/etc might mess up the layouts if you don't completely understand what you're changing and how it will affect the layout ^^;
<br><br><div class="updates">
1/26/2024 - Wow :') Dunno how many of these still work but leaving it up and will see if I can fix any

<div class="box1">
Most of the things you would want to change come <i>after</i> <b>.boxPair a img</b> in the stylesheet. 
<br><br>
If you want to change the color of the menu triangle side things, you'll need to change the border colors in <b>.side1</b> and <b>.side2</b> in the stylesheet. For .side1, change:
<br><br><center>
<b>border-right: 50px solid #2E2E2E;</b>
<br><br>
to
<br><br><b>border-right: 50px solid #COLORHERE;</b>
</center>
<br>
For .side2, change the border colors for the left-borders. If you want to change the color of the menu, change the background under <b>#menu</b> to whatever color you want. To mess around with the font style of the menu links, go to <b>#menu a</b> or <b>#menu a:hover</b>.

<h1>Title One</h1>
<div class="box1">
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
<br><br>
The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

<h1>My Art Page</h1>

<div class="text">
Enter the story of your art life here.
<br><br>
To save the code, press tab until you see www.neopets.com/~Skyrush in the lower corner of your browser. Press tab one more time and then press your enter key.
<br><br>
Things that you may want to edit (ie colors) are located after <b>#menu</b>. If you want to change the background of this white box, then you have to change the background color of both <b>.inner</b> and <b>.infobox</b> to the same color.
<br><br>
To add images within a section:
<br><br>
‹div class="box"›‹img src="imgURLHERE" class="small"›<br>
‹div class="inner" style="position: fixed;"›‹img src="imgURLHERE"›‹/div›<br>
‹/div›
<br><br>
Make sure you don't just copy and paste that code as the ‹› are not actual angle brackets. You must use actual angle brackets. The two image urls should also be the same image ^^;
<br><br>
If your image is too wide or too tall, add <b>class="tooTall</b> or <b>class="tooWide</b> to the image tag like this:
<br><br>
‹img src="tooWideImageURL" class="tooWide"›
<br><br>
If you would like to add more art sections, simply add urls to the menu and use this code:
<br><br>
‹a name="title"›‹/a›<br>
‹div class="inside"›<br>
all your images here<br>
‹/div›
<br><br>
The <b>title</b> can be any word you want as long as it is not already used in the stylesheet or as a link to another section. If you're confused, take a look at the code and follow its example before mailing me. Make sure you don't just copy and paste that code as the ‹› are not actual angle brackets. You must use actual angle brackets.

Hellooo! This is a super basic template for a side-scrolling layout. If you want to have different spacing for each box, you can manually assign the margin-left/right to each box. If you'd like to change the default spacing, you can play around with the <i>margin-left</i> and <i>margin-right</i> under <b>.box</b> in the stylesheet.
<br><br>
You can move the credit to fit in with your design, but please don't delete it.

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
<br><br>
The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

		This layout is a bit more premade-ish compared to the other layouts, but I still encourage you to change colors, etc!
		<br><br>
		If you'd like to make more pages, then copy starting from ‹a name="page1"›‹/a›‹div class="inside" style="position: relative;"› all the way to ‹a href="#page2" style="position: absolute;" class="right"›‹/a›‹/div›. Of course, adjust the page turning links (‹a href="#page2" style="position: absolute;" class="right (or left)"›‹/a›) and the anchor (‹a name="page1"›‹/a›) accordingly.
		<br><br>
		Each page will hold 49 lines of text. Anything more will get cut off. 
		<br><br>
		The navigation to the right lets you jump to any page you want. So if your content is split into sections with multiple pages, then you can use the navigation in order to jump from section to section while using the left and right corners browse through pages within each section.

Copy and paste the first textarea's code into the lookup description place and then copy and paste the second textarea's code in between the style tags (they look like this: ‹style› ‹/style›).
<br><br><div class="tem">

<div class="inside">
<div>
Enter your content here. Most of the things that you might want to customize are at the top of the stylesheet, such as the background of the page and the color of the description box. To change the color that the description box turns into, go to "#desc:hover .inside" in the stylesheet and then change "background: #aab3fd;" to "background: #YourColorHere". You also have to change the background under "#desc:hover" to the same color. To change the initial color of the box, go to ".inside" and change the background color there. Also change the background of "#desc" to the same color.
<br><br>
If you want to change the font color of this description box, add "color: #YourColorHere" under ".inside".
<br><br>
If you put one of Neopets' images here (whose url goes like: //images.neopets.com/) and decide to resize it with html, you'll need create an id and assign the image the id. The width and height within the id need to be followed by !important. The css (the stuff you put within the stylesheet) will look like this:
<br><br><center>
#resizedImage { width: yourWidth!important; height: yourHeight!important; }
</center>
<br><br>
Your image in the html will then look like this: 
<br><br><center>
˂img src="imgURL" id="resizedImage"˃
</center>
<br><br>
You only need to do this if you are adding one of Neopets' images.

Enter your content here. Most of the things that you might want to customize are at the top half of the stylesheet.
<br><br>
To ensure that the page slides the correct distance, you will <b>have</b> to change it yourself (but don't worry, it's quite easy c:). You will need to change the <b>margin-top</b> under the very first item of the stylesheet. If the page needs to slide down more, <b>decrease</b> the number (ie -1385px to -1400px). If the page needs to slide up more, <b>increase</b> the number (ie -1385px to -1300px).
<br><br>
If you put one of Neopets' images here (whose url goes like: //images.neopets.com/) and decide to resize it with html, you'll need create an id and assign the image the id. The width and height within the id need to be followed by !important. The css (the stuff you put within the stylesheet) will look like this:
<br><br><center>
#resizedImage { width: yourWidth!important; height: yourHeight!important; }
</center>
<br><br>
Your image in the html will then look like this: 
<br><br><center>
˂img src="imgURL" id="resizedImage"˃
</center>
<br><br>
You only need to do this if you are adding one of Neopets' images. 
<br><br>
Remember to not to delete the credit!

Requests are <b>OPEN</b>
</center>
<br>
When you can't find that perfect premade/template that fits your idea or just can't edit a layout to your liking, I think it's time for you to request one! But before you run off and mail me, there's a few things you should be aware of...
<br><br><div style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
<li><i>**You must have a specific idea in mind. I won't do a "faerie themed" petpage but I will do a layout with three faeries surrounding a single, anchored textbox.**</i></li>
<li>I will not do graphics but I may do drawings. What's the difference? For me, graphics are pictures that are put together using filters/various pictures from around the site/poogle. An example is a banner. Generally you see them being for lookups. A drawing is something like the book above in the fourth petpage template. That being said, you can have someone else/you make the graphics. I won't mind using them.</li>
<li>If you have a premade and just need help editing it, those requests will <i>always be open</i>. You must have everything picked out (ie colors, graphics/pictures, fonts, etc) and already have a layout though. </li>
<li>If I haven't sent you a version within 5 days from when I accepted your request, <b>PLEASE MAIL ME.</b> I'm probably being lazy and not doing it.</li>
<li>This isn't really a guideline, but after I send you the first version, please don't be scared to tell me what you want changed! I'd be more than happy to completely redo it. Just please be polite about it =)</li>
<li>I reserve the right to reject any request I don't want to do.</li>
</div>
<br>
Please send the following form to my <a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=kloofe">main</a>. If you just need help editing a layout, just send me a link to the page and what colors, font, etc you want.
<br><br><center>
<textarea>
Type: (pet lookup, user lookup, petpage)
What you want it to look like: (Be detailed! I'll ask questions if I'm interested and need more details.)
Preferred Browser: (I try to make it work in most browsers but this one will be my priority)
Resolution: (It's ok if you don't know)

If user lookup: (What sections do you /not/ want included. ie neohome)
If pet lookup: (Which do you plan on getting- trophies, petpet, petpetpet)
