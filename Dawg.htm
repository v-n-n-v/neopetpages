How to play:

</textarea><br><br> --Make sure the Title is gaudy and obnoxious and you include the words "PET ROULETTE" in them so people can see it!<br><br>-- Do not host the board unless you have time to track the pot for everyone and keep track of who's gotten a bid and who must accept the next offer like this:<br><br><b>
 THE POT:</b> <br><br>
Pet1 - Mara Lenny (x)<br>
Pet2 - B Lupe<br>
Anotherpet - Pink Kacheek (UC)
<br><br> MUST TRADE:<br>Pet4 - Brown Moehog **<br><br><b>* = # of bids<br>
B = Basic pet<br>
UC = Unclothed<br>
(x) = Cant Initiate trade<br></b>

<br><br>
-- Try to post the pot on every page of the board or when new pets are added if you're able to keep up :)<br><br><font size="5"><b>If you have a NEOBOARD PEN, you can use this font for hosting:</b></font><br><textarea>[br][center][font s=6][b]*clap* THE POT: *clap*[/font][/b][p][p][p][/font][center]neoHTML[p][</textarea><br><textarea>][br][b]* = # of bids [br]B = Basic pet[br]UC = Unclothed[br](X) = Cant Initiate trade[/b][/center]</textarea><br><br>That is it!
