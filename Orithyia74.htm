    <h1>A Word From Orithyia</h1>
    <div class="content">
<img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/b5lltdcv/1/6.png" class="left"><p>"Oh, hi there. Come on in! My name is <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Orithyia74">Orithyia74</a>, but that's a lot to say, so you can just call me Ori. I was named after the Greek goddess of of cold, gusty mountain winds. I do like to play in the mountain snow, but only for a little while! I'm a Brown Zafara, and I'm almost 11 years old. I'm the youngest member of the family, and Mom says I'm a "handful". I like exploring, crafting, ice cream, and especially building things. I even built my petpet, Hors D'oeuvres. My sister Cally calls him that, because the Turmaculus is supposed to eat him, but I don't like that name. Soon, I'll make a new petpet, and give it a real name!</p>

<p>"I hope you enjoy the site and reading all about me. I think I'm pretty interesting, and I bet you will too!"</p>
    </div>

  <div class="subsection">
    <h1>Orithyia's Invention</h1>
    <div class="content">
<p>Orithyia dug around in her toolbox haphazardly, looking for her official Bigsby Shadington wrench. Stopping to think about where it could be, she looked up and spotted it on the other side of her room. Quickly, she squeezed under one large pipe and scrambled over another one. She went a bit too far, though, and slid all the way off it, landing on her head.</p>

<p>"Oof, that hurt," the brown Zafara said as she rubbed her head absently and reached for the wrench. Ori adjusted her purple overalls and went back to tinkering with the sprawling device taking up most of the floor in her room. The young inventor smiled to herself as she worked. This was going to be it, the creation that would prove her worth. She just had to figure out what it did...</p>

  <h1>Bonus Tale: Helpful Zafara</h1>
  <div class="content">

<p>"Come on, Mom!" Orithyia called over her shoulder as she trotted down the streets of Faerie City, "We're going to be late!"</p>
	
<p>"I'm coming, I'm coming," Artemis laughed, jogging a little breathlessly behind the exuberant Zafara.</p>
	
<p>Ori was so intent on her destination that she tripped over a crooked paving stone, nearly losing her balance and almost spilling her armload of deli turkey slices. Recovering, she headed directly for one large, pink building. She had to pause at the door so her mom could catch up and open it for her, then she zoomed inside.</p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/altador/altadorcup/2017/nc/fighters_club.jpg" class="wide" alt="The streets of Faerie City"><p>"Here you go! Everything you asked for!" she said, plopping down the food, and a job slip.</p>
	
<p>Orithyia loved visiting the Fairyland Employment Agency, and not for the neopoints, either. It made her feel grown-up and important, doing jobs for them, and she enjoyed helping people out. Of course, a little pocket change didn't hurt, either. Usukis weren't cheap.</p>
	
<p>"Congratulations," said the Faerie behind the desk, "You now hold the rank of Apprentice!</p>
	
<p>Orithyia's eyes widened with excitement, "Can I do another? Can I, Mom? Please, please!"</p>

<p>The Faerie secretary shook her head, "I'm sorry, but you've completed your quota of jobs for today. You'll have to try again tomorrow."</p>
	
<p>"Mom?"</p>
	
<p>Artemis smiled at her youngest, "Of course you can, dear. It's so good that you like to help out."</p>
	
<p>The Zafara puffed up with pride at that, "And I'm an Apprentice now! I can't wait until my next rank!!"</p>
	
<p>"There's some Juppieade in the fridge," Artemis noted, "Let's go home and have a snack to celebrate."</p>
	
<p>The two walked out of the Employment Agency and headed back to the house.</p>

    <div class="subsection">
  <h1>1. The Inventor At Home</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/2lwvmr9n/1/5.png" class="left" height="240" width="240"><p>Orithyia dug around in her toolbox haphazardly, looking for her official Bigsby Shadington wrench. Stopping to think about where it could be, she looked up and spotted it on the other side of her room. Quickly, she squeezed under one large pipe and scrambled over another one. She went a bit too far, though, and slid all the way off it, landing on her head.</p>

<p>"Oof, that hurt," the brown Zafara said as she rubbed her head absently and reached for the wrench. Ori adjusted her purple overalls and went back to tinkering with the sprawling device taking up most of the floor in her room. The young inventor smiled to herself as she worked. This was going to be it, the creation that would prove her worth. She just had to figure out what it did...</p>

<p>"Are you making another mess in here?" a haughty voice inquired from the direction of the door. It was Ori's older sister, Callythia. The striped Xweetok was dressed in a very fancy outfit, and was wearing a good deal of makeup. She tapped her foot, waiting for Orithyia's response. Cally, in Ori's mind at least, seemed to enjoy getting the young Zafara into trouble.</p>

<p>"I'm not making a mess, I'm inventing something," Orithyia shot back.</p>
	
<p>"I'm telling mom, she doesn't like it when you blow stuff up!" Cally announced triumphantly.</p>
	
<p>"Mom's not home, Aspalis is in charge," Ori said with a smirk, popping up from behind the bulk of her machine. Their oldest sister was much more lenient with Orithyia, especially when she was in charge.</p>

<p>"Hmpf." Callythia tossed her immaculately groomed hair over her shoulder and left, leaving the Zafara's bedroom door open.</p>

<p>"And close the door!" Ori yelled after her, even knowing it was no use. She went back to plugging wires and circuits into the center of her invention. Suddenly something sparked.</p>

<p>"Uh oh," she muttered, before being flung through the open door and into the hallway wall, as the patchwork device exploded in blue smoke.</p>

<p>Once she could stand, she hurried through the acrid smell to open her windows. Maybe if she could air things out in time, no one would notice. She turned around to see Aspalis, her oldest sister, leaning in the doorway, surveying the mess. The white Peophin's pale skin provided stark contrast to the heavy, dark makeup and goth clothing that she always preferred.</p>

<p>"At least no fire this time," Aspalis noted, before shrugging, "Okay, you go get a bucket of soap and water, and a sponge, and start working on those scorch marks. I'll open the rest of the windows in the house, then I'll help you pick up. But you're explaining to Mom what happened to your bedspread." The colorful comforter was shredded and blackened beyond repair.</p>

<p>Ori paused a moment, "How come you never yell at me when this happens?"</p>

<p>Aspalis chuckled, "Is there anything in Neopia that would stop you from trying to 'invent' things?"</p>

<p>"Well...no."</p>

<p>"Then why waste my breath? Hurry up now, it'll be easier on you if most of the mess is dealt with before Mom gets home." Aspalis turned to leave, then stopped, "Oh, there's someone I want you to meet with me, tomorrow in the park."</p>

<p>"Who?" Ori asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>"You'll see," Aspalis answered with a sly smile.</p>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
  <h1>2. At the Park</h1>
  <div class="content">
<p>Orithyia skipped down the park path towards a bend, ahead of Aspalis. It was a beautiful spring day, and she was not about to wait around for her pokey older sister to catch up. She rounded the bend, and stopped in her tracks. Frozen, she didn't know what to do or say.</p>

<p>"Oh good, both of you could make it!" Aspalis said, greeting the two individuals in front of them. The Peophin continued, "This is my baby sister, Orithyia, who I told you about."</p>

<p>Ori could do nothing but stare, wide-eyed, while swallowing hard. There in front of her was none other than the Crafting Faerie, Delina, and even more astonishingly, Dr. Landelbrot, who never left his ship, the Coincidence, these days. Slowly it sunk in that Aspalis had somehow found both of them, and convinced them to meet with Ori. <i>Two of her biggest heroes! What was she to do?</i></p>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/rQ7642r.png" class="right"><p>Delina chuckled at the gobsmacked Zafara, "Hey there, little one. I hear you're quite the creator, yourself. What have you been working on, lately?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Dr. Landelbrot chimed in, "Your sister tells me you are quite the scientist and inventor! She thought maybe we could collaborate on a project."</p>

<p><i>Her? A scientist? Collaborate with them on something?</i> Ori's mind whirled in confusion, until she felt Aspalis nudging her forward with one hoof.</p>

<p>"I, well, I...my last project kind of exploded," Ori shamefacedly admitted, "Actually, they all tend to do that."</p>

<p>"Failure is often the best way to improve," Dr. Landelbrot proclaimed, "If we learn from our mistakes, we have a much better chance at success!"</p>

<p>"He's right, I sometimes think two things will go together wonderfully, but they just don't work out," Delina added, "Then I have to figure out why, exactly, they didn't work." The dark faerie led the way over to a nearby picnic table covered in papers, some blank, some with sketches and notes on them.</p>

<p>Ori thought about that for a moment, "I don't know why my machine didn't work, I didn't even know what it did yet. I was still putting it together."</p>

<p>"How can you make something if you don't know what you're making?" Delina asked, shaking her head in confusion.</p>

<p>"Sounds like you have things a little backwards, young one. First you have to decide on your goal, then plan out how to reach it," Dr. Landelbrot nodded sagely.</p>

<p><i>A plan? That sounded boring,</i> Ori thought. "But I just like building things."</p>

<p>Dr. Landelbrot chuckled, "Me too, me too. Still, first you have to have an idea of what to build. The rest will follow. I know, let's hatch out a plan together. We just need an idea...What's something you need, or want, around the house?"</p>

<p>Orithyia gave some deep thought to that. What would be useful around the house? As a spark of an idea caught, her eyes lit up, and she began explaining to the two others, grabbing a blank piece of paper to sketch on. She never even noticed that Aspalis had left the three of them alone a long time ago.</p>

  </div>
  </div>

 <div class="subsection">
  <h1>3. The Mysterious Whatsit</h1>
  <div class="content">
 
<p>"IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII...LOVE YOU!" Ori shouted as she burst through Aspalis' bedroom door and landed on her sister with a thump, bear hugging the poor Peophin like mad.</p>
	
<p>"Ooof...Need to breathe," Aspalis gasped. Orithyia let go and her sister continued, "I take it you had a good time?"</p>
	
<p>The little Zafara took a deep breath and began to gush without stopping, "I had the best time! Delina was so nice and had so many ideas for, well, it's a secret, but she made it really pretty, and she can draw so nice, she did all that part, and Dr. Landelbrot had all sorts of good advice and tips, and he's so good at problem solving, and we made a plan for a thing that is super top-secret, and can you help me hang up some sheets in the backyard so I can work without anyone seeing?" Ori paused for air and looked at her big sister expectantly.</p>

<p>"The backyard?" Aspalis asked, "No, nevermind, it's super top-secret, I won't ask. Yes, I can give you a hand."</p>
	
<p>"Aspalis? Why did you do all this for me?" Orithyia asked, a confused frown on her face.</p>
	
<p>"Because you're my sister, dopey. And because you were going to burn the house down, otherwise," the Peophin ruffled the fur on top of Ori's head playfully, "Let's get those sheets up."</p>

<hr><p>The next few days saw a flurry of mysterious activity behind the curtained-off area. Ori could be seen happily trotting between her room and the work area, carrying boxes with everything from wires, to gears, to what looked like her entire Usuki collection. She even dragged the garden hose across the lawn. Dr. Landelbrot came by with more components at one point, and Delina arrived one day with her paints and stayed behind the curtains for a few hours.</p>
	
<p>"What on Neopia is she doing back there?" their brother, Galanthis, wondered.</p>
	
<p>Aspalis just shrugged, as mystified as anyone.</p>
	
<p>The Lutari matched her shrug with his own, "Well, at least it hasn't blown up, yet".</p>
	
<p>"And she's happy, whatever she's making," the Peophin added.</p>
	
<p>Callythia popped her head out of her room and hollered, "Has anybody seen my favorite hairbrush? It's missing, and I need it now!"</p>

<p>Galanthis considered this for a moment, "Pink with purple stars?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the Xweetok huffed, exasperated.</p>
	
<p>Her brother paused for a moment. "Nope, haven't seen it."</p>
	
<p>"Arrgh, I'm going to be late!" Cally griped, before returning to her search.</p>
	
<p>Aspalis looked at her brother appraisingly.</p>
	
<p>"Orithyia?" she asked quietly.</p>
	
<p>"Not saying a word."</p>

 </div></div>

 <div class="subsection">
  <h1>4. The Unveiling</h1>
  <div class="content">
	
<p>Two weeks later, Orithyia knocked timidly on Galanthis' door.</p>
	
<p>"What's up, baby sis?" he wondered, letting her in.</p>
	
<p>"It's ready, my machine," she began, tense with excitement and nerves, "But, uh, I was hoping you might be willing to help me run the final test. You and Zarex. I'd use my Teek, but, well, you'll see. It's safe, though, I tested it <i>thoroughly</i>." She nodded emphatically at that point.</p>
	
<p>Galanthis was more than a little nervous about putting his beloved Sandan in any one of Ori's contraptions, "Why not use Aspalis' petpet? This was her idea, after all."</p>
	
<p>"You're the only one home." the Zafara admitted, "Plus, I want it to be ready for when Callythia gets back."</p>
	
<p>"Callythia??" Galanthis asked with astonishment. The two sisters didn't often get along. Overcome with curiosity, the Lutari relented, "Okay, we'll test it, but if you hurt Zarex..."</p>
	
<p>"He's safe, I <i>tested</i> it, just like Dr. Landelbrot taught me to."</p>
	
<p>The two siblings headed outside with Galanthis' Sandan, Zarex, who seemed supremely unconcerned by the whole arrangement.</p>
	
<p>Behind the curtain of sheets was a conveyor belt of mismatched parts running through what looked like several large, beautifully painted cardboard boxes. The first one was attached to the garden hose, Galanthis noted. Then he saw the pile of Usuki dolls in the corner, some with wild hair, some with makeup caked on their faces, and one that looked liked it had been scalped. He immediately reverted to thinking this was a very bad idea, and went to snatch up Zarex.</p>
	
<p>Orithyia had already started the conveyor belt, and his petpet had spotted the treat hanging in front of the first box. Quick as anything, the Sandan hopped up on the conveyor and snagged his prize, sitting down on the moving belt and munching contentedly as he entered the first box.</p>
	
<p>There was the sound of the hose sprayer turning on, followed by an indignant squeal. Before Galanthis could do anything, his petpet reappeared, soaking wet and grumpy. Zarex entered the second box, and they could hear a hair dryer activating. Slowly, Galanthis began to understand. The petpet emerged, now dry, but with his fur sticking out every-which-way. The final box was the longest one. Ori and her brother hurried to the end to see the results.</p>
	
<p>Zarex emerged, his arms crossed and a look of disgruntlement on his face. His fur was immaculately brushed and groomed, there was nail polish on his tiny claws, a hint of perfume in the air, and a little blue bow tying the fur on the top of his head into a pigtail.</p>
	
<p>"It works!" Ori jumped around with excitement, "My automatic petpet groomer works! Now it just needs a name..."</p>
	
<p>Galanthis, relieved to get his petpet back in one piece, actually gave it some thought. "The Petpet Grooming Express. No...the Salon-o-matic, um...."</p>
	
<p>Orithyia snapped her fingers, "I've got it! The Palace of Pampering! She'll like that."</p>
	
<p>Galanthis shook his head in disbelief, "You made this for Callythia?"</p>
	
<p>"Well, for all of you guys, but mostly her. She grooms her Seece as much as she does her own fur." Orithyia shrugged, "I thought it would save her some time."</p>

<p>The Palace of Pampering was a huge hit. Even Cally had to agree that it did a great job, and her Seece liked it so much they had to keep it from going through over and over again. Orithyia went on to create many interesting machines for the house, some more useful than others. She stayed close friends with Delina, and often helped out in the Dark Faerie's workshop, and she exchanged neomails with Dr. Landelbrot regularly. She was becoming the inventor she always wanted to be, without ever blowing the house up.</p>
	
<p>Callythia never found her hairbrush.</p>

<div class="page" id="two">
  <div class="title">
    <span>Section title here</span>
  </div>
  
  <div class="subsection">
  <h1>A subsection heading</h1>
  <div class="content">
    These are your <b>content areas!</b> You can have as many or as few of these under each section as you like. If you prefer, you can just have one content area per section and split it up with headings instead.<br><br><h1>A heading inside a content area looks like this</h1>
    The whole page will scroll if you put in enough content areas, but the navigation will always be fixed at the top to move between the sections of your site. <i>Nifty.</i><br><br></div></div>
  
  <div class="subsection">
  <h1>Different methods of displaying images</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <img src="//pets.neopets.com/cpn/aethelar/1/4.png" class="side">
    You can use the <b>side class</b> to set up an image to the left. If you want to include a textarea in this side bit, adjust the width with <i>inline styles</i> to make sure the textarea fits next to the image and doesn't wrap below.<br><textarea class="fancy" style="width: 400px;">This is a textarea - fancy style!<br><br><b>NB</b> - I had to take the textarea tags out to upload this page to Beetle; just replace <i>(textarea)</i> and <i>(/textarea)</i> with angled brackets in the code.
    </textarea><br>
    If you don't like the <i>fancy style</i> textarea, you can also have a plain one - just leave out the <b>class="fancy</b> part.<br><textarea style="width: 400px; height: 70px;">Like this! Lovely and simple. You can also adjust the size with inline styles, like I have for this textarea to make it taller.</textarea><br>
    Or the alternative is to use a wide image as below - apply the class <b>wide</b> to your image:<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/faerieland/quests/faeries/grey-faerie-2-2.jpg" class="wide"><textarea class="fancy">And use a textarea without any inline styles applied to make it full width!</textarea></div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="subsection">
    <h1>Using tables</h1>
    <div class="content">
      You can use tables as you normally would inside these content areas. The only thing I have done is added a <i>two-column</i> style like the table below which will give you two equal width columns that take up the full width of the content area. If you want a different sized table, then just leave off the <i>two-column</i> class and build your table like you normally would!<br><table class="two-column"><tr><td><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cpn/aethelar/1/4.png"></td>
          <td>Text goes here! The default style is that text is <b>vertically and horizontally centered</b> so that it appears in the middle of the cell. You can change this by adding <i>text-align: left;</i> or <i>vertical-align: top;</i> to the CSS for <b>.two-column td { }</b></td>
        </tr><tr><td>
            A textarea inside a <i>two-column</i> table cell will automatically resize to fit the table cell.<br><textarea class="fancy">Like this!</textarea></td>
          <td><img src="//images.neopets.com/shh/event/grey-faerie-1.png"></td>
        </tr></table></div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="subsection">
    <h1>To add more sections</h1>
    <div class="content">
      Under the navigation, add a new link by using the following: <b>Â«a href="#five"Â»FiveÂ«/aÂ»</b><br><br>
      Then copy and paste the code below to create a new blank section. Make sure you paste it outside the other <i>page</i> divs - the order doesn't matter, so it's easiest to just paste this right at the end of your HTML:<br><br><textarea style="height: 240px;"><div class="page" id="five">
  <div class="title">
    <span>Section title here</span>
  </div>
  
  <div class="subsection">
  <h1>A subsection heading</h1>
  <div class="content">
    
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="spacer"></div>
</div></textarea></div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="subsection">
    <h1>Adding navigation within a section</h1>
    <div class="content">
      If you want to add links to the different subsections within a section then:<br><br><b>1.</b> Add an ID to your subsection: <i>Â«div class="subsection" id="nameofsubsection"Â»</i><br><b>2.</b> Create a link to that ID: <i>Â«a href="#nameofsubsection"Â» Link text here Â«/aÂ»</i><br><b>3.</b> <b>Very important: </b> Don't remove the <i>spacer div</i> at the end of your subsection: <i>Â«div class="spacer"Â» Â«/divÂ»</i><br><br><a href="/">Your link is formatted like this.</a><br><br>
      Why do we add the spacer div? To stop the subsection navigation from breaking the page. When you link to a part of the page like this the browser will put it <b>at the top of the screen</b> - even it is has to move your <i>page</i> div around to get it there. And because our page divs aren't designed to move like that, the link can break the layout. The <i>spacer</i> div ensures that the browser can always move something to the top of the page without breaking the layout in any way.
