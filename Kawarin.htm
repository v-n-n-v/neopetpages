	<h3><a href="/~Ulysi">Skyfall's</a> Review</h3>
		<center><a href="/~Ulysi"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/89eClR9.gif" border="0"></a><br><em><strong>Rubric:</strong> In-depth Review | <strong>Date:</strong> October 4, 2022 | <strong>Deem:</strong> Recommended<br></em><img src="http://i.imgur.com/j4U7zcV.png"></center>
		<p><b>First Impression</b></p>
		<p class="indent">Emily, the owner of <a href="/~Ulysi">Skyfall</a>, established a beautifully crafted graphic request site in July 2020. Though the site has not been updated recently, the graphic resources and information are <strong>valuable</strong> to new users who want to know about the basics of using images on pet pages. Additionally, the minimal color scheme in the layout increases its <i>welcoming nature</i> and <i>beginner-friendly</i> attitude. I enjoy the small quantity but high-quality resources. In Emily's request, their concern for Skyfall is visitor convenience while navigating and concise areas in the site's content. With this in mind, let's get to the meat of this review.</p>
		<p><b>Introduction | 5/5</b></p>
		<p class="indent">The introduction is <strong>wonderfully crafted</strong>. Four key elements are needed when a visitor clicks on your site: the page name, who owns the site, what the site offers, and a link to your user lookup. The introduction included <i>all</i> the key elements. Great job!</p>
		<p class="indent">Though the page has not been updated recently, updates were <strong>frequent and informative</strong>. I <b>recommend</b> putting somewhere on the updates section or the home page that Skyfall is on hiatus. Adding a hiatus sign or hiatus status to the site will notify users that you're still <strong>active on Neopets</strong> but working on other projects. Keep page visitors in the loop by giving them a notice instead of not updating the site.</p>
		<p class="indent">This next suggestion attributes to <i>organization</i>, but I feel this is important to the updates section and visitors' first impressions of the introduction. The data block in your updates floats to the right. If the block's content is <b>not big enough</b> to span the entire height of the date's color block and update again, the blocks will float against each other; this <i>appears disorganized</i>. This is a <strong>subtle issue</strong> that is easily fixed by using the coding in the textarea below. A screenshot of the datablocks in question is below as well - drag and drop or open image in a new tab to see the full sized image.</p>
		<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/o0YHWuB.png" style="height: 50px;"><textarea style="height: 50px;" class="example"><div style="clear: both; width: 99%; background: none; border: 0; padding: 1px 0 0 0; visibility: hidden;"></div></textarea></center>
		<p class="indent">Not updating and this misalignment can <b>skew a visitor's impression</b> and they'll unlikely revisit. A visitor's first three to five seconds on a page is <i>vital</i>. Within that short time, users will decide to go to a <strong>different</strong> site or <strong>continue</strong> to another more updated graphics page.</p>
		<p class="indent">On a lighter note, the space created by the sub-navigation is <b>very creative</b>. The area is thoughtfully crafted by putting the request status and page-related links, but make sure to add some note or astrick for external links, so users don't unknowingly leave.</p>
		<p class="indent">At the end of the introduction, you state, <em>If you can't find what you're looking for, why not go ahead and request a custom graphic?</em> There is nothing inherently wrong with this statement. Actually, it is grammatically correct and functional, but I would suggest <strong>rewording</strong> it. Marketing tactics are just as important here on Neopets, and in real life. With that being said, seldom would a company explain to their prospective customer base to use their product if they can't find something. We want to <strong>encourage them</strong> to think of our services first. Not when they aren't able to find something (disclaimer: keep in mind this business model isn't invalid because it can apply to link directories. I wanted to add that here, but we are talking about Skyfall, a graphic site). So if we reword this sentence to still convey that same meaning, it will motivate visitors to request a graphic. Reword to something along the lines of: Are you looking for something specific? Go ahead and request a custom graphic.</p>
		<p><b>Spelling and Grammar | 4/5</b></p>
		<p class="indent">In this section, changes will be <b>bolded</b> and original statements are <i>italisized</i> in blockquotes. If an explanation is warranted, it will be located below the blockquote.</p>
		<blockquote id="s">On your homepage: <br><i>Skyfall opened 30th of July, 2020 and offers premade graphics such as icons and shields.</i><br>Skyfall opened 30th of July, 2020<b>,</b> and offers premade graphics such as icons and shields.</blockquote>
		<p>This sentence is tricky because the beginning statement is an independent clause. The next one is a dependent clause, meaning there is no subject in the sentence. Together, this is called a complex sentence. In order for this to be grammatically correct, all we need to do is add a comma before the conjunction. In this case, it's <b>and</b>.</p>
		<blockquote id="s">In terms of use:<br><i>Change anything you want, but keep the credits <b>on</b>.</i><br>Change anything you want but keep the credits.</blockquote>
		<p>Here are two independent clauses with the correct usage of a comma,. Great job! But, let's make it slightly more concise. If we remove the word "on" in the sentence, the meaning is still there. By doing this, we reduce redundancy because the phrase "keep the credits" implies the credits are <strong>on the graphics</strong>. I recommend reading through your sentences to search for these small changes that can be removed without changing the meaning. Doing so will provide clarity in your writing and instructions.</p>
		<blockquote id="s"><i>Use <b>copy</b> the code provided above...</i><br>Use the code provided above...</blockquote>
		<p>Remove the misplace word "copy" for clarity.</p>
		<blockquote id="s">In requests - buttons - terms and conditions:<br><i>(i.e. colour schemes, image placement, etc)</i><br>(i.e<b>,</b> colour schemes, image placement, etc<b>.</b>)</blockquote>
		<p>Be sure to use the correct punctuation for ed est and et cetera.</p>
		<blockquote id="s">In request a button:<br><i>... or would rather leave it up <b>too</b> me.</i><br>... or would rather leave it up to me.</blockquote>
		<p>The word <strong>too</strong> is only applicable if the sentence when an adverb is needed because it means also. In this case we need the preposition <strong>to</strong>.</p>
		<blockquote id="s">In pickup:<br><i>Please note<b>: -You are advised</b> to save the image...</i><br>Please note: I advise you to save the image...</blockquote>
		<p>Condensed the sentence slightly and also chose only one punctuation for the please note.</p>
		<blockquote id="s">In resources - button bases:<br><i><b>d</b>o whatever you like with these!</i><br>Do whatever you like with these!</blockquote>
		<p>Be sure to capitalize the first letter in sentences.</p>
		<blockquote id="s">In tips:<br><i>... issue arises on the <b>siteowner's</b> side.</i><br>... issues arises on the site owner's side.</blockquote>
		<p>Site owner is two words, so we only need to add a space there.</p>
		<blockquote id="s"><i>Usually, when using icons, you don't want <b>it</b> to be in a line by <b>its</b> own... This probably not what you had in mind.</i><br>Usually, when using icons, you don't want them to be in a line all on their own... This is probably not what you had in mind.</blockquote>
		<p>Here is an example where the subject, in this case icons, is plural. The subsequent subjects in the sentence don't agree with the plural form because you use the singular form. Once changed to the plural, the sentence flows nicer and easier to understand. I also added the word "is" before probably because it was missing.</p>
		<blockquote id="s"><i>... the image will float<b>,</b> to the right.</i><br>... the image will float to the right.</blockquote>
		<p>No need for the comma after float.</p>
		<blockquote id="s"><i>One last<b>,</b> important thing to take note of...</i><br>One last important thing to take note of...</blockquote>
		<p>Misplaced comma. No biggie.</p>
		<blockquote id="s">In awards and achievements:<br><i>... event over at Unwound Clock.Skyfall...</i><br>... event over at Unwound Clock. Skyfall...</blockquote>
		<p>I added a space after the punctuation in the sentence.</p>
		<blockquote id="s">Affiliates:<br><i><b>m</b>ail me if interested!</i><br>Mail me if interested!</blockquote>
		<p>Don't forget to capitalized the first letter of sentences.</p>
		<p class="indent">Yay! You made it to the end of the grammar and spelling portion of the review! This is one of the more tedious to read, so I applaud you for getting through that!</p>
		<p>-1 various small grammatical errors</p>
		<p><b>Organization | 9/10</b></p>
		<p class="indent">The requester's concerns regarding concise content and navigating topics are discussed here, so let's do this! Icons, shields, buttons, and resources are all <strong>organized, spaced, and centered evenly</strong>. For graphic sites, it is <i>essential</i> to maintain this organization and not appear cluttered. Bonus brownie points for having a site map because this little addition to the site is nostalgic to 2012 Neopets and is very convenient! Excellent job keeping a <b>great structure</b> on the page. There are a few recommendations to improve and condense some areas, though.</p>
		<p class="indent">In resources, there are a lot of links to navigate through. I highly recommend combining neomail, back/next, and open/closed into one link called "signs." This will <strong>reduce the navigating experience</strong> in resources, but if this idea is not appealing, another suggestion is using a sub-sub-navigation, similar to the icon's sub-sub-navigation. Also, the extra tips section can use sub-sub-navigation assistance, so users don't have to <b>scroll</b> to locate the tip they are looking for.</p>
		<p class="indent">In the rules and conditions for button and shield requests, I <strong>recommend centering</strong> <i>I have read the rules!</i> so it is a more intuitive requesting experience. When text is aligned to the right instead of the left or center, it can take a few seconds to realize where it is because our brains are trained to read left to right. This does not solely apply to the rules section. This applies to all pages with links to their respective page.</p>
		<p class="indent">In the sitely section, the link back buttons are <strong>slightly off-aligned</strong> to the left because they aren't centered. I suggest centering them and their textareas to match the structure you have set up for the section.</p>
		<p>-1 minor navigating and centering concerns</p>
		<p><b>Site and Layout | 9/10</b></p>
		<p class="indent">The layout is <strong>splendid</strong>. From the color scheme to the overall minimalism, it's wonderfully coded, clean, and crisp. The small touches of border-radius on the corners of the layout can sometimes seem too much if the radius is significant, but it's slight and adds a creative touch to a simple squared design. Also, even though in your review request there was concern for navigating the site, I did not have <b>any trouble</b> navigating the main components of Skyfall. The sub-navigation <strong>aid's the user's experience</strong> traveling through the page. Great job!</p>
		<p class="indent">However, I have two <strong>considerable recommendations</strong> for the button and shield request pages. Navigating these pages is easy, but getting back to them <i>after</i> clicking on each request's <strong>guides</strong> on picking images and animations is pretty inconvenient.</p>
		<p class="indent">For the button request's guide, if a requester clicks the <i>Back to the form!</i> button, they will return to the rules <strong>instead of the form</strong>. This, in a combination of the <i>I have read the rules!</i> button aligned to the right, creates a monotonous requesting experience while trying to go back and forth between pages.</p>
		<p class="indent">As for the shield's guide, it's a <strong>similar situation</strong>, but the shield's guide has no button to return to the requesting page. So the requester must <b>use the sub-navigation</b> to return to the rules page and again press the right aligned, <i>I have read the rules!</i> button to request a shield. I <b>highly recommend</b> adding back buttons to both guides so they return to the <strong>requesting page</strong> and not the rules. This will improve requester's convenience drastically. Lastly, there's some side-scrolling on the shield's guide. I couldn't locate what is causing this, so I suggest looking at the <i>(span class= "half")</i> because that could be why this is happening. If so, reducing the width to 49% on both spans will ensure there is 1% of free space, so there is no side-scrolling.</p>
		<p class="indent">I <b>highly recommend</b> clicking on every link on Skyfall and asking yourself, "Is this the intended page to go to when I click on this?" And "How can I improve guest experience on this specific page?" When doing this, usually, we can add a few essential key elements to a page: back buttons to the previous intended page, reduce any side-scrolling, and formatting content in different ways, etc.</p>
		<p class="indent">Even though this was a minor error, requesting is a big part of Skyfall's content, so this is important to fix and will hurt the score of this section.</p>
		<p>-1 visitor inconvenience.</p>
		<p><b>Aesthetics | 4/5</b></p>
		<p class="indent">The teal, yellow, and grey go very well together, and those colors are implemented very well into the layout. The slight teal-colored hover on the main navigation is beautiful. Also, the well-integrated icons floated to the left all over the site fit great because it emphasizes that Skyfall offers graphics. I must warn you to be careful with the yellow and orange colors against a lighter background, like white. Right now, it is slightly hard to read the <strong>strong attribute</strong> on your page. The purpose of using <strong>strong</strong>, <b>bold</b>, and <i>italic</i> styling in HTML is to <b>highlight and emphasize</b>, but the lighter color does the opposite. Instead of using <font style="color: #ffb593; background-color: #fbf8e1; font-weight: bold;">#FFB593</font>, use <font style="color: #ff9260; background-color: #fbf8e1; font-weight: bold;">#FF9260</font>. Look at that improvement! Even though it is not directly the exact color of your layout's color scheme, as long as it's a <b>similar</b> color, the human (and Neopian) brain won't be able to tell the difference because it's a monochromatic color! This will greatly improve readability and fix this issue.</p>
		<p class="indent">Furthermore, I <b>highly recommend</b> increasing the font size and color depth of your text areas, specifically in the <strong>request and suggestion</strong> pages. I like filling out the forms when requesting something, but at the moment, it is pretty <i>challenging</i> with the small text size and hard-to-read colors. Additionally, the hover mechanic added to the text area is an exciting concept that I enjoy, but ensuring visibility of the forms is the priority. Cam's site, <a href="/~roidir">Someday in Ecstasy</a>, offers an extras section where he styled many text areas. I suggest looking at them and editing the line height for you to use, or take inspiration. </p><center><a href="/~Roidir"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Z3OmWwu.gif" border="0"></a></center>
		<p>-1 visibility issues with hard-to-read colors.</p>
		<p><b>Content and Quality of Service | 9/10</b></p>
		<p class="indent">Skyfall's content is <strong>awe-inspiring</strong>. The quality of the icons is top-notch, and each image is cropped and edited nicely. Same for the shields and resources offered. There is a distinct quality that screams high quality.</p>
		<p class="indent">However, I recommend paying more attention to image placement and cropping. There are some improvements in one icon and a few of the buttons on the pickup section, so let's get into more detail about that.</p>
		<img src="http://i.imgur.com/2xOD2C4.png" class="icon" style="padding-left: 0px;"><p class="indent">This Meerca icon is wonderfully edited, but I wish the image were cropped less into the Meecra. If the image focused only on the Meerca or zoomed out slightly more to focus on the Meerca <b>and</b> the fish negg, the icon would not feel strangely placed. In the future, look at the image you plan to use for a graphic and determine what is/are the focal point(s) so the graphic won't cramp itself into small icons.</p>
		<p class="indent">Similarly, buttons are even more complicated with image cropping and placement because there is less space to work with. For example, the two buttons below:</p>
		<center><a href="/~ulysi"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/WwxEs4f.gif" border="0" class="button"></a><a href="/~ulysi"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/E9ACfyl.gif" border="0" class="button"></a></center><p class="indent">The Chibi Maker button is edited, animated, and text designed very well, but the image placement is cropping the bellflower on the left. If the image was <b>slightly more zoomed out</b> on the focal point, this button would have elevated from a B+ to an A+. For the second button, the Prismatic faerieland button is, like the other button, wonderfully designed, but the image placement is lacking. If the image was moved slightly to the left, the text would stand out because the space between the image's focal point and the text would be even. Right now, the text is on the cloud with the faerieland building. This is an <strong>easy fix</strong> though. When making buttons, I like to circle the main focus of the image I'm using. Then, I'll make sure my subject is entirely inside the button. I recommend you trying this out too! Make sure to remove the circle before publishing the button though, you'll only want to make that mistake once. <i>oops.</i></p>
		<p class="indent">As buttons, they serve as a business card in a way, so if text is legible and appealing, it is excellent for visitor and page owner relations. Pay more attention to detail in imagery and you'll be set! As it is, you have great strength in animating buttons and have a fantastic eye for picking the right fonts. Below are some of my favorite buttons in the pickup section:
		</p><center><a href="/~ulysi"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GrGxwft.gif" border="0"></a></center><p class="indent">This Hermes button is so unique and simple. The animation is very intuitive and something I have not seen before - this is a good thing! The simple border and italic Georgia font give it a <strong>cute and elegant</strong> feeling. It is one of the best buttons you have created.</p>
		<center><a href="/~ulysi"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vw7UFgJ.gif" border="0"></a></center><p class="indent">This Chibi Maker button is simple, but it gets the job done. The font is placed ideally next to the gif. Additionally, the pop of color on the text to tie in the image and the button together is genius!</p>
		<center><a href="/~ulysi"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3uWt8nS.gif" border="0"></a></center><p class="indent">Okay, there's a lot to say about this button. The image's cropping is an excellent example of great placement. Unlike your other buttons, there is barely a border here. Additionally, the editing is monochromatic, which can seem bland. Still, it does not feel that way because of the crispness of the image, placement of the text aside from the focal point, simple yet effective animation, and different borders. Great job doing something out of style for your buttons. <i>Absolutely stunning!</i> </p>
		<p class="indent">As for the service, it is excellent! On every page, Skyfall added instructions on how to use their graphics. The provided guides scattered on the site are also very <strong>insightful</strong> to new users who need assistance choosing images for request, learning about image hosting sites, or learning how to float images effectively.</p>
		<p class="indent">I highly suggest reading through your rules and guides out loud to locate where you could improve some sentences. For example, in the shield guide, you state, <i>I don't currently take shield requests for animated gif images, so please check the premades if you want one.</i> This can seem very dishonest to a requester because on first impression Skyfall offers requests, and the guide says Skyfall <b>does not</b> offer shield requests. I understand the message is Skyfall doesn't do request for gif images, but to a common requester, this can seem confusing. If more assistance is needed rewording the principles for requests on Skyfall, feel free to <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=persict&amp;subject=Assistance+with+Skyfall+principles">neomail me</a> so I can assist.</p>
		<p>-1 image placement and cropping issues.</p>
		<p><b>Link Audit | 5/5</b></p>
		<p class="indent">Under affiliates, <a href="/~Sonaeko">Fleur /~Sonaeko</a> has no more content on their page. I suggest removing them since they have closed. I would deduct half a point for not paying attention to the affiliates section. However, Skyfall has not been updated recently, so this <b>won't</b> affect your score.</p>
		<p>Additionally, I recommend adding neomail subjects to your neomail links. Doing this adds more user convenience and will remove one more step the visitor, or hopefully, the requester, has to complete when sending a neomail. Here is how you would format that:</p>
		<center><textarea style="height: 50px;" class="example"><a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=emilyhunter5034&amp;subject=This+Is+The+Subject+Line">neomail me</a></textarea></center>
		<center><b>Recommended</b> or Not Recommended </center>
		<p class="indent">Skyfall. Iconic (pun intended), high quality graphics, requests, and resources. There's not too much to say other than <i>wow</i>. I encourage everyone to keep a close watch on Emily because when they come back from a hiatus, Skyfall is the site to request a shield, button, or have a spiffy new icon to put on your page. I am very excited to see what and how Skyfall's future unveils. With a total score of <i>45/50</i>, I highly recommend Skyfall to anyone when it come back from hiatus.</p>

	<h3><a href="/~twinsmagic">Circle Star's</a> Review</h3>
		<center><a href="/~twinsmagic"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/C4uZXMM.gif" border="0"></a><br><em><strong>Rubric:</strong> Pro and Con Review | <strong>Date:</strong> September 26, 2022<br></em><img src="http://i.imgur.com/j4U7zcV.png"></center>
		<p class="indent">In Mei's request, they've detailed they want to offer more content. After examining other Neopets history sites, I suggest Circle Star could offer: What happened during the Neo-apocolapse? What were past versions of Neopets (i.e. UC pets, first versions of pets etc., other ownerships of neopets), Nostalgic memories from Neopets' past. I hope these suggestions help spark an idea.</p>
		<p><b>Site's Strengths</b></p>
		<ul><li>Your layout tells visitors what the page is about and is visually appealing. History pages seldom use custom layouts, which is refreshing to see at Circle Star.</li>
			<li>The information formatted on the page is <strong>easily accessible</strong>. Listing information in a list with headers for each sub-section makes a history page enjoyable and easy to read.</li>
			<li>The graphics provided are simple but neatly produced and <b>crisp</b>. There is a wide versatility of these pins that users can use for pets and userlookups.</li> 
			<li>The layout is easy to navigate, especially with the drop-down sub-navigation that appears for the years link.</li>
		</ul><p><b>Areas Needing Improvement</b></p>
		<ul><li>The size of pins are <strong>pretty large</strong>. I suggest resizing them to 75 by 75 pixels so two pins can fit in a row, and you'll reduce scrolling on the pin's page. Additionally, resizing the textareas to fit below the pins will further minimize scrolling. I suggest using a table for them like the template below. Remember to <i>add a note</i> at the beginning of the page that pins are resized, and dragging and dropping them into the address bar would display their full size.<center><textarea class="example"><table style="width: 99%;"><tr><td style="width: 49%;">
		This is where the pins would go. And you could also put the textarea here too. 
	</td>
	<td style="width: 49%;">
		This is where the pins would go. And you could also put the textarea here too. 
	</td>
	</tr></table></textarea></center></li>
		<li>Similarly, resizing all textareas to fit their corresponding graphic would benefit the organization of the page. For buttons, resize the width to 88 pixels.</li>
		<li>In your CSS, the bolded elements <strong>differ</strong> from the main body's font size. I suggest having unified font sizes on your page, so the line height of your text doesn't change.</li>
		<li>I suggest rewording the beginning paragraph on the left side of the layout to introduce the page differently. Instead of asking questions to the visitor, try rephrasing it to something like "Welcome to Circle Star, a Neopets History site that offers curated pins for you to display wherever your heart desires. My name is Mei, and I can't wait for you to look around and enjoy reading!" Doing this will give more information to the visitor about what the page is about and what you offer.</li>
		<li>Changing the beginning of the right page to year one instead of pins would improve the page's theme and put more emphasis on what the site offers. At the moment, it could be <b>misinterpreted</b> as a graphics site instead of a history page.</li>
		<li>Adding links at the bottom and top of the year's pages to navigate between years would further instill the layout's theme. For example, in year four, adding links to go back to year three and advance to year five would improve your site's already accessible navigation.</li>
		<li>I recommend adding the corresponding pin at the bottom of each year for even more visitor convenience. So, year one would have the year one pin at the bottom, year two would have the year two pin at the bottom, etc.</li>
		</ul><p class="indent">Thank you for requesting a review at Candor. Though it is not necessary, please link back to Candor and I look forward to hearing from you in the future! Thank you, and congratulations on your review!</p>

		<p><b>First Impression</b></p>
		<p class="indent"><a href="/">Thomas</a> recently revamped their button request site, Buttoneer. Personally, there are a lot of <strong>fond memories</strong> attached to Buttoneer from back in the day. Those memories translate into the now simplistic reopened site. Thomas gets extra brownie points for the absolutely splendid color theme, <i>minimalism</i>, and overall cohesive theme. After reopening, Thomas wants to address the following concerns to fine-tune the site.</p><ol><li>Word usage and vocabulary </li>
				<li>Ideas for the extra section</li></ol><p><b>Introduction</b> | <i>5/5</i></p>
		<p class="indent">In the introduction, the visitor knows the owner, what the site offers, and its mission statement. There is <strong>no question</strong> about where the introduction is because it is immediately the first content box you notice when visiting Buttoneer. You have a unique eye for detail and <b>visitor continence</b> because of the request status under the introduction. Visitors don't have to scroll far, or guess, whether requests are open. The request status graphics communicates it all and it stands out. But, it doesn't overpower your small introduction. It's an outstanding balance between the two. </p>
		<p class="indent">There are a few suggestions I <b>recommend</b> to consider editing in your introduction. Any suggestions I remark here do not one-hundred percent warrant a change, but it will <i>slightly</i> improve an already great welcome message! </p>
		<blockquote id="s">I am to provide you with the perfect button for your needs! Not sure what you need? Feel free to send me a neomail and I will do my best to help you out! Know what you need? Feel free to continue down…" </blockquote>
		<p class="indent">It's safe to remove "any of" because its inferred one's needs are taken care of at a request site. We can rephrase "a neomail my way" to " me a neomail," so the sentence is reduced by two syllables. An argument can be made that this phrase is justified because it is your personal writing style. Finally, there is no need for the word "on" because it's redundant and the term "continue" infers scrolling to the requests. </p>
		<p class="indent">Lastly, your updates are placed <b>nicely</b> next to your welcome section. I suggest making your updates section slightly bigger <strong>in the future</strong> because you update pretty frequently. Smaller div boxes could cause <i>inconvenience with difficulty reading</i> to visitors if you're writing a lot of content in confined spaces. </p>
		
		<p><b>Spelling and Grammar</b> | <i>5/5</i></p>
		<p class="indent">Overall, I didn't find many spelling or many grammatical errors on Buttoneer. However, in your request, elevated vocabulary was an area of concern. So, I will do my best to <strong>provide recommendations</strong> to elevate sentences without making them too pretentious. I will put original sentences in block quotes and afterward offer feedback that could warrant a change. Let's get started! </p>
		<p class="indent">Under the basic request's description, I recommend removing the word "already" at the end of the sentence. Where it's placed right now, the word is interacting with multiple subjects. It's end placement forcibly interacts with "want," which is a verb. If we move it to the middle of the sentence near "idea," the sentence has more clarity. However, "already" is an adverb, so we don't even need it in this sentence! It is your choice if you want to keep it or remove it entirely. </p>
		<p class="indent">Under the custom request description, there is no need for capitalization in the middle of the highlighted area <strong>unless</strong> it is a well known noun, name of someone, or place. Additionally, under the border section, I suggest removing "to me" because the word "describe" implies this. We know this because if we altogether remove "to me," the purpose of the sentence remains the same with or without the two words. </p>
		<p class="indent">In animation, remove the comma. We need to <strong>replace it with a period or a semicolon</strong> (if you're feeling fancy.) There are multiple comma rules, but one that I find helpful for everyone to know when to use them is <b>the switch rule</b>. If we can swap the two sentences in between coordinating conjunction and they make sense, we can use a comma. If we swap the two sentences and the meaning is completely lost, we need to change the punctuation to a semi-colon or period. </p>
		<p class="indent">Additionally, in the note, there is no need for a comma here. Even though we have a coordinating conjunction, if we apply the swap rule, the sentence doesn't retain its meaning, so we must use a period or semi-colon again. </p>
		<p class="indent">On both the custom and basic request sections, capitalize the beginning of "you read the rules right?" </p>
		<p class="indent">Regarding uniformity, I suggest changing the pickup section title to <strong>match the navigation name or vice versa</strong>. A majority of your mistakes are minute and won't affect your score. </p>
		
		<p><b>Organization</b> | <i>10/10</i></p>
		<p class="indent">I am very impressed by your attention to the organization on your site. Requests on your home page are <b>evenly spaced</b>, the padding on your content boxes is even all around, and the custom requests <strong>utilize their space</strong> wonderfully. Your pickup section is inline and not cluttered because of the margins you use to separate each button. Additionally, the sitely and credits area is organized very well. The placeholder buttons for your affiliates give the space a structural skeleton to keep everything organized. </p>
		<p class="indent">I recommend moving the <b>font section</b> under the custom request to the <strong>top of the list</strong>. The examples for borders and animations can wash out the little section at the end. If someone requests a custom button, it would be easy to overlook the section, so if we <b>relocate</b> it to the very top of everything, it'll be easier to notice and not overshadow. </p>
		<p class="indent">Lastly, I highly recommend aligning your text in the rules to the left because it looks slightly clutters and increases the reading difficulty. All lists and paragraphs over three to four lines should always have their text aligned to the left. </p>
			
		<p><b>Layout Mech and Usability</b> | <i>9.5/10</i></p>
		<p class="indent"> This part of the review is taken out because there is something in Neopet's filters that is not allowing me to save my pet pages. But I will briefly explain why you lost -.5 points. Navigating through the request area was a little tricky. Just reword the sentence to get back to the rules. That's all! </p>
			
		<p><b>Aesthetics</b> | <i>5/5</i></p>
		<p class="indent">The color scheme you use is simple and is unified together through the entire layout. Pops of yellow in the navigation and your italics elevate everything through all the blue. The small but <i>essential banner</i> beside the welcome message references the underwater theme. It divides the content box so there is variation in shapes in the layout. Additionally, the site's title has subtle notes of drop shadows and inner shadows, giving it an extra oomph of excellent details. Everything on the layout takes advantage of the margin: auto; an element that always centers the layout perfectly to fit any screen size. Amazing job designing and having a keen eye for small details.</p>
		<p class="indent">My only suggestion is minute but it would further create seamlessness on your site. For your updates header, I recommend making the header float to the left or be placed on the left. So that it <strong>mirrors</strong> the welcome title. However, an argument can be made that it is <strong>already reflecting</strong> the welcome header differently. This is entirely up to you if you'd want to adjust this.</p>
			
		<p><b>Content and Quality of Service</b> | <i>9/10</i></p>
		<p class="indent">Service at Buttoneer is <strong>incredible</strong>! You promptly respond to neomails in a timely fashion and follow your mission statement of finishing buttons quickly. Your buttons are beautifully crafted and visually attractive, but I have a few suggestions to improve your buttons further.</p>
		<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hybBBTG.gif" border="0"></center>
		<p class="indent">This button is one of my favorite recent buttons you've created. The animation is a subtle twinkle of glowing green rocks that <strong>attracts the attention</strong> of a prospective visitor to that person's page. The color scheme <i>effortlessly</i> translates to the text's border and inside color. The text placement itself is interesting. It isn't directly centered nor completely on the right side. This can be considered a general misplacement, but the placement is great where it is because of <b>the background image</b>. The light from the image acts as a spotlight, and if the text were directly centered or placed on the bottom right, it would be a <i>missed opportunity</i> — overall awesome button.</p>
		<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vsoc4kf.gif" border="0"></center>
		<p class="indent">I can't say enough about this button. It is easily one of the best buttons you've made recently. The border looks like a candy wrapper which fits <strong>superbly</strong> with the candy land theme. The background image is perfectly cropped and sharpened enough to see the details of the image. Furthermore, the text editing is brilliant. By placing a darker-toned color behind the text, it stand out more and doesn't feel flushed out by the busy, open background. My only suggestion is the animation is too frequent, and there should be <i>more buffer frames</i> in between animations. Other than that, fantastic job on this button. </p>
		<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tjItlbL.gif" border="0"></center>
		<p class="indent">I enjoy the oranges and warmer tones in this button's image and border. I would recommend being careful with <b>over-sharpening</b> button images <strong>too much</strong> because there is a bit of pixelation in the large white circle near the character's face. Also, the texts need some work. Like the two above examples, you did a fantastic job using the background image to your advantage, if you apply the same principles to this button, it could be <i>amazing</i>! The base of the button warrants a larger text because of the vast amount of space. Right now, the text is pretty <b>tiny</b> and the area is underutilized. Using a larger font, like <b>Bebas Neue</b>, or a calligraphy font like <b>Hand of Sean</b>, would make it stand out even more because of the short name and the vast area to work with. </p>
		<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uGhUXbB.gif" border="0"></center>
		<p class="indent">This button's text blends a lot with the background and is <strong>difficult</strong> to see because the border around the word "pride" is not dark enough to distinguish itself from the background. It would improve legibility if the drop shadow behind the text was slightly darker. Possibly adding a gradient effect to the white inside the text would also improve legibility. Lastly, the animation is hardly noticeable because the background is already light. The sparkles could be replaced with a text disappear and reappear animation to make the text even more <b>pronounced</b> and increase legibility. I will give you the benefit of the doubt on this button because I know from experience how difficult using this image is. There are a lot of colors in the original image, and it's hard to detail and recolor. And you did a great job at establishing an amazing concrete color palette on a hard to use image. </p>
		<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/p3A8QJR.gif" border="0"></center>
		<p class="indent">Wow, this button. I am absolutely <b>in love</b> with it. From the color theme, the animation speed and color, text placement, the text's slight gradient, and background placement and editing, it's simply outstanding. Not to mention the <strong>unique border</strong> that creates an almost alien or ethereal feel to it. Your best button so far! Amazing job!</p>
		<p class="indent">Overall, I would recommend paying <strong>close attention</strong> to animations. At times the animation occurs <i>too quickly</i> after it's finished. When a button's animation appear too often it actually does the <b>opposite</b> and deters users from clicking on button. Buttons are like business cards and having a subtle and not too frequent animation often attracts more attention and clicks! Additionally, determine if a different text placement or font is needed according to the background's allotted image space. </p>
		<p class="indent">For your <b>extras section</b>, the possibilities are endless. Here is a list I've complied to start getting you thinking about what your extras section could offer:</p>

		<p><b>Link Audit</b> | <i>5/5</i> </p>
		<p class="indent">Everything on your site is easy to navigate and goes to the correct pages. Great job on being detail oriented and paying close attention to your affiliates and listers!</p><p class="indent">My only suggestion is in your pickup section. Link to the person's site with the button you made. It's a <strong>little</strong> change, but a <b>big difference</b> when users visit your site and want to check out where the cool button is going!</p>
		
		<center><b>Recommended</b> or Not Recommended </center>
		<p class="indent">Buttoneer is quickly becoming a favorite button request site in the site community. With quality service and an eye for detail, Thomas strives at innovating his button craft. Though there were a few tiny hiccups in recent buttons, Thomas is learning everyday and continually improves which is evident in his evolution of his portfolio. With a score of <i>48.5/50</i> I highly recommend Buttoneer to anyone looking for a button to represent their site and will <b>definitely</b> revisit again.</p>

	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	<h2>a list of common queries</h2>
	<p class="indent"><b>In your reviews, you sometimes mention brownie points. What are brownie points?</b><br>Brownie points are a made-up, benign system my primary school teachers used to give kudos or show appreciation toward their students. There was no actual value or exchange rate for these points, but it was a way for teachers to show their appreciation without displaying favoritism. This fantasy system still gave students the satisfaction of feeling appreciated for doing something nice for their teachers or fellow classmates. So in my reviews, to keep things unbiased and to acknowledge cool things, I give brownie points to my clients that don't affect the review in any way.</p>
	<p class="indent"><b>I don't agree with the review you wrote. What is the next course of action from here?</b><br>I am sorry you did not enjoy your review. In my reviews, I use my wide range of experience on Neopets and in real life to provide an excellent source of helpful feedback. Keep in mind my reviews are entirely <strong>my opinion</strong>, so you have every right to not agree with anything written. If you feel like you'd want a one on one review that's conducted in a conversational matter, <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=persict&amp;subject=Rereview+Request">let me know</a> so we may work something out.</p>
	<p class="indent"><b>I already got a review, but can you review my page again?</b><br>I would love to review your page again. However, I would suggest requesters read their review critically and absorb the suggestions. Consider adjusting your page, and once some changes are made, I'd love to rereview your page.</p><center><a href="#extras">Back?</a></center>
