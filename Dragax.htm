<h1>Feral</h1>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/week24/dragonfearie.gif" style="float: left;">A term used to describe a creature that does not share almost any human characteristics traits. Less commonly, it is used to describe a regular, non-sapient animal. <br>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1506.gif" style="float: left;">A quadruped, traditionally, means an animal which walks on four legs. This is mainly to distinguish them from bipeds, which walk on two.<br>

<div class="column">
<h1>Anthro</h1>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/t_1472.gif" style="float: left;">
Anthropomorphic animals are sometimes called anthro or morphic for short. Anthropomorphic is a word which literally means "human shaped" (from the Greek anthropos (human being) + morphe (shape)). It is used to describe a concept called anthropomorphism, or ascribing human characteristics to non-human beings or objects. Typically, this is used in reference to deities, which are usually given the form of humans. However, the word can apply to any non-human thing, including animals, plants, and inanimate objects. <br>

Words like zoomorphic and therianthropic also describe creatures on the animal-shaped end of the anthropomorphism spectrum, but anthropomorphic is the more widely used term in the fandom.

There are subtle differences between the terms for an animal that thinks like a human and an animal that looks like a human.</div>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/pirates/championship/0_100.gif" style="float: left;">*<i>TNT has stated that Humans do not exist in Neopia, so keep that in mind.</i>*<br><br>
A humanoid is a character with a basically human body, though it may be different from humans in smaller details of its physical appearance. These are common types of character in science fiction and fantasy stories, where intelligent fictional races are typical. <br>

In the case of some characters, these are upright-walking (bipedal) characters that are basically humans with animal fur/scales, tails, ears, antennae, and sometimes paws or claws.

<div id="seeking"><h1>General Physiology &amp; Behavior </h1>
<br>Dragons are inherently magical beings, and are warm blooded reptiles. They have no biological relationship to mammals.

<p>As far as senses, which varies slightly depending on species due to each one, they are superior in most ways to other creatures; like any predator, they have exceptionally acute senses, which only increase with age. Like avian creatures, they have excellent depth perception and comparingly good peripheral vision, able to see twice as well as a human in daylight; unlike avians, they have great night vision, and are able to see even when conditions have no light to offer, although in such conditions they cannot discern between colors.</p>
<p>Like a cat's eye, a dragon's eye has a comparatively large iris with a vertical pupil. This arrangement allows the pupil to open extremely wide and admit much more light than a human eye can. The sclera, or "white," of a dragon's eye is often yellow, gold, green, orange, red, or silver, with an iris of a darker, contrasting color.  To a casual observer, a dragon's pupils always look like vertical slits. If one were to look very closely into a dragon's eye, however, one could see a second iris and pupil within the first. The dragon can shift and rotate this inner aperture up to 90 degrees, so that the inner pupil can overlay the outer one or lie at a right angle to it. This ocular structure gives a dragon extremely accurate depth perception and focusing ability no matter how much or how little light is available.</p>

<p>A dragon's mouth features powerful jaws, a forked tongue, and sharp teeth. The exact number and size of a dragon's teeth depend on the dragon's age, habitat, and diet; however, a dragon's array of teeth usually includes four well-developed fangs (two upper, two lower) that curve slightly inward and have cutting edges on both the inner and outer surfaces. </p>

<p>All dragons share a common desire to collect treasure, be it precious, beautiful, magical or just shiny - indeed, the treasure in question needn't always be gold, and may sometimes be aesthetic in nature, ranging from popular artwork or sculptures or even rare books and tomes that might otherwise have an overwhelming monetary value.</p>
