<div class="title">MY PETITION TO TNT!<br>A BODY SHAPE COMPARISON</div><div class="subtitle">MUTANT KACHEEK VS BLUE KACHEEK AND<br>MARAQUAN MINCY VS PINK MINCY</div><br><hr><br><b><font size="2px">Hello, I know that when we talk about mutant pets we also talk about different poses and body shapes than their regular versions, the same situation happens with maraquan pets, they change a lot. It also happens with baby pets...<br><br>That's why you offer special clothes for maraquan, baby and mutant pets (because it would be crazy to redrawn every single clothe to be wear by them).<br><br>The thing is that regular Kacheek and Mutant Kacheek share the same body shape, I mean... their entire body is the same (excluding the brain, lol) so I wanted to know if you could make Kacheek owners be able to dress them as if they were just another regular color.<br><br>There is a precedent and I will use it to create my case, and, as the title say: I will talk about Mincys.<br><br>Why? Because Mincys can wear regular clothes on their maraquan version and have the same capability with the maraquan clothes for their regular versions :P. The benefit is reciprocal!<br><br>Let's see a comparison betwen both species and regular/special colors...<br><div align="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uHngwzI.png" height="450" width="450" border="0"></div><br>As you can see: Both cases share the same body shape than their regular versions. But... ONLY MINCYS HAVE THE BENEFIT!<br><br>It would be a nice gesture and all you need to do it's to execute a script as you were doing to port clothes from flash to html5! (at least is what Scrappy and Gutterfoot said on the Producer Chat video)<br><br><hr><br>Do you have issues with the Kacheek head/ears? (even when Mincys, the precedent, also have a difference on their heads-ears-)... Below is the solution.<br><br><div align="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9LQ1t1v.png" height="450" width="450" border="0"></div>
<br>Convert the mutant brain in a paintbrush special cloth. TADAN!<br><br>I hope you can surprise us with this :)</font><br><font size="4px">Thank you TNT!</font></b><br></div><BR><BR><BR>
