<table border="2"><tr><td><strong>TL;DR: TNT partnered with a shady, non-Neopets friendly dev team to create rubbish looking cryptocollectibles in a way that was at best a scam and at worst the end of the Neopets brand as we know it. But then they canned the whole thing!</strong></td></tr></table><p><strong>Final update on the project's cancellation, July 2023</strong></p>

<p><strong>What's happening?</strong></p>

<p>On September 22nd, 2021 a press release was distributed announcing a new Cryptocurrency venture involving Neopets, known as Neopets Metaverse. This was from a reliable press release website that Neopets has used many times before. The announcement in full:</p>

<div id="backdrop"><blockquote><p>EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Sept. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Neopets is excited to announce a partnership with Raydium, an automated market maker (AMM) and launchpad powered by Solana, to bring a collection of NFTs based on characters from the  20 years of the Neopian history and lore.  The greater Neopets community will now have access to digital memorabilia from their beloved brand.</p>

<p>Over the past 20 plus years, nearly 100 million people have engaged with Neopets characters both in the game and through merchandise and other branded items.  Extending to NFTs give those users as well as NFT collectors the chance to experience and own part of the history of Neopets" says Jim Czulewicz, President and CEO of JumpStart Games, Inc., the company that owns Neopets.  "For us this is another opportunity to extend the brand into new markets and to new users in a format that is both modern and valued.</p>

<p>Collectors and fans will have the opportunity to acquire one of 20,500 equally unique, algorithmically generated lovable Neopets NFTs with variable backgrounds, assets, clothing, and personality â€“ 7 varying trait categories.  An official launch date will be shared as we get closer but look for the drop to be in early to mid-October.</p>

<p>Neopets is pleased to be partnering with Raydium's DropZone as one of the first on the platform.  Raydium's DropZone is an initiative by Raydium to promote the growth of NFTs on Solana while supporting project teams like Neopets with the infrastructure needed to launch the collections.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>***</p>

<p>Neopets itself made no such announcement (and still has not, really). In fact, initially the social media team were completely unaware the project existed or would be launching and incorrectly identified the project as a scam over Direct Messages.</p>

<p>This news was met with an immediate reaction from all parts of the Neopets community that can at best be described as lukewarm and at worst, outright livid.</p>

<p>A day later, on September 23rd, 2021, Neopets finally issued a statement on <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=161264216">their Neoboard</a>. It is interesting to note that this wasn't an official announcement of the project, but a response to the press release. Neopets itself has still yet to officially announce the project in this matter. Regardless, the full text of the message was:</p>

<div id="backdrop"><blockquote><p>Valued Neopians,</p>

<p>We want to thank you all for sharing your thoughts, feedback, and concerns with us regarding the new line of NFT's created in partnership with Raydium. We understand that our recent announcement may have created more questions than answers and we want to take a moment to clarify some information about the future of NFT's and Neopets.</p>

<p>Q: Is this a scam? Are you really making NFTs?</p>

<p>A: Our partnership with Raydium, Solana, and Moonvault is legitimate! You may have seen a recent photo from Neopets stating this is a scam; this was due to an internal miscommunication error, and we sincerely apologize for any confusion this statement may have caused.</p>

<p>Q: "Why are NFT's more important than releasing new features?</p>

<p>A: The good news is that they aren't! Please know that the NFT's in question were created by a partner company and did not impact the release schedules of the Neopets Team in any way; features and content have been developed and converted without interruption and we're excited to keep rolling out new features for the community in the future.</p>

<p>Q: "Why make NFTs?</p>

<p>A: JumpStart is always looking for new opportunities to drive our brands and product forward into the future. We are constantly seeking new ways for players to engage with us and we see NFT's as a potential opportunity for the company in this regard. We are going to learn new things on this journey and want to encourage everyone to keep sharing their thoughts and feedback with us as we go so we can improve and adjust accordingly.</p>

<p>Q: "Aren't NFT's harmful to the environment?</p>

<p>A: We've made an effort to partner with Raydium, a company that hosts their NFTs on Solana which strives to be a more environmentally friendly NFT solution than competitors. If you're interested in learning more about Raydium, check out their website here: https://raydium.gitbook.io/raydium/ or Solana here: https://www.solana.com</p>

<p>Q: "Why did an official announcement take so long?</p>

<p>A: As with any partnership, there are numerous groups involved and multiple moving pieces. We apologize that an official statement took us longer than we would have liked and we will be working internally to speed this process up in the future.</p>

<p>We understand that our venture into NFT's may not be for all of our players, but want to reassure you all again that their development is happening independent of the support we provide to the Neopets site and players. We appreciate all of our players and value the time you've taken to share your thoughts with us. We hope you will continue to do so, and that the answers above provide a bit of clarity into the situation.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>This confirmed the legitimacy of the project but did not address any of the key concerns the community had with it.</p>

<p><strong>So what is an NFT?</strong></p>

<p>NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. It is a form of digital collectible that exists on a blockchain, similar to those the famous Bitcoin uses. The technology of blockchains means that each NFT is verifiably unique. They are bought and sold using a variety of cryptocurrencies. However, it is important to note that while many NFTs are tied to digital artwork, what you are buying is *not* the artwork. You gain no rights to it whatsoever, nor any exclusivity outside of the NFT world. What you buy is essentially a digital receipt with the artwork on it. NFTs by themselves serve no other function.</p>

<p><strong>Why are people so mad?</strong></p>

<p>There are many different reasons people are opposed to NFTs, both in general and these specific NFTs. Here's a rundown of some of the most common:</p>

<p><i>- NFTs are a pyramid scheme.</i> NFTs follow many of the same principles as pyramid schemes and multi-level marketing schemes. Fundementally, due to the fixed supply of many NFTs, in order to maintain value in a secondary reselling market, demand must be increased. This means there must be an ever increasing number of new buyers to the market. Because these buyers are late to the market, they will see diminishing returns. This is, by definition, a pyramid scheme. Many pro-NFT individuals will try to deny this or try and quibble over <i>what type of scam it is</i>, but it remains fundementally true. NFTs exist as a bubble similar to the 'dotcom' bubble of the early 00's and housing bubbles that occur across the planet. As with any bubble, when it bursts, and it will, those who have not already cashed their chips lose out. Around six months after the Neopets Metaverse project was announced, many cryptocurrencies did in fact crash, including Solana, the currency the Neopets Metaverse project was at that time based on - losing 4/5ths of its value. In fact, the Neopets Metaverse project launched at the peak of Solana value. It has been all downhill since then.</p>

<p><i>- NFTs have a negative impact on the environment.</i> This was previously true, however there is an important qualifier. More well known blockchains like Bitcoin run on a technology that requires vast amounts of electricity. This equates to the total energy consumption of a small country. *HOWEVER*, Neopets Metaverse was originally slated to run on the Solana blockchain. This uses a different, quite new form of technology that uses vastly less energy, making it roughly equivalent to a large website at present. This is known as Proof of Stake. Solana will use more energy as it grows, but this will always remain vastly below other blockchains using older technologies. Pro-NFT users will often try to dismiss your arguments using this fact, often stating that the current banking system is far more polluting than Solana. This leaves out the truth that Solana is <i>very small</i> when compared to the global banking industry. Even Solana itself does not have any estimates on what its environmental impact would be if scaled up. After around 18 months, Neopets Metaverse switched to the Polygon blockchain, which runs on similar principles. Regardless, in general the NFT sector is now attempting to move away from the more enviornmentally harmful practices that previously dominated the industry. Ethereum, the largest blockchain in the NFT space, completed a move to a similar system as Solana in September, 2022. In general, when speaking about NFTs and in particular NFTs related to Neopets, the environmental impact is not globally significant.</p>

<p><i>- NFTs serve no purpose.</i> NFTs by definition offer nothing of real value. The art attached to NFTs can often be freely obtained elsewhere and enjoyed eternally simply by saving it to your computer. It is true that some NFTs are sold with extra uses, however typically in these cases what you are buying of value is actually the *other* stuff, the NFT remains just as useless.</p>

<p><i>- NFTs use stolen artwork.</i> This is not always the case but it is true that many NFTs have been sold by people who had no rights to the original artwork. There is no system in place to police NFTs and there is nothing to stop any individual making an NFT of any artwork they come across. In the case of Neopets Metaverse, Neopets owns the rights to the NFTs they are selling so it does not apply here. However, in order to generate the NFTs Neopets Metaverse did seemingly steal the coding off Dress to Impress (DTI), a Neopets fansite. More on that below.</p>

<p><i>- Neopets NFTs have been tried and failed before.</i> In 2018, Neopets launched a project called Neopets Cryptoquest that used similar NFT technology as a time limited collectible card game. It was vastly unpopular, selling only 1,819 card packs prior to closure. Both Neopets Cryptoquest and its parent company, Rarebits, are now non-functional. Players who purchased the packs report that they have been unable to sell the NFTs as they now hold no value.</p>

<p><i>- These NFTs are ugly.</i> Neopets Metaverse originally intended to create 20,500 NFTs, keeping 500 back for staff and giveaways, and selling 20,000 of them. They have since modified this plan and only created 10,000 for public sale. They are randomly generated Neopets customisation images via an AI. Each Neopet is a random species, colour, gender, emotion, and is wearing a random shirt/dress zoned wearable, hat zoned wearable, and background zoned wearable. This results in literally millions of possible combinations. Unfortunately, the majority of these customisations look like a dumpster fire. Some examples on the official website are below. These were randomly generated at launch. You have no choice in what the NFT will look like.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wft9wqG.png" width="300"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zhS8Avu.png" width="300"></p>

<p>Additionally, the Metaverse team has been asked repeatedly about customisation special cases. For example, if baby, maraquan, and mutant pets would be excluded due to their inability to wear most clothing items, or Vandagyres being unable to wear items made before the species was released. The Metaverse team have bluntly refused to address these concerns, and it turned out they were only using a small curated list of the most popular pets as judged by the old Neopets.com popularity page. This suggests special cases had not even been thought of.</p>

<p><i>-NFTs are scam ridden.</i> The Neopets Metaverse staff have had to give out multiple separate warnings not to fall for outside scams intending to steal funds from Cryptowallets. Messaging app groups have been set up impersonating Neopets Metaverse and spam accounts regularly attempt to contact users in the Neopets Metaverse community via direct message. During the launch, a fake Metaverse site stole nearly a hundred thousand USD. <i>So what?</i> you may think, <i>Neopets has scams too!</i> This is true, but there is a key difference. On Neopets, if your account is stolen you have recourse. You can contact TNT to have your account reinstated. TNT reverse pet trades to return stolen pets, and even return stolen items in some cases. <i>By design</i>, there is not nor can there ever be a central authority on blockchains. If you are scammed, you have lost your stuff and there is no way to get it back.</p>

<p>The situation with scamming in the crypto world is so widespread that even the Chief Metaverse Officer, one of the key people managing the Neopets Metaverse project, has himself had his wallet scammed and lost all of the currency in it. This individual was subsequently promoted to the position of CEO. If the people <i>managing</i> Neopets Metaverse fall victim to scams, how can they claim to be creating a safe environment for users?</p>

<p>Additionally, many controversial events surrounding the project have occured since the announcement, which are listed below. This has further soured users against Neopets Metaverse.</p>

<p><strong>Okay, but some people must like NFTs, right?</strong></p>

<p>NFTs do have their supporters, even among the Neopets community that is overwhelmingly against them. Some people do buy NFTs to collect them. However, it is largely impossible to ever achieve a full collection of any NFT category or collection.</p>

<p>The far larger category of those into NFTs is people hoping to resell them for profit. For that, the Neopets community is seen as low hanging fruit. There are speculators that can and will try and exploit Neopets players into thinking they are getting a deal. Additionally, Neopets Metaverse is deliberately and openly positioning itself as a gateway towards full adoption of the crypto world for new users.</p>

<p><strong>What's a metaverse?</strong></p>

<p>This is a high level technology concept that doesn't really exist at this time. The general idea is that you buy NFTs that can then be used in multiple different locations for a specific purpose. For example, you could buy a weapon skin in one game as an NFT, and then log into a different game by a different provider and use that NFT to unlock the same skin in that game.</p>

<p>Due to the complexities of inter-company cross promotion deals it is incredibly difficult for this concept to come to fruition in any kind of mass market way. Given that Neopets.com exists on antiquated systems it cannot and will not be implemented into any metaverse project. However, it is likely that the platform Neopets Metaverse are building will offer cross promotion with other crypto brands. Effectively bringing them into the Neopets universe. This immidiately happened in the alpha for the game, when they released an Audius branded jukebox item as furniture.</p>

<p><strong>I've heard Facebook is making a metaverse. Is this related?</strong></p>

<p>Short answer, no. The Metaverse is such a vague concept that there are many different ways to interpret it. On the 28th October, 2021, Facebook announced plans to change their name to Meta in order to promote future plans they have for a Metaverse.</p>

<p>While the indie and crypto gaming communities view a Metaverse as explained above, Facebook's idea for a Metaverse is essentially the current internet, but accessed from within a 3D virtual reality application. The key, of course, is that Facebook would own it. The end goal is to move Facebook into a position where they come to define access to the internet going forward. Given the company's historical treatment of user data, this has many people concerned. But wider than that, VR technology will never reach the needed level of emersion to replicate real life until the human mind can be directly plugged into a computer as in the Matrix film series. This is still very firmly in the realms of science fiction.</p>

<p>Regardless, Facebook's plans for a Metaverse have absolutely no relation to the release of Neopets Metaverse. It was just a very unhappy coincidence that they happened around the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Who is making Neopets Metaverse?</strong></p>

<p>Neopets Metaverse is being developed by a team of developers based at Netdragon and not the day to day Neopets team. Confusingly, staff at Neopets Metaverse sometimes claim the opposite. Netdragon has spun this project off into its own company, which licenses the Neopets brand from Jumpstart. This new company is known as Neopia Meta Lab Limited.</p>

<p>Neopets Metaverse was also partnered with Raydium to deliver the NFTs, and both Cherrypicks and Moonvault to build the Neopets Metaverse site. Raydium has since stepped back from the project and Neopets Metaverse ended up delivering the NFTs themselves.</p>

<p><i>Raydium</i> is an online marketplace for NFTs built specifically to run on the Solana blockchain. They would originally have been the ones actually selling the Neopets NFTs. It was launched at the beginning of 2021. After a few weeks of delay which Neopets Metaverse called 'legal stuff', Neopets Metaverse decided not to launch on Raydium. The reasons for this are unknown, as is the extent of Raydium's involvement in the project going forward, if any.</p>

<p><i>Cherrypicks</i> is a technology company based in Hong Kong that started in 2000. Like Neopets, it has been aquired by NetDragon, so can in effect be considered a sister company.</p>

<p><i>Moonvault</i> is a venture capital company that started about 2 months prior to the launch of Neopets Metaverse. It was founded in Hong Kong by three former investment bankers.</p>

<p>You may also see <i>ChizComm</i> mentioned as the marketing company that initially gave out the press release revealing Neopets Metaverse to the world. They are based in Canada and have existed since 2013. They have worked with Neopets for many years.</p>

<p>Interestingly from the lack of their inclusion on the press release, it seems Neopets usual merchandising agent, the Carlin West Agency, was not involved in this venture. However, the lack of their inclusion may be an error as they have since been included in other announcements.</p>

<p><strong>How much is it going to cost?</strong></p>

<p>On November 5th, 2021, Neopets Metaverse announced that they would be selling the NFTs on a sliding scale, starting at 1 SOL for the first 250 NFTs sold through to 4 SOL for final 250. 1 SOL was at the time worth around 250 United States Dollars. This means a single NFT could cost anywhere between 250 and 1,000 Dollars.</p>

<p>The crash of cryptocurrencies since that point and the general lack of interest on Solana's secondary market have meant that the <i>entry</i> price for any of the less desirable NFTs in the original Neopets Metaverse collection (they call this 'Genesis') is around 1 SOL which is currently worth about 20 USD. It is currently unknown what price point the NFTs will settle on once converted to the Polygon blockchain.</p>

<p><strong>When's the projected release date again?</strong></p>

<p>Initially Neopets Metaverse claimed the project would be releasing early to mid October 2021. As that came and passed, it became clear that wasn't going to happen. For about a week, Neopets Metaverse staff continued to reference vague legal paperwork with Raydium (the marketplace where the NFTs would be sold) that was preventing the release. On October 22nd, 2021, Neopets Metaverse made a statement that there would be a delay, but declined to reveal why, or give a concrete timeline for when the release would actually happen - claiming that it would only happen in a 'few weeks'. They then eventually announced that the NFTs would be released on November 12th, 2021, without the involvement of Raydium. The game that came from this original collection of NFTs remained in development that has been pushed back several times over 18 months. The game was eventually cancelled in July 2023, with many of the assets being reworked into the game known as World of Neopia.</p>

<p><strong>What's this about Quidd?</strong></p>

<p>On October 19th, 2021, a company called Quidd posted a teaser image of merchandise that was clearly the silhouettes of three Neopets, with a statement that a full announcement would follow the next day.</p>

<p>Quidd is an online digital collectible marketplace hosting images for many well known brands that can be bought and sold for money. Again, as with NFTs, you don't hold any actual rights to these images. At present, these are not NFTs, but at some point in the future the company intends to allow users to 'mint' NFTs of some specific collectibles they own.</p>

<p>The following day, October 20th, 2021, the teaser was deleted, and the following day a corresponding message in their community was also deleted.</p>

<p>Quidd host regular Q and A sessions between users and staff, and on October 22nd, 2021, staff confirmed that the project has been delayed, specifically referencing that Jumpstart had requested the delay to put distance between another merchandise release happening at the same time. In other words, the Neopets Metaverse project has become so toxic that Jumpstart are fully aware it will financially impact the success of other merchandise releases.</p>

<p>The Quidd staff also revealed that the Neopets products they are offering will not be sold as 'mintable'. As in, they will not be sold as initially having NFT functionality. However, there will be the option to change this at a later date if Jumpstart wish to do so.</p>

<p>Quidd eventually released these collectibles on April 19th, 2022. They turned out to be generic images of the Neopets species in various colours, and repackaged stickers that had previously been available to buy for mobile phones. They was a low amount of quality control for these collectibles (Eyries, for example, were listed twice in the species collection, resulting in 56 species rather than the correct number of 55. Equally, there were spelling mistakes such as Elephente with an 'e' instead of the correct Elephante with an 'a').</p>

<p>Quidd also briefly tried to use their Neopets collections to promote their own internal cryptocurrency, $QUIDD. Every trade of a Neopets collectible would generate this currency. This addition was prompty cancelled within a day of the announcement.</p>

<p>At this stage it is unknown if there will be further releases on Quidd.</p>

<p>***</p>

<hr><p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>

<p>Despite only just coming into existence, Neopets Metaverse has already managed to make several missteps that have further fostered growing unrest with the Neopets community. Below is a timeline of the absolute trainwreck that Neopets Metaverse has been and continued to be right until its end.</p>

<p><strong>Stealing Art from DTI</strong></p>

<p>Soon after launch, users noticed that one of the sample NFT images on the Neopets Metaverse, a Dimensional Kougra, did not look the way it looks on the Neopets site (shown below comparison between the two).</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BzqD57v.png" width="300"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FVTCGz8.png" width="300"></p>

<p>A quirk of classic Dress to Impress (DTI), the Neopets fansite that mirrors the Neopets customisation tool, is that it includes image versions as alternatives to the native flash assets that existed prior to html5 conversion. These images are generated internally by DTI, and part of that process effectively flattens the images for Dimensional pets, causing them to look slightly different.</p>

<p>This visual artefact is *only* present on the image version of DTI. It does not exist on Neopets flash customisation, Neopets html5 customisation, the png versions Neopets exports from its customisation, or DTI competitors like Jellyneo's Wardrobe.</p>

<p>DTI is the *only* logical source for this Dimensional Kougra, since the method DTI uses to generate their images is dated. Anyone developing their own conversion tools would likely use more modern techniques and avoid the errors - as TNT have done in their conversion to html5. While this does not conclusively prove DTI was stolen from, it does heavily suggest it.</p>

<p>When called on this theft, Neopets Metaverse made no apology or statement of any kind, but altered the image of the Dimensional Kougra to that of a Chocolate Kougra to hide the fact that the theft had taken place.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for them, when the NFTs eventually launched it became clear that other assets also had the same errors as can be found on DTI, including their Wraith pets. DTI alledge, reasonably, that Neopets Metaverse took the flash conversion program from DTI to create their NFTs. DTI does not license this specific part of their site for public use.</p>

<p>To date, Neopets Metaverse have still yet to address this claim despite attempts to confront other parts of this timeline. This, too, is suspicious, as if no theft took place it should be comically easy for Neopets Metaverse to provide a walkthrough of how the NFTs were generated and refute this criticism. Neopets Metaverse have now taken to claiming it is difficult, if not impossible, to investigate the claim due to the change in staffing at the company. This seemingly ignores the possibility of contacting former staff or investigating the assets they produced.</p>

<p><strong>Retweeting NSFW accounts</strong></p>

<p>On September 24th, 2021, as one of their first actions after being revealed as officially associated with the wider Neopets brand, Neopets Metaverse tweeted a congratulations to another NFT offering that features *very* non-Neopets safe content. It cannot be discussed here exactly what it was, but rest assured, it does not fit with a site like Neopets.</p>

<p>After being called on this, instead of apologising or deleting the tweet, Neopets Metaverse instead chose to accuse the Neopets fansite Jellyneo of spreading misinformation by taking things out of context. For clarity, Jellyneo had screenshotted the offending tweet and did not remove any context. Neopets Metaverse did send the congratulations.</p>

<p><strong>Homophobic Moderation</strong></p>

<p>On the evening of the 28th September, 2021, a user posted a commonly known homophobic slur to the Neopets Metaverse offsite community (the nature of that slur will not be disclosed on this page for obvious reasons). When this slur was reported to one of the two moderators for the community, NinjaPengu, reacted in a defensive way. They initially claimed that automoderation of the term and 'variants' would require a PhD in Artificial Intelligence. For the record, the Neopets Metaverse community uses a commonly available 'bot' to automatically filter out offensive or otherwise rule breaking language. You just type banned words into the interface and they are automatically filtered. All it requires is use of the English language, not any qualifications. And any moderator should be familiar with how to use one.</p>

<p>In addition, NinjaPengu then refered to the report of the slur and the person reporting it as 'FUD'. This is a common term used in pro-NFT circles that stands for 'Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt'. It is a catch all term covering all criticism of NFT projects and its use is intended to dismiss such criticisms to maintain hype. It is similar to when politicians use the term 'Fake News' to dismiss unfavourable media coverage.</p>

<p>Despite having this slur reported to them, and directly acknowledging that they had seen it, NinjaPengu took no action to delete the slur until, after three hours of many users continuing to question why it had happened, the slur was deleted. Other users from within the Neopets Metaverse community rallied to the defence of NinjaPengu, often being rude and dismissive to those reporting the slur. To date, NinjaPengu has yet to acknowledge that he did anything wrong or apologise.</p>

<p>The other mod in the community, Acara, and the admins of the project also declined to intervene, suggesting tacit approval of his behaviour. NinjaPengu was additionally asked to explain how he came to get the position of moderator for the community if he had no knowledge of common moderator tools but declined to do so in a dismissive fashion, suggesting there may be something untoward about the situation.</p>

<p>Later, NinjaPengu then attempted to stifle discussion of his behaviour, deleting both links to the original conversation's timestamps and links to screenshots of them - citing nebulous rule breaches for the reasons. NinjaPengu then added the word 'gay' to the automoderation tool (confirming he did know how to use it all along), as a passive aggressive move to stifle all conversation on the topic regardless of context.</p>

<p>Again, throughout this users in the NFT community continued to support the mod's behaviour. Very few, if any, originating from the community outside of Neopets.com stepped in to question the homophobic dogwhistling and homophobia enabling behaviour.</p>

<p>At approximately 11 AM NST on October 4th, 2021, NinjaPengu was removed from the Metaverse community. Later, TNT posted an update to their official message board, shown below:</p>

<div id="backdrop"><blockquote><p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>Thank you all for taking the time to share your thoughts with us. We are aware of the communication issues with our NFT partner companies and are working to address them as soon as possible. The Neopets Team stands with and supports the LGBTQIA+ community; as such, we've taken note of your concerns internally and we sincerely apologize for any frustration this situation may have caused. We will be sure to pass your thoughts along to the appropriate/responsible parties and want to let you know that the moderator at the center of the controversy has been removed from their position. We also wish to clarify that the "Neopets Metaverse Discord" is not owned nor managed by the Neopets Team or JumpStart Games.</p>

<p>Additionally, we appreciate the time taken to share your concerns with us regarding NFTs.</p>

<p>We'd like to reiterate that the NFT's in question are being created by a partner company, and not by the Neopets team directly, allowing our development plans to remain uninterrupted. Please know we remain dedicated to improving the Neopets site and will have more site conversions, updates, and new features for you in the near future.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone,<br>
Petra, Gutterfoot, Scrappy &amp; The Neopets Team</p></blockquote></div>

<p>This message was later deleted and reposted with slightly different wording, removing mention of Jumpstart games and the communication difficulties. Offsite, Petra (then a member of the Neopets team) confirmed that TNT have been under some form of gag order relating to the Neopets Metaverse situation, being limited on what they can say. Additionally, gutterfoot (then a member of the Neopets team) confirmed that the move to kick NinjaPengu had been in progress internally since the previous week but that TNT were waiting for Neopets Metaverse to actually follow through with that action before posting anything.</p>

<p>However, as detailed below, it seems that Neopets Metaverse might not have taken any action at all.</p>

<p>Regardless, later on in June 2022, it transpired that despite what was claimed, Neopets Metaverse would not be a different entity at all.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Sockpuppeting</strong></p>

<p>Immediately following the disgraced mod NinjaPengu being kicked from the community on October 4th, 2021, a new account joined the server. Timestamps confirm that this account was only created at 10:00 AM NST that day, an hour before NinjaPengu was kicked. This account, despite having no posts or otherwise notable activity, and not even having changed from the default avatar, was immediately given full admin and mod powers identical to those NinjaPengu held before he was kicked.</p>

<p>This account, Happymist, was briefly online after joining the community before immediately going offline so as to not appear at the top of the highly visible members online list. It seems possible, given that Neopets Metaverse appeared to have dragged their heels in kicking NinjaPengu, that this was merely him rejoining under a differently named account.</p>

<p>Later in the project's development, Happymist posted with insights only a dev actually working on the project would have, suggesting he was more than 'just' a mod. It seems strange that someone actively working on developing the project would not have been in the community at the start, further suggesting it was an alt account for NinjaPengu.</p>

<p>When the community management and moderation teams were revamped in 2022, the Happymist account lost its admin roles. It is unknown if Happymist is still working at the company, or is active under a different account. As with the DTI issue, Neopets Metaverse has yet to make any statement about this.</p>

<p><strong>Contrversial Plans for the Project</strong></p>

<p>Two 'community managers' who had been present in the Neopets Metaverse community since the start but had remained silent began to remodel the community starting on September 30th, 2021. Community mods identified them as working for a 'community management agency' that works for blockchain projects. As part of this, they accidentally made a private channel intended for staff reference public. Included in this channel was curated feedback gathered in private by mods from members of the community they valued.</p>

<p>Included in this feedback that was seen prior to the channel being made private again were suggestions for the future direction of Neopets Metaverse. These included the ability to launch unofficial (and thereby unregulated) spin off projects using official Neopets NFTs, introducing an NFT currency similar to Neopoints to use in these projects, allowing people who buy the original NFTs to create NFTs of their own pets, and perhaps most controversially of all to press the Neopets Team to push out the launch of Pet Slots and UC pets ahead of time in order to distract the Neopets community from the NFT project, allowing it to continue unimpeded. This is further evidence of a calculated effort by pro-NFT users to astroturf discussion on the project and undermine the Neopets community.</p>

<p><strong>Beauty Contest Winners</strong></p>

<p>On Friday 1st October, 2021, the results of the weekly Beauty Contest were released as usual. The first place winner of that week, nenislinds, featured an anti-NFT sentiment, as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="//upload.neopets.com/beauty/images/nenislinds-2021-09-24.jpg"></p>

<p>Initially, kikocat, the Beauty Contest judge posted a board on the Art Neoboard congratulating the three podium winners as is usual each week, and naming them. However, soon after this board was deleted and replaced by another by kikocat offering generic congratulations without directly naming them.</p>

<p>At the same time, the New Features updated for the day and no image of nenislinds was displayed. It is a matter of tradition that first place gets featured on the New Features update announcing the winners. In nenislinds's place, the second place winner was displayed. On the actual Beauty Contest winner's page, nenislinds was completely removed, showing only the second and third place winners. However, nenislinds was awarded the trophy, confirming that they had not been excluded from the competition, but rather <i>hidden.</i></p>

<p>After furious backlash from the Beauty Contest community, TNT eventually relented and nenislinds was added back to the Beauty Contest winners page. However, they were not added to the New Features, and the image used to represent nenislinds on the Beauty Contest winners page was altered to be lower resolution than normal, resulting in the anti-NFT slogan becoming less visible.</p>

<p>So far, this is the only movement the Neopets site team have taken on the NFT issue after the original statement, and while they may have eventually relented, it is clear the original intent was to scrub anti-NFT winners from creative contests.</p>

<p><strong>Transphobic Behaviour of Mods</strong></p>

<p>In the early morning of the 4th October, 2021, a temporary community manager acting as a mod in the Neopets Metaverse community was asked to intervene against multiple deliberate misgenderings of an individual. Additionally, they were asked to intervene against prolonged harassment of individuals. Rather than taking action, the mod, named Sake, advised reporters to ignore the behaviour. But he did take the time to post that anyone the Neopets Metaverse moderators thought was 'FUDing' (the NFT word for criticism) would be kicked from the server.</p>

<p>As with the previous prejudicial incident, members of the Neopets Metaverse community continued to egg each other on and defend mod behaviour.</p>

<p>Sake eventually did offer an apology in a generic sense without actually really understanding what he was apologising for. Sake was later removed along with the rest of the community management agency accounts.</p>

<p><strong>The Original Roadmap</strong></p>

<p>On October 7th, 2021, Neopets Metaverse released their roadmap, a high concept blog intended to reveal what the ultimate goal of the project was. It revealed that the staff intend to mirror all gameplay currently on the main Neopets site, including exploring/taking care of your pet, items, shops, etc. This would essentially create a fork of the Neopets experience, with all content instead being NFTs or comparable tokens.</p>

<p>It isn't hard to see that if such a project was to come to fruitition, Neopets Metaverse would begin to see the lion's share of Jumpstart's resources, as an NFT based game could generate many orders more income than the regular Neopets site ever could. This plan, therefore, directly contradicts TNT's initial statements that Neopets Metaverse would not impact on Neopets.com development.</p>

<p>Additionally, the roadmap revealed that Neopets Metaverse intends to use a variation of a pay to win model they are calling play to earn. This would essentially allow you to earn real life currency through playing Neopets, but it would require a significant buy in of currency in order to play in the first place.</p>

<p>The roadmap ended with a controversial 'stage 3' plan, where Neopets Metaverse intends to go hands-off in terms of development, allowing the community access to develop their own Neopets NFT-based apps and vote on which content they would most like to see. This would allow users to dictate the future of the brand without any oversight by Neopets Metaverse or TNT.</p>

<p>The Neopets Metaverse team signed this blog from both themselves and TNT, using the blanket term Neopets, Inc. This implies that TNT have somehow signed off on these plans, but it is currently unknown if that is the case.</p>

<p>While most if not all of these plans do seem like a flight of fancy, it is important to note that they were nevertheless Neopets Metaverse's intended plans.</p>

<p>An updated roadmap was slated be released in the first week of February, 2022. More on that below.</p>

<p><strong>Insulting the Neopets Community</strong></p>

<p>Early in the morning of October 10th, 2021, Neopets Metaverse posted a thread of tweets on their official Twitter account (which, as a reminder, contains official Neopets branding). It was the second series of tweets designed to 'educate' people who the staff view as ignorant of basic information about NFTs. While the first series of tweets focused on the environment and sought to play down Solana's impact versus older blockchains like Bitcoin, this second series of tweets was something entirely different.</p>

<p>This series intended to dispel 'myths' around NFTs in general, including many of the points listed above. It did so by mischaracterising arguments, dodging or otherwise deflecting points, and sometimes entirely ignoring them. But this was not the issue with the tweet chain. Below is pictured the first tweet in the chain:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/R8C4wJB.png" width="300"></p>

<p>To be clear, the first tweet in a chain attempting to 'educate' Neopets users began with a meme ridiculing them. Implying that the reason users dislike NFTs is because they are stupid. Many pro-NFT users within the Neopets Metaverse community have agreed with and shared this view before.</p>

<p>For context, this was the first communication on any officially branded Neopets channel since the start of a three day long 'blackout' by Jellyneo that was joined in an informal walkout movement by many users.</p>

<p>When the poor quality of this tweet was pointed out in the Neopets Metaverse community, a mod named j0hn stepped in to offer a flippant response. The tweet chain remained up for 3 hours before eventually being deleted. Neopets Metaverse made an apology later that day. The Neopets Team also made a similar apology the following the day, also stating that would be taking over running the Neopets Metaverse social media accounts and assisting in the moderation of the Neopets Metaverse community. It is important to note that this directly walks back the previous statement that Neopets resources will not be involved in the Neopets Metaverse project.</p>

<p><strong>Doxxing a Minor</strong></p>

<p>On October 12th, 2021, a 'raid' took part against the Neopets Metaverse community organised by a community centered around the game Roblox. This involved many of their accounts joining the Neopets Metaverse community and spamming it with junk messages. Such was the volume that the Neopets Metaverse mods had to briefly shut off posting of messages.</p>

<p>Once the spam was deleted and all the accounts posting it were removed from the Neopets Metaverse community, the Neopets Metaverse mod xBunny, took a moment to share, unprompted, details of one of the raiders. xBunny posted a screenshot of an account's profile with their social media handles listed. Helpfully, xBunny highlighted the social media handle for users to see. It is important to note that the information was gained from a private channel that normal users could not access. The messages and account had been deleted from the community, meaning there would be no way for regular users to have accessed this information without the intervention of a mod. Releasing identifying information in this way is commonly refered to as a 'doxx'. To make matters worse, the account belonged to a minor who briefly locked their social media profiles out of fear of incoming harassment.</p>

<p>Only after users pointed out that a moderator should not be engaging in doxxing behaviour did xBunny relent and delete their message. Later in the day, fellow mod CM Dean posted a message confirming that xBunny had been removed from their position as a mod on the Neopets Metaverse project, and apologised for the behaviour. The apology contained examples of victim blaming (because the user had been raiding) and deflection (that the information was on their profile - even though no one would have been able to access it).</p>

<p>Further, due to the near constant drama originating from the Neopets Metaverse staff and community resulting in negative feedback being regularly shared in the Neopets Metaverse community, CM Dean announced that any such feedback posted in their general channel would be deleted and should instead be directed to their much less visible feedback channel. CM Dean was himself later removed when the staff transitioned to a new group in 2022.</p>

<p><strong>The Launch</strong></p>

<p>Neopets Metaverse finally announced the launch date of their NFTs on November 5th, 2021. They slated this for November 12th, 2021, at 1:00 AM in the morning NST and would last through until November 15th, 2021. They also announced that they would be slashing the number of NFTs sold by ten thousand, and most importantly Raydium was being cut out of the launch.</p>

<p>Raydium's lottery system attempts to cut down on the amount of bots buying up NFTs. Neopets Metaverse decided to abandon not only Raydium but their lottery system, too. Instead, the NFTs would be launched first come first serve, on a sliding scale of pricing between 1 SOL and 4 SOL. There would be no bot protection whatsoever, and because each transaction would allow up to 10 NFTs to be purchased at once, this effectively meant that bots would be able to buy up all the 'cheap' NFTs instantly, leaving genuine humans with the most expensive versions.</p>

<p>This move proved deeply unpopular with members of the Neopets Metaverse community, who had previously been loyal to a fault and often enforced strict lines of positivity to the exclusion of others. These users felt they might need to resort to botting themselves - the equivalent of cheating in Neopets shops to buy up items - in order to stand a chance at getting an NFT.</p>

<p>Although the price of SOL fluctuates, if all the NFTs were to sell, Neopets Metaverse would have stood to make in the region of 7 million USD from the sale at that point.</p>

<p>The launch went as well as could be expected. Despite cutting the available NFTs by half, Neopets Metaverse still failed to sell out. Bots managed to take the first two price tiers within a minute of the official project launch time due to it launching slightly early by mistake. This meant that the minimum a genuine person might expect to pay was 2 SOL, at that point around 500 USD.</p>

<p>Interest in buying the NFTs quickly evaporated. By the end of the sale time, they had only sold 4,233 NFTs. Less than half of the available supply. In an attempt to increase the fear of missing out, Neopets Metaverse announced half way through the sale that any unsold NFTs would be 'burned'. This is a crypto term that means sending it to an inaccessible wallet where it can never be retrieved, as it is impossible to actually delete NFTs from blockchains.</p>

<p>After the initial sale, where users bought a token using a Neopets mystery capsule image, users were able to 'mint' the Neopets NFTs. They looked just as awful as the sample ones and fears raised prior to the sale were realised.</p>

<p>Neopets Metaverse revealed that only 10 Neopets species would actually be available, and only in 25 colours. This bypassed the problems with wearability of items by excluding Vandagyres and special body types like Maraquan or Mutant. Unfortunately, the two emotions they picked were happy and <em>sad</em>, resulting in half of the NFTs being images of crying Neopets. That people spent roughly 500 USD on. Sad Neopets NFTs quickly decreased in value to below the original sale price. Only 29 wearables in each of the two zones were available of the literal thousands that exist. And they weren't even good ones.</p>

<p>Despite picking species and colours to avoid the worst of the customisation issues, they <em>still</em> managed to fall foul of the system due to layering and flash conversion. Users quickly noticed that the Wraith and Eventide coloured NFTs did not look like they did on Neopets. The Wraith pets were either missing their glow or had it flattened, and the Eventides were similarly flattened. See below.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GORrpSY.png" width="200"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LqQcfFu.jpg" width="200"></p>

<p>Additionally, species such as Xweetoks and Unis had layering issues where items that would normally remove parts of their bodies to make them look better did not do so. See an example below of a Xweetok's head hair not being removed.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XecmHUQ.jpg" width="300"></p>

<p>As a result of all this, Dress to Impress renewed their criticism of the project, because again the errors with Wraith and Eventide are the <em>exact same ones</em> present on the old version of Dress to Impress's flash converter. Dress to Impress feared that Neopets Metaverse may have stolen their flash converter to make sense of the flash assets TNT had provided, and then layered the images themselves (incorrectly). Dress to Impress expressely forbids this kind of use of the technology.</p>

<p>Following the sale, users were allowed to resell their Neopets NFTs on select marketplaces. The first they picked, Neopets Metaverse initially forgot to turn on the royalties feature, meaning they were getting no money on additional sales, before remembering and setting on a final figure of 5% for each future sale.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, a scam website was set up to look identical to the Neopets Metaverse account along with a mirrored Twitter account. Many users were directed to this false site instead and ended up having their currency stolen. By the time the Twitter account was suspended, the scam wallet had gained roughly 75,000 USD in cryptocurrency. Although Neopets Metaverse were not related to the scam website, it is important to note that their last minute switch away from the more reputable Raydium site facilitated the scam as users were unfamiliar with which site they <em>should</em> be using.</p> 

<p>Finally, immediately following the sale 100 extra capsules were minted in the Neopets Metaverse wallet, and 5 converted into Neopets NFTs. 4 were then removed from the wallet, three of which then resold on the open market. When called on this, Neopets Metaverse claimed that an issue with the smart contract, the technology that allows minting and transfers, had allowed someone to generate extra NFTs. The 95 that were not transformed into Neopets NFT were slated for burning. However, it isn't difficult to see that there would be suspicions that Neopets Metaverse staff minted them themselves to profit off the sale.</p>

<p>All in all, the launch was a bit of a mess.</p>

<p><strong>The Netdragon Statement</strong></p>

<p>On November 19th, 2021, Netdragon released a press statement following the Neopets Metaverse sale. It read:</p>

<div id="backdrop"><blockquote><p>NetDragon Websoft Holdings Limited ("NetDragon" or the "Company"; Hong Kong Stock Code: 777), a global leader in building internet communities, is pleased to announce that Neopets, Inc, owned by its subsidiary JumpStart Games, successfully completed a sale of digitally created NFTs (non-fungible tokens), known as The Neopets Metaverse Collection.</p>

<p>The sale of the NFTs took place from November 12th through November 15th, with the NFTs minted on the Solana blockchain network. In total, 4,233 NFTs were sold in exchange for a total of 8,708 SOLs (Solana network's native cryptographic tokens). Combined with the ETHs previously purchased in the market, the NetDragon group currently holds over US$40 million worth of cryptocurrencies. </p>

<p>Importantly, the NFT sale garnered very strong interest from both the existing Neopets community as well as the vibrant blockchain enthusiasts' community, with more than 32,000 followers of our NFT project registered over the last two months on social media channels dedicated to this project. The strong following signals significant demand for digital memorabilia and future developments behind the Neopets brand, which launched its online_  virtual world of Neopia and its beloved Neopets characters more than 20 years ago, becoming one of the most popular online games in history. </p>

<p>The proceeds from the NFT sale, combined with additional investments from Neopets and the NetDragon group of companies, will be used to further develop the next generation of games related to the IP across both traditional web and blockchain-based protocols, keeping Neopia thriving as we evolve from web 1.0 to web 3.0. </p>

<p>This successful NFT sale represents the Company's commitment to be at the forefront of technological change, and also is the first milestone that marked its entry into the metaverse space. Going forward, NetDragon intends to capitalize on the opportunities in the metaverse by leveraging its broad portfolio of metaverse-enabling technologies (including VR, AI, fintech, speech, hologram, etc.), as well as its core competencies in gaming and education, to develop industry-leading products and market to users on a global scale.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>*</p>

<p>As you can see from the statement, Netdragon clearly thought that, despite it being the singularly most reviled project in the history of Neopets generating considerable negative press outside of the Neopets community, it was a success. Despite selling only around 20% of the original slated supply.</p>

<p>Worse, however, was the assertion that the Neopets community were interested, when the reality could not be more different. Additionally, it stated that resources would be freed up to aid Neopets Metaverse in continuing from both Netdragon <em>and Neopets specifically.</em> This appeared to completely contradict the earlier statements from TNT that Neopets Metaverse would not alter the development of neopets.com. Be that resources in terms of staff or budget, Neopets Metaverse is now slated to leech from Neopets proper going forward.</p>

<p>Subsequent Neopets Metaverse staff in 2022 have attempted to walk back this part of the press release. They have claimed that the project is entirely self funded from the proceeds of the mint, and gets no additional funding from Netdragon or Neopets. This seems unlikely, given that tracking wallet payments suggests that Netdragon ultimately took a 40% cut of the ~2 million USD the launched earned. Hardly enough to finance a game development team long term.</p>

<p>Equally, they claim the reference to Neopets in the press release relates to the Neopets Metaverse project having heightened access to the Neopets IP rather than funds or staff. Given that Neopets Metaverse already had enough access to be sent assets from the Neopets team and make new ones themselves, this seems a very strange statement to make. It is unknown what 'extra' access there could even be.</p>

<p>Ultimately, where the money would have come from to finance Neopets Metaverse long term remains an unknown.</p>

<p><strong>The Survey</strong></p>

<p>On December 25th, 2021, Neopets Metaverse launched a survey seeking opinions on what the direction of the project should be going forward, showing that even two months after the project was announced, no real work had begun on the promised game.</p>

<p>The survey was launched by a cadre of 5 new staff that NetDragon had employed to run the project, all of whom completely lacked any qualifications or experience in any of the key domains needed to actually build games.</p>

<p>Word of the survey soon got out to Neopets users, who provided their feedback, most of it negative. Privately, the new Neopets Metaverse staff confided to project loyalists that negative feedback would essentially be disregarded.</p>

<p>Sure enough, on the 14th of January, 2022, the condensed results of the survey were released by Neopets Metaverse, with little to no negative feedback featuring.</p>

<p>The survey response did acknowledge that previous behaviour of staff was not acceptable, and correctly assessed that an apology was needed <i>but purposely fell short of actually providing one</i>, again showing contempt for Neopets users.</p>

<p>Further than that, the survey responses dictated that Neopets Metaverse would focus on having their game cherry pick all of the popular aspects of Neopets.com, all but confirming the original fears Neopets users had about the project.</p>

<p><strong>The Roadmap, 2.0</strong></p>

<p>Neopets Metaverse slated a second, more in depth and specific roadmap to release in the first week of February, 2022. They announced this to great fanfare, including a tweet about spinning the Wheel of Excitement (while using artwork for the Wishing Well). Additionally, despite the overwhelming dislike of the project, the main Neopets twitter account retweeted this announcement, wishing the Neopets Metaverse team good luck.</p>

<p>Roadmap 2.0 proved to be just what every Neopets player had feared it would be. It released on January 31st, 2022. to much fanfare. It confirmed that, despite what had initially been claimed by both Neopets Metaverse and TNT, Neopets Metaverse essentially intended to clone all gameplay elements of the Neopets.com site on a new blockchain version.</p>

<p>Hilariously, the roadmap projected that, despite no work on development of the game actually having taken place at that point, a closed alpha test of the game to be taking place in August at the latest, with a public beta taking place in 2023. For context, this is suggesting that development of the game would take a mere <em>7 months.</em></p>

<p>Despite the lofty, and perhaps unreasonably optimistic goals, Netdragon continued to invest in the project, hiring many more staff to implement the game and reaching out to 'advisors' in the form of private offsite communication channels for users who had been relentlessly supportive of the project despite its many, many, glaring faults.</p>

<p>Worse still, at around this time Scrappy, the long time Brand Manager for Neopets, resigned from her position at Jumpstart, and was very quickly followed by Gutterfoot, the Lead Producer for Neopets.com who had been acting as informal oversight over the Netdragon Neopets projects. While entirely unconfirmed, it isn't difficult to see that the timing of these two high profile departures may be related to these developments.</p>

<p><strong>Developing Games</strong></p>

<p>On the 24th of February, 2022, Neopets Metaverse released a community poll asking which classic Neopets game should be the first to be implemented in the game they are developing. This showed a choice of Faerie Bubbles, Turmac Roll, Hasee Bounce, and Meerca Chase II. Meerca Chase II, as the most iconic game, was a runaway success.</p>

<p>This is important for one very clear reason. In the Neopian Times editorial released on the 21st of January, 2022, TNT member Yarner had this to say regarding the possibility of more flash games being converted to html5 formats:</p>

<div id="backdrop"><blockquote><p>We don't currently have any game conversions in the works. The focus for the team is on the upcoming events by giving them a new fresh look and feel. We are also finalizing which pages we are looking to convert by priority.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>In other words, Neopets.com does not currently have the budget (either internally or via outsourcing as happened with the previous converted games) to make any games. Yet at the same time, Neopets Metaverse is actively taking suggestions as to where to begin. It isn't difficult to see that this is yet further evidence Netdragon are deliberately putting Neopets.com on life support while championing their own, competing, pet project.</p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that despite Meerca Chase winning the poll by a landslide, Neopets Metaverse seemingly chose to ignore it. When the trailer for the game released in May 2022, they had developed Turmac Roll as their first game instead.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the same week Neopets Metaverse, in an attempt to inject some sense of community into their otherwise dead communication server, launched a 14 day self-care challenge with Neopian takes on activities. Most of these were things like cooking a healthy meal or keeping fit, but the only one requiring any work on behalf of the Neopets Metaverse team was a daily Neopets trivia challenge.</p>

<p>Of course, the Neopets Metaverse team chose to simply copy the Daily Trivia from Neopets.com. Yet more evidence that, when faced with having to do even <em>the most minor amount of original work</em>, Neopets Metaverse instead choose to take the work of others.</p>

<p><strong>Species Previews</strong></p>

<p>Despite offering a relatively easy first quarter on their updated roadmap, suggesting they would provide key updates on the broad features the game would have, Neopets Metaverse managed to miss this deadline and provided only a handful of updates of the dozen or so promised by the end of Q1 in March 2022.</p>

<p>One of the updates they <em>did</em> deliver on was to provide details on what the Neopets in Neopets Metaverse would look like. On March 17th, 2022, a mere two weeks before the Q1 deadline, they released previews of three of the Neopets rendered in 3D: The Kacheek, the Shoyru, and the Kougra. (The original images are idle animations, but they are very high in file size. I have included static images below).</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/WoojDUD.png" width="300"></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tKuSbxD.png" width="300"></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KuDqCBL.png" width="300"></p>

<p>Additionally, they claimed that the remaining 7 Neopet species from the initial NFT mint (Acara, Bruce, Draik, JubJub, Lupe, Uni, and Xweetok) would also be available for the project's public alpha, releasing at latest in August.</p>

<p>No details on the actual gameplay surrounding these assets or how they would be interacted with were given.</p>

<p>Over the following weeks, the team continued to provide renders for Acaras, JubJubs, Lupes, Xweetoks, the Skeith Bank Manager, Turmacs, the Food Shop, and the Neolodge. Some looked better than others, but typically they were consistent with quality expected of a Jumpstart era project.</p>

<p>Interestingly, while the models for the Uni and the Draik eventually appeared in May 2022's trailer, we only finally saw a render for a Bruce in February of 2023, a full year later.</p>

<p><strong>Gameplay Overview</strong></p>

<p>In addition to a preview of 3D assets for Turmac Roll and the Bank Manager, Neopets Metaverse finally revealed their core gameplay loop on March 31st, 2022. This, along with a new website for the project, managed to keep each and every one of their items (in a loose way) on their roadmap for Q1. March 31st, of course, being the very last possible day, meaning they reached the finish line at the absolute last moment.</p>

<p>Neopets Metaverse's vision for the gameplay of their project is as follows:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8fgyOV7.png" width="500"></p>

<p>Given that Neopets Metaverse had at that point previously said Neohomes would be sold, it still remains unknown how the free to play element will fit in. However, it can be seen that Neopets Metaverse essentially want to mimic much of the core gameplay of Neopets (customisation, battling, collecting items) in 3D. Again, reinforcing that this project would be in direct competition with Neopets.com itself.</p>

<p>The updated website, meanwhile, contained a staffing list that revealed Neopets Metaverse at that point had 19 dedicated staff and a further 3 acting in an advisory role. None of these had experience of working with the Neopets brand prior, although one of the advisors was Jim Czulewicz, CEO of Jumpstart - confirming he still remained actively involved in the project.</p>

<p><strong>The Trailer and the Pizza</strong></p>

<p>On May 11th, 2022, Neopets Metaverse announced that they would be releasing a trailer for the game on May 22nd. They picked this date because it aligns with what is known as Crypto Pizza Day, the date on which the first real world object (pizza) was paid for in cryptocurrency. To celebrate the release of the trailer, Neopets Metaverse would hold a free mint of pizza-themed NFTs.</p>

<p>This collection of 5000 NFTs would be free (minus the small cost of minting), but exclusive to a whitelisted group of people. Owners of the original NFT project qualified, along with a few winners of social media contests. Additionally, Neopets Metaverse put their marketing into overdrive, partnering with a variety of other NFT projects to offer them spots. Hilariously, one project ended up flooding the Neopets Metaverse community with 5000 bots instead of anyone actually interested in the project.</p>

<p>The mint would be held on fractal, another minting site similar to Raydium that was meant to be used in the original sale. In a last ditch attempt to make sure this collection would <i>certainly</i> sell out, the 36,000 people who owned fractals own token were added to the whitelist. Being so terribly oversubscribed, and with a theme that tied more into the wider crypto world than anything Neopets related like Neggs or Omelettes, the collection unsurprisingly sold out in a few hours.</p>

<p>Importantly though, only half of the 'gold' whitelist, which was a closed mint prior to opening the floodgates for everyone on the list, decided to actually mint a pizza.</p>

<p>The pizzas themselves <i>were</i> themed to the Neopets items, in terms of having the same available toppings like water or jellybeans. However, Neopets Metaverse had decided to render them in realistic 3D, making them look odd to say the least. Below are some examples.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Rd1QFBZ.png" width="300"></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7B9eRy5.png" width="300"></p>

<p>Pizza NFTs were slated to give access to an exclusive item in the Metaverse game, and access to the closed alpha still slated for August 2022.</p>

<p>Following the mint, price of the pizzas fell as low as 0.12 SOL (around 2 USD at the time of writing).</p>

<p>The pizza mint quickly overshadowed the actual trailer, which got only around 200 views during the mint (of 5000 pizzas). However, it showed an open world 3D game with gameplay of Turmac Roll and a few other features. Again, quality had faults but was broadly of the kind expected from a Jumpstart era project.</p>

<p>Neopets Metaverse's site remains blocked on Neopets, so I am unable to link you to the trailer. Here are some stills.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Neopets Team on Neopets.com attempted once again to drum up support for Metaverse. Firstly, they posted a Neoboard thread that once again clarified their position while also encouraging users to view the trailer:</p>

<div id="backdrop"><blockquote><p>Dear Neopians,</p>

<p>We are now well into 2022, and as the team looks ahead to this year and beyond, we are filled with excitement and pride. What began as a project between two college students - an artist and a coder - has blossomed into an entire global community of artists, gamers, and defenders of 2000's internet nostalgia.</p>

<p>The spirit of Neopets has always been rooted in transparency, inclusivity, and community-building. We realize that where communication and transparency are concerned, we are always trying to improve and grow. And so, today, we pull up our chairs and join you at the table for what we hope will not only be a candid discussion about the state of the game, but a dialogue with the people who know and love it best: you.</p>

<p>Believe us when we say this: we are listening. We hear all of your feedback â€” ALL of it. In fact, we rely on it. We will not go into 2023 without you, our core players, at our side. We acknowledge that in order to build a bright Neopian future, we must look to the past, learn from our mistakes, and move forward with the community hand-in-hand.</p>

<p>In December, we installed a new Metaverse team whose goals and vision are more in line with ours, and we now have significantly better communication with their team and a renewed trust. We routinely liaison with the Metaverse team both to ensure the safeguarding of the Neopets IP and to advocate for the needs and wants of the Neopets community.</p>

<p>The development of the Neopets Metaverse is exclusive from the development of the Neopets.com that we all know and love. We are still building and growing the original game that we all adore â€” this is not changing. The Neopets Metaverse is a completely separate product with separate teams. We ask that you kindly keep an open mind towards the new Metaverse team and the project. That said, we understand that NFTs are not for everyone. Keeping Neopets.com and the Neopets Metaverse separate is key to our long-term strategy of preserving the integrity of the Neopets IP.</p>

<p>At its core, the Neopets Metaverse gives interested players the opportunity to explore their beloved brand in a whole new way. The Metaverse provides Neopians an opportunity to "choose their own adventure" in terms of how they want to experience Neopia. If the idea of a 3D blockchain-based Neopian ecosystem inspires you, consider taking a look at this project. If this style of game is not up your alley, then take solace in the fact that Neopets.com will continue to be here for you.</p>

<p>For those of you who are interested in the iteration of Neopia that will exist within the Neopets Metaverse, you'll be excited to know that the first game trailer releases on May 22 at neopetsmeta.io. We think that anyone who has ever fantasized about what Neopets would be like as a 3D game will be thrilled by what's in store.</p>

<p>We look forward to a bright future for Neopia in its various iterations and products, and we hope you come along for the ride.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>At the same time, Neopets posted a tweet encouraging players to check it out. To obfuscate what they were doing, they asked users firstly to post their favourite type of pizza for Pizza Day (note the lack of crypto). Actual Pizza Day is celebrated in February. The tweet got exactly the kind of negative backlash you would expect.</p>

<p>A month later, it transpired that in fact Neopets Metaverse <em>was</em> directly taking staff resources for its own devices, the opposite of what was claimed.</p>

<p><strong>Town Hall &amp; AMA</strong></p>

<p>On the 10th June, 2022, Neopets Metaverse held a Town Hall/AMA (Ask Me Anything) session that lasted a little over half an hour. Prior to the session they had requested questions which they then went through and curated a list of. This was a voice chat hosted by the project's Chief Metaverse Officer.</p>

<p>The majority of the session was a rehash of previously announced features and timelines. However, a few new details were revealed. Neopets Metaverse has a plan to release new content quartly for <em>at least the next four years</em> post release. Effectively suggesting that Netdragon seem to have given Neopets Metaverse a five year time frame to prove their profitability before being reassessed. Each of these quarterly updates are slated to include new Neopian lands, new available species, and new features/upgrades to existing features. Again, they were open about their ambition for the game to be a gateway to 'convert' people to the crypto world.</p>

<p>Although it had technically been included in the first, long since abandoned roadmap, they also reiterated plans for community voting on the direction of the project, both in terms of development of features and more specifically in the lore the game will have. Voting will be based on the amount of time users have 'staked' their NFTs (a term for essentially locking your NFT in a safety deposit box of Neopets Metaverse's keeping). Obviously, this means those with a vested interest in keeping their investments valuable will be in a position to make that happen, while free to play users would have no voice in the future of the project.</p>

<p>They also gave some details on the limits of free to play accounts, stating they expect such users to have access to 80% of gameplay. Specifically though, they said that they will not have access to seasonal events such as battledome pvp tournaments they compared to the Altador Cup. They also stated such events would have an additional entrance fee even for NFT holders. A marked depature for the Neopets brand where events have almost always been exclusively aimed at the free to play segment of the userbase.</p>

<p>Various other smaller details were revealed, like Battledome equipment being level locked, a hard limit of 3 Neopets per account at release, and that in terms of lore they hope Neopets Metaverse will take place in an alternate universe to the 'real' Neopia on Neopets.com. This would allow them to go in whatever direction they wish without having any accountability to the wider brand.</p>

<p>Despite having literally dozens of questions waiting to be answered, they picked less than half a dozen, including none about any of the concerns raised above. Neopets Metaverse announced there would be new AMA Town Halls every two weeks, and other questions would be answered in those. This was a promise kept to for only a couple of months.</p>

<p><strong>NFT.NYC 2022</strong></p>

<p>NFT.NYC is an industry convention in New York focused on crypto and specifically NFTs. It has grown in popularity year on year as NFTs have, but remains a relatively small scale event - despite a lot of bombast from participants to make you feel otherwise. Part of this may be because tickets can cost in the region of 800 USD. Regardless, it is still an event at the scale where celebrity impersonators are paid to attend to make it look as if it has celebrity involvement when it does not.</p>

<p>Neopets Metaverse announced that they would be heading to NFT.NYC as a Silver Sponsor. In addition, they would be hosting a food cart during the event. Silver tier sponsorship costs roughly 15,000 USD, and hosting a food cart costs roughly 25,000 USD, meaning a total sponsorship of 40,000 USD, not counting the cost of hotels and transport for staff attending the event, as well as the cost of merchandise given away.</p>

<p>Because there was merchandise. Alongside giving away pre-existing merch for free like the Geekify pins mere mortals using Neopets.com must pay 10 USD for, Neopets Metaverse also premiered exclusive merchandise for the upcoming Upper Deck Collectible Card series. Merchandise previously announced in conjunction with Neopets.com. This included physical representations of the cards but also exclusive digital packs of cards featuring the likes of Fyora and the Darkest Faerie. Given that Neopets Metaverse had previously never mentioned the Upper Deck merchandise it seems odd that they would be given first dibs on launching it over the main site.</p>

<p>Exclusive NFTs for convention attendees were minted, featuring entirely new Neopets artwork.</p>

<p>Additionally, while never implemented, the food cart idea had originally been planned pre-pandemic to be used for Neopets.com convention appearances.</p>

<p>In addtion to the food cart, Neopets Metaverse had a 'booth' (a small table) in the convention space where they demoed the Turmac Roll game from the alpha on a laptop. Attendees stated gameplay was changed to be a timed level, and there was significant input lag.</p>

<p>Worst of all, however, photos from the event and statements from attendees confirmed that at least three members <em>of Neopets.com staff</em> were in fact manning the booth. Given that it was a Neopets Metaverse event, at an NFT industry event, with absolutely no Neopets.com coverage or representation, this felt very odd, and at odds with the previous statements that there would be two distinct teams. While developed in Hong Kong, Neopets Metaverse does have staff in the USA so could have manned the booth entirely with its own staff if it had to.</p>

<p>Carlin West, the agency in charge of Neopets.com merch, also made a speech on behalf of the Neopets Metaverse project at the event's closing gala, despite originally not having any involvement in the project's launch.</p>

<p>All in all, the event suggested if not proved that the promises that Neopets.com would not be impacted by Neopets Metaverse, and that the funding for Neopets Metaverse was entirely coming from the original mint, were utterly false.</p>

<p>Seemingly in response, Neopets Metaverse hosted a brief AMA on the 24th of June, 2022, 'addressing' some concerns. They stated that Neopets.com staff were at the event because it was somehow a 'joint' event. As discussed above, the lack of any Neopets.com presentations, advertising material, or site coverage, shows that to be an utter lie. Neopets Metaverse additionally claimed that due to the event, Neopets.com had seen a boost in user numbers. Given that the AMA happened mere hours after NFT.NYC had ended, it is unlikely that Neopets.com staff would have (out of office hours) compiled user numbers over the event and sent it to Neopets Metaverse to view in that time. While possible, it is also likely that is a <em>lie</em>.</p>

<p>The AMA also confirmed that previous statements about the project being entirely funded by the initial mint were false. A second round of venture capital funding had taken place to get the required investment alongside additional money from Netdragon itself. Additionally, they admitted that members of TNT working on Neopets.com were having some of their time diverted to Neopets Metaverse, citing nebulous kick backs for that, without offering any details whatsoever.</p>

<p>The AMA also contained the rather bold claim that the NFT.NYC event had resulted in 2000 new followers for Neopets Metaverse on Twitter, which they somehow conclusively knew absolutely none of which were bots. Also mentioned was that they expected around 60 million prospective users for Neopets Metaverse. That's just over half of all crypto users globally at present. The hilariously bold estimate seems to have come from them estimating that around 40% of people coming to the booth at the event had played Neopets before, and using the 150 million total accounts figure for Neopets.com to somehow assume 40% of those would now play the crypto version.</p>

<p>Despite the NFT.NYC event essentially demolishing one of the key promises TNT made about their involvement with Neopets Metaverse, they remained entirely silent about their involvement with absolutely no statements from Neopets.com</p>

<p><strong>Ambassadors</strong></p>

<p>In the aftermath of NFT.NYC on June 25th, 2022, Neopets Metaverse announced a brand Ambassador program. This was to be a form of community council, an extension of the 'Matrix Neopians' which itself had secretly existed since just after the new year. These Ambassadors would be expected to answer questions about the project and promote the project to new prospective users, host AMAs, and generally perform all the activities paid influencers might be expected to. In exchange, they would be offered free NFTs, the ability to recruit their friends into the exclusive ranks of the Matrix Neopians, and a direct line of communication to Neopets Metaverse developers to advocate for changes to the game they wished to see.</p>

<p>Obviously, the prospect of a community council is not a bad one. Many users have asked for one to operate for Neopets.com in the past. But for it to effectively be a paid position, and one which actively lists nepotism as a benefit, is rife for exploitation and unlikely to end with anything that is good for the long term health of a game or brand.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, when the Ambassadors were revealed on July 14th, 2022, Neopets Metaverse had selected four very typical representatives of the project up to that point:</p>

<ul><li><i>Staceys</i>, a crypto influencer known to have created several NFT collections in the past who discovered the project at the NFT.NYC convention the previous month.</li>
<li><i>Elemental Stars</i>, a long time supporter of the project who has previously been dismissive of concerns Neopets users have about the project.</li>
<li><i>Tree</i>, a long time supporter of the project best known for sending harassing messages on social media to those critical of the project via alt accounts.</li>
<li><i>Code Cowboy</i>, a relatively silent user working for NFT marketplace MagicEden who immediately after being appointed went to an offsite Neopets community to troll them for ~8 hours before eventually being banned for saying that Neopets users 'had something worse than covid'.</li>
</ul><p>Code Cowboy was quickly removed from the Ambassador project following his behaviour, which he followed up by making legal threats against Neopets fansite Jellyneo for reporting on it. Tree, however, who expressed similar sentiment and whom Code Cowboy implied had suggested he engage in the behaviour in the first place, remained.</p>

<p>Neopets Metaverse later published new guidelines for Ambassadors to follow, which again Tree had breached multiple times in the past.</p>

<p>Following all this, Neopets Metaverse announced a 'Neopian Council' of players of Neopets.com in an attempt to include them in the decision making process of Neopets Metaverse. This has yet to actually transpire, and it is unknown how effective it would have been.</p>

<p><strong>July 14th AMA</strong></p>

<p>Another AMA session, this time held on Metaverse's Twitter Spaces, that existed primarily to announce the new Ambassadors, was held on July 14th, 2022. In it, the head of the Neopets Metaverse project revealed that the litepaper, due at the end of June at the latest, had been pushed back to the end of July. Additionally, a sale of 'native tokens' (those to be used in the game) had been pushed back to the winter due to the poor state of the crypto market at that point.</p>

<p>Specifically, they selected November 15th as the date. The birthday of Neopets.com and the exact same date the previous team had selected for the launch of the <i>first</i> NFTs, which completely overshadowed what should have been a celebration of the main site.</p>

<p>Additionally, it was revealed that the Meerca Chase game had previously been completed and would be ready for the beta - but for some unknown reason had never been previously stated as such, or shown in any capacity despite being a far more iconic, easily marketable, and popular game. It would later transpire in the alpha, that the reason it had not been shown off was because it looked rubbish.</p>

<p><strong>The Litepaper</strong></p>

<p>On July 29th, 2022, Neopets Metaverse finally released their long awaited 'litepaper', an overview of the expected gameplay less detailed in nature than a whitepaper, but still containing new information. Details within the litepaper quickly caused both concern and confusion.</p>

<p>Neopets Metaverse had been spun off from Netdragon as its own company, now known as Neopia Meta Lab Limited. This was ostensibly to insulate Netdragon from any fallout from laws in China and Hong Kong targeting crypto, but had the effect that Neopets Metaverse is now <em>licensing</em> the Neopets brand from Netdragon. This is important for the next point.</p>

<p>Despite the original terms and conditions of the genesis Neopets collection saying that the NFTs did not grant any IP or ownership rights, the litepaper proudly declared that the NFTs would all confer 'full' ownership and IP rights. This was a major development as the lack of any qualification or limits on that ownership would allow a user to pick up an NFT for 50 USD and then be able to legally produce any work they liked from that NFT (i.e. a Kougra) without oversight from Neopets. Given that Neopets has always had strict rules for this, and that current Neopets merch providers must bid for the contract and have each new merch piece approved from the brand, this raised eyebrows. The fact that Neopets Metaverse was also now licensing the brand rather than speaking with the authority of the brand's direct owner also called into question if they even had the legal authority to offer such ownership.</p>

<p>Sure enough, Neopets Metaverse soon claimed they were taking legal advice, and within two weeks had removed the section entirely from the litepaper, defaulting back to the no ownership stance of the original terms and conditions. Though, confusingly, immediately after this the project's lead claimed that future NFTs may include IP rights - despite them falling foul of exactly the same, if not more, issues.</p>

<p>Additional details revealed the currencies to be used in Neopets Metaverse. The paid crypto token would be known as Neopoints. But confusingly, the free to play currency players could earn through games would be known as Codestones. Given that canonically on site Codestones are <em>not</em> freely exchangable tokens, are objects of higher value than Neopoints, and are <em>literal rocks</em>, this seemed like an odd choice. Neopets Metaverse largely dismissed these concerns.</p>

<p>The litepaper also originally included an image of the Codestone currency using an image from Neopets merch provided Geekify's codestone pins. Neither Geekify nor the artist of the pins were consulted before the use of the pin image in the litepaper, yet a further example of Neopets Metaverse assuming they can freely take from the wider Neopets community (though in this case, it is likely they did have the technical rights to do so).</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tZsM4QG.png"></p>

<p>Again, just under two weeks later, the codestone image was replaced. Oddly, the image the created to represent codestones is a blue codestone. There are currently no blue codestones in Neopia. It also lacks any of the known codestone symbols.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/H6wgaMk.png"></p>

<p>The litepaper also included some ill-thought out announcements about how the paid crypto currency would be distributed. The tokens would be gradually made available over 4 years, with members of the Neopets Metaverse team and 'advisors' getting 20% of them for free by default. Only 25% would ever be available via actually playing the game, but because they would be gradually released over time this leads to the obvious problem that if a lot of people play early in the week, there may be no tokens left to earn for players later in the week. That the 'play and earn' gameplay touted by the project would only really exist by people capable of logging in first. Neopets Metaverse were repeatedly unable to explain how this problem would be avoided when asked.</p>

<p>Finally, the litepaper also featured the return of another aspect of the projects <em>original</em> roadmap claiming that the project would eventually become a 'DAO', a community owned game where players (<em>paying, NFT owning players</em>) would call all the shots. Again, with Neopets Metaverse's new status as a spun off studio licensing the game, it is unknown how they can legally make a claim that community members will have that kind of autonomy from the brand owner.</p>

<p><strong>The Treasure Hunt</strong></p>

<p>On August 15th, 2022, Neopets Metaverse launched a scavenger hunt as their first large scale event and partnership with other (crypto) brands. It was a simple scavenger hunt around pages on their website, similar to the early steps of some of the first, most basic Neopets plots. The first part of the hunt ran for a week before a second part, which expanded the hunt to partnership project websites in the same way. Prizes included NFTs and merch items from the recent Neopets.com plushie line.</p>

<p>The initial first week's hunt went relatively smoothly, despite issues around the Neopets Metaverse sowing confusion about what was needed, what the prizes would be, and how you would be able to continue into week two. However, the second week was a right old mess.</p>

<p>Several of the partner projects failed to put their clues live on their website, or in the correct places, on time, making the race to the finish impossible to complete for many. Additional, the content of some of the projects was highly questionable. In particular, one of the partners, XWG, had an NFT collection for one of their games featuring stereotypical anime women. They called this collection the 'Dream Card Bimbos'. Bimbo is a derogatory term typically used against women implying that if they are attractive they must also be stupid.</p>

<p>After significant outcry, Neopets Metaverse announced that they would not be working with XWG again.</p> 

<p>After the close of the event, Neopets Metaverse changed the prizes available to winners, removing some of the partner NFTs and not offering anything comparable in value in exchange. While the legal situation in Hong Kong is unknown to this author, in many locations across the world, changing competition prizes after the fact is illegal.</p>

<p><strong>The Alpha Release</strong></p>

<p>Despite the fact that they themselves had imposed a deadline of the end of August for the private alpha release, Neopets Metaverse looked on track to miss it. To get around this, they decided to expand the alpha to last all of September too, and release content in chunks so as to <i>technically</i> meet the deadline.</p>

<p>The chunks would be 3 minigames, interacting with your pet, neohomes, and the battledome. Oddly, the initial plan that was later reversed was to remove each of the previous chunks when a new one launched, limiting the amount of content available. As a reminder, access to this alpha required an NFT from Neopets Metaverse, meaning people theoretically <i>paid</i> for this access.</p>

<p>The first week of the alpha began on the 26th of August, 2022 with the 3 minigames. These were Turmac Roll (this had previously been available via a social media promotion earlier in the month), Meerca Chase, and Ultimate Bullseye. The three had been recreated in 3D and played reasonably if a little easy compared to their genuine versions on Neopets.com. Art quality outside of Turmac Roll was questionable.</p>

<p>Much as with the Treasure Hunt prizes, a slated high score table with prizes for Turmac Roll was initially advertised as having 10,000 USD worth of prizes. Neopets Metaverse then backtracked claiming no prizes would be awarded, before then deciding that prizes of pizza NFTs and Masterpiece NFTs from NFT.NYC would be awarded. The value of these came nowhere close to 10,000 USD. As with above, the legality of this within Hong Kong is unknown.</p>

<p>Embarassingly (and, again, potentially illegally) when announcing the high score table winners, Neopets Metaverse tweeted out their full, unredacted email addressess. This is normally highly private confidential information.</p>

<p>Part 2 of the alpha released on the 2nd of September, 2022. This involved dressing, feeding, and playing with with preset Neopets (a Shoyru, Kougra, and Xweetok). The models had suffered greatly from their initial reveal, looking much lower quality and the animations appearing more uncanny. Additionally, the majority of clothing clipped through the pets. Neopets.com real life merch clothing items had been converted to fit Neopets. Items had been uploaded to the game without names or descriptions properly entered.</p>

<p>Neopets had ratings for much of these interactions similar to the main site, such as a measure for hunger. When it came to playing with toys, however, the name of the measure chosen raised more than a few eyebrows. They selected 'intimacy' as a measure of how much the Neopet considered you their friend. This had obvious non-Neopets friendly interpretations, and it is unknown how this managed to make it past an internal review process as would be obvious to anyone familiar with the brand. It was later replaced with a different term.</p>

<p>Nehomes were released on the 9th of September, 2022. They had based their version largely on Neohomes 2.0 on Neopets.com, while removing some functionality, keeping some poor development choices from the original, and adding in new features like weight and a rating system to artificially limit what players can actually put in their homes. Again, as with Neopets, the models were significantly lower quality than those shown in the trailer.</p>

<p>Finally, the Battledome section of the alpha was released on the 16th of September. This had reimagined the battledome to be something more akin to a basic Pokemon battle rather than the complex mechanics of the Neopets.com battledome. In fact, aside from the Neopets models, there was absolutely no resemblence to any gameplay from the original.</p>

<p><strong>Paid Promotions</strong></p>

<p>Although Neopets Metaverse had for a long time been incentivising retweeting and liking their content on their Twitter accounts via giveaways, on September 14th 2022 this stepped up to another level. The company partnered Glow Labs, a company that allows users to earn cryptocurrency by replying to, liking, and retweeting content posted by Neopets Metaverse.</p>

<p>This level of paid promotion obviously boosts the profile of Neopets Metaverse. It also, in many places, constitutes advertising as an influencer - something that is regulated and requires users to directly post that they are performing paid advertising for the product. Neopets Metaverse does not request or require that users do this, seemingly wishing to deceive bystanders into thinking the engagement is organic.</p>

<p>At the same time, Neopets Metaverse began reaching out to their Twitter followers privately over direct message to try and engage them in influencer work that would be paid via NFTs or merch. Again, at no point did they request that those who they contacted made clear they were advertising for the game in a paid capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Alpha+ and the Winter Alpha</strong></p>

<p>Neopets Metaverse initially planned to use the 2022 Neopets Birthday on November 15th as the launch date for their currency tokens, but continued downturns in the crypto economy and a bottoming out of the Solana currency specifically due to heavy exposure to crypto exchange collapses meant that plan was delayed.</p>

<p>Instead, Neopets Metaverse released an updated 'Alpha+', a small iteration of the original Alpha that was originally unplanned. Much of the feedback from the original Alpha had been either ignored or overlooked.</p>

<p>Following this, Neopets Metaverse announced an additional 'winter' Alpha build would be released shortly before Christmas 2022. This would release the Terror Mountain world to their game. In the lead up to the release, Neopets Metaverse held a version of the Neopets Advent Calendar as a limited number giveaway. Entry was via answering incredibly simple trvia questions like knowing the name of Terror Mountain or a Neopet species. Many of the days offered sponsor prizes, and in a few cases new examples of merch - again dispatched by Neopets.com and its partners rather than Neopets Metaverse.</p>

<p>The Winter Alpha eventually released on December 20th 2022. Terror Mountain, it transpired that it was largely devoid of actual content. Despite collapsing all three Neopets.com maps for Terror Mountain into one, only two links were clickable - both of which were redirects to the Neopia Central Neohome and Games Room links.</p>

<p>More substantially, this update launched the game's quest and crafting systems. Quests, despite being marketed as the vehicle through which the game's storyline would progress, turned out to be generic challenges like 'log in for X days' or 'play X games' found in any modern free to play game. They were hosted by the Money Tree, in a departure for the character. Crafting, meanwhile, was largely devoid of substance, including ingredient items rendered in a non-Neopets realistic 3D style and copy pasted, poor quality names and descriptions. Such was the poor quality of the writing in the Winter Alpha that the Neopets Metaverse team felt the need to proactively apologise for it prior to opening feedback, blaming localisation difficulties. As a reminder, Neopets Metaverse is a project developed and marketed primarily to the US audience. It should not have any localisation issues as it is not <em>being</em> localised.</p>

<p>The update also included two new winter themed games. The first was a 'port' of the Neopets.com game Snowball Fight that had been previously requested by the Neopets Metaverse community. However, gameplay had been altered to essentially be a clone of Ultimate Bullseye, making the game unrecognisable compared to the original.</p>

<p>The second game was original to Neopets Metaverse, titled Icy Islands. It was a very basic version of gameplay comparable to Maths Nightmare hosted by a Uni - a new species added to the Alpha for the winter version.</p>

<p>Feedback to the Winter Alpha, even among project loyalists, was negative. Yet, Neopets Metaverse started a competition offering additional merch (a calendar) for posting positive feedback on social media, obfuscating the actual reception it got. Additionally, it appeared that the previous efforts to recruit influencers to play and promote the game kicked into overdrive, with social media users who had never before interacted with either Neopets Metaverse or Neopets.com content suddenly becoming massive fans of the project.</p>

<p><strong>The Polygon Move</strong></p>

<p>Despite being initially very publicly pro-Solana, the blockchain the NFTs were sold on, continued crashes in the price of Solana made the prospects of actually running a profitable game using the blockchain on the scale Neopets Metaverse would need quite remote. As such, Neopets Metaverse began to seek out alternative blockchains.</p>

<p>As their luck would have it, the blockchain Polygon was at the same time looking to poach projects from Solana to improve the look of their own blockchain, and was offering grants to projects that were willing to swap. Neopets Metaverse bit their hands off.</p>

<p>On the 19th of January, 2023, Neopets Metaverse announced their <i>third</i> known round of funding. They had secured an additional 4 million USD of capital to cover the fact that, one year later, the project had yet to make any substantial profit. The funding was provided by three blockchain venture capital funds, Netdragon itself, and Polygon via their conversion grant.</p>

<p>It wasn't until the 20th of March, 2023, that Neopets Metaverse actually announced this migration, swapping the Solana NFTs 1:1 for new versions on Polygon, starting on March 23rd, 2023. FAQs promoting the swap claimed that Polygon was a more suitable blockchain after all, citing many of the same reasons that the project had originally claimed they selected Solana for a year previously. Absolutely no mention of the funds was made as a reason. Pro-Solana users took the team to task over this in an AMA following the announcement, suggesting there were more reasons for the change than those listed. To be clear, there is only <i>one</i> reason for the swap. Polygon paid them to do it.</p>

<p>At the same time, Neopets Metaverse updated their website, making good use of their 4 million USD in funding to make cartoon portraits of all staff members for their about us page. Jim Czulewicz, Jumpstart CEO, and Anthony Conely, freelance artist working for Jumpstart originally known as old TNT member Tiger Catcher, were removed from the listing. This was seemingly to enforce the idea that Neopets Metaverse is now spun off into an entirely different company, despite the clear evidence it is not. Dominic Law, previously the head of the project known as the Chief Metaverse Officer, was promoted to Chief Executive Officer (CEO).</p>

<p>Oddly, updates to the Terms and Conditions of the website made at the same time included provisions seemingly intended to insulate it from anti-crypto legislation in countries around the world. Specifically, the terms stated that the game and anything related was not being made available in countries like China, Russia, Canada, and most hilarious of all, <i>the United States of America</i>. Given that the game will rely on Americans for any measure of success, this seems like it was included as legalese rather than something they intend to act upon, but the broad wording of the T&amp;C means that an American *even viewing the page the T&amp;C is on* is breaching it. Neopets Metaverse have yet to comment on this.</p>

<p><strong>Cancellation</strong></p>

<p>On July 17th, 2023, Neopets announced that it was under new ownership. Dominic Law, the previous CEO of Neopets Metaverse, had secured a management buyout of the brand, establishing it as an independant entity. This included a refocusing of many brand elements and most notably Neopets Metaverse would be cancelled.</p>

<p>As the NFTs exist on the blockchain and cannot be removed, they remain in place. However the game surrounding them is no longer in development. Assets from the game are slated to be reworked into a new app known as World of Neopia that will not have crypto elements.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the announcement included details that there was $4 million in funding for the new Neopets. This is suspiciously close to the $4 million funding round Neopets Metaverse secured and it is possible it is the same money. If that is the case, several crypto investment companies now remain invested in Neopets and it is possible new crypto avenues may be explored as a result. However, for *now*, it appears that crypto and Neopets is done.</p>
