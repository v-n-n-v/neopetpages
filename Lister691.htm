Questions</b></font></a>
<hr><b>How were points worked out?</b><br>
We don't know exactly, but we do know the following:<br>
- The faster you did everything, the more points you got.<br>
- No points were given out for moving sand<br>
- No points were given out for moving blocks<br>
- No points were given out for moving furniture<br>
- No points were given out for completing the Qasalan Hieroglyph Click Sequence 

(Fake)<br>
- No points were given out for speaking the "Fake" Second Prophecy and getting the 

Mountain of Scarabs!<br>
- No points were given out for fighting in the Battledome (except as part of the 

puzzle)
<hr><b>I didn't get a trophy!</b><br>
If you completed any part of the puzzle you will get a trophy. Go to the <a>Gift Shop of 1,000 

Rewards</a> to activate it.
<hr><b>How do I get the sidebar?</b><br>
If you completed any part of the puzzle you will get the sidebar. Go to the <a>Gift Shop of 1,000 

Rewards</a> to unlock it, and then go to the User Preferences page under 'Help' in 

the sidebar to turn it on.
<hr><b>Where do I get my prizes? Which prizes should I get?</b><br>
Get your prizes from the <a>Gift Shop of 1,000 

Rewards</a>. I can't tell you which prizes to get, its your choice.
<hr><b>Where did the temple go? Where did the repository go? Where did the fortune 

teller go?</b><br>
The puzzle is now over. You can no longer complete any of the steps.
<hr><b>What happened to the Parchment Puzzler avatar</b><br>
I asked a programmer the very same thing. Here is the reply I got.<br><img src="http://i31.photobucket.com/albums/c361/Jibbles95163/dirtside.gif"><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/ldp_parchment.gif"><hr><b>Where was the war?</b><br>
There was never going to be a war. Donna said in the editorial months ago that 

there wouldn't be one, just some fights instead. You got those.
<hr><b>What is the next plot, and will there be a war?</b><br>
Probably the Darkest Faerie, and yes, there will probably be a war. Don't quote me 

on that though, I can't tell you for definate.
<hr><b>Will you be doing a guide to the next plot?</b><br>
I'm not sure yet... probably.
<hr><b>What will happen to this page now?</b><br>
It will remain here as a historical archive.
<hr><b>Who is behind Lister691?</b><br>
I am! <a href="//www.neopets.com/randomfriend.phtml?user=jibbles691">Jibbles691</a> is my username. No, thats right, Lister is not a 

person, Lister is a pet. For those who care, Lister is named after a character 

from the fabulous Red Dwarf tv show.
<hr><b>Can I put my Useless Crystal or Mysterious Scroll in my Safety Deposit Box?

</b><br>
Yes! There was a bug that meant you couldn't, but you can now! I recommend it, you 

wouldn't want the pant devil or grundo leader to steal it!
<hr><b>My crystal/scroll has disappeared!</b><br>
Now that the plot is over, you can't get another one. Sorry!
<hr><b>Where did you get the "LDP - But What Does It Mean?" avatar from?</b><br>
You could get this avatar from completing and translating your mysterious tablet. 

As the plot is now over, this is no longer possible.<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/ldp_tablet.gif"><hr><b>What happened to the transcripts?</b><br>
Sorry, I've stopped doing them.
<hr><b>Do you work for TNT?</b><br>
No, although I wish I did. I'm just someone with far too much time on their hands 

lol.
<hr><b>Is it true the KIKO'S are planning to overthrow TNT? (as asked by mleckie)

<hr><b>10th June - Editorial</b><br><i>When will the next war start .... You know after the maraquan war finishes 

which war will be next?</i><br>
Haha.. give us a chance :) I am not sure right now, it is too early to say when. 

It will be set in the Lost Desert though.
<hr><b>17th June - Editorial</b><br><i>Could you maybe combine the supporter and warrior role into one?</i><br>
Hmm... That is interesting. Maybe this is something we would do in the next war. 

Also, to change things up a little you will not be given the option to choose 

sides in the next war, you will all unite and fight together!
<hr><b>24th June - Editorial</b><br><i>Can you show the cast of the Lost Desert plot?</i><br>
Some of the cast will be spotlighted on the Card of the Day page, but we are not 

going to release their pictures just yet. I can tell you however that the stars 

are as follows :<br>

* Prince Jazan - Male Kyrii<br>
* Princess Amira - Female Aisha<br>
* Horace - Male Blumaroo<br>
* Nabile - Female Ixi<br>
* Tomos - Male Lupe <br><br>
Not an Usul in sight :D
<hr><b>24th June - Editorial</b><br><i>Could you please make Sakhmet City an actual city?</i><br>
Oh it will be soon enough :) The Lost Desert will be majorly revamped when we are 

running that storyline. 
<hr><b>1st July - Editorial</b><br><i>Are Princess Vyssa and co. still in charge of Sakhmet?</i><br>
Not as such, no. This is a whole new plot set several years later. Vyssa has left 

her sister Amira to run the city while she is off on royal visits and such. (Plus 

we have had way too many Usul heroes and heroines).
<hr><b>22nd July - Editorial</b><br><i>Why are there never any Shoyru heros in the plots?</i><br>
Oh, that's because we hate Shoyrus (only joking). Actually Princess Amira's most 

trusted advisor in the Lost Desert plot is a Shoyru.
<hr><b>26th August</b><br>
Lost Desert Plot Update - The first installment of our new storyline set in the 

Lost Desert is due to go live next week. You will start to see these strange 

scrolls around the site. Maybe you should think about holding on to them...<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/lds_scroll_set.gif" width="80" height="80" border="0"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/lds_scroll_ben.gif" width="80" height="80" border="0"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/lds_scroll_nem.gif" width="80" height="80" border="0"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/lds_scroll_djo.gif" width="80" height="80" border="0"><hr><b>26th August - Editorial</b><br>
Wow, thats a lot of questions. Firstly the first part of the plot (the first 

comic) will go live next week. You will be able to see every part of the story as 

they go live, the same way they last two plots worked.<br>
The scrolls are part of something special we are doing with this plot. Basically 

rather than just having a war to decide who gets what, there will be many puzzles, 

many fights and some other challenges for you to do in order to earn points. The 

scrolls may be used in that, just as a hint, if you see one, hold on to it. I 

can't tell you more than that as I have already given away a lot :) Just keep 

checking new features. 
<hr><b>30th August</b><br>
Part one of our Lost Desert story has just been launched. In this episode we 

introduce you to the main characters and set the scene. Click <a>here.</a><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/frontpage/ldp_1a_siu3084j.gif"><hr><b>1st September - Lenny Conundrum</b><br>
This weeks Lenny conundrum offered the chance to win Pyramid Painting Vol. 7: Faux 

Finishes... interestingly the scroll doesn't seem to be one of the 12 we had 

found.<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/lds_scroll_etc.gif"><hr><b>2nd September</b><br>
The second part of our story set in the Lost Desert has just been released, to 

find out what happens, click <a>here</a>.<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/frontpage/ldp_2b_n3021nls.gif"><hr><b>2nd September - Editorial</b><br><i>I wondered, if you could set up a link somewhere to the Lost Desert Plot 

anywhere, so that we don't have to search through the news, to read the comic?

</i><br>
There should be a link from the Lost Desert map page, if there is no already, 

there will be one shortly.<br><br><i>In the first part of the new Lost Desert plot, why on earth is the strange 

visitor riding a Uni?</i><br>
The Uni is Jazan's best friend. They often go on adventures together and they can 

travel far faster with Jazan on his back. Unfortunately Kyrii are not known for 

their remarkable running speed. <br><br><i>Donna, I have seen some people have Tyrannian army points, Will you be having a 

Lost Desert army in this plot and if so, how will you get the points?</i><br>
This plot we are doing something different, you will not be able to choose sides, 

but you will earn points that can be redeemed for great prizes. One way will be 

through fighting, but that is just one of many...<br><br><i>Please tell us if you will be having a Neoboard about the Lost Desert plot?

</i><br>
Yup, we missed it the first day we launched the plot, guess we were too excited 

getting the comic finished. The Neoboard is now there, so you can chat about it 

all you like :)<br><br><i>Why in plots are Uni's nameless steeds who never talk?</i><br>
Oh this one is very different :) This Uni has real character as you will see later 

on :D<br><br><i>How come the Ixi on the comic has hands instead of hooves?</i><br>
That is Nabile, she is a special character from our TCG set. As with a lot of our 

named characters we use a little artistic license with their appearance (like Isca 

and Caylis). It would be difficult for Nabile to do some of the things that she 

does later in the story if she only had hooves.<br><br><i>I was wondering if you were going to update the Sakhmet Palace featuring the 

Lost Desert Plot characters?</i><br>
Yes, in fact the whole Lost Desert map will be changing quite drastically very 

soon. Muahahahahaha! <br><br><i>I was just wondering about the Lost desert Plot. I don't really understand what 

we are suppose to do. Could you explain?</i><br>
For now just have fun playing games and enjoy the story. You will be asked to play 

a more active role as the story unfolds.<br><br><i>Fortune Teller? Mysterious Tablet? What is this all about?!?!</i><br>
o.0 I have no idea what you are talking about...<br><hr><b>7nd September</b><br>

Part five of our Lost Desert plot has been released and things are not looking too 

rosy for Princess Amira and her city. Click <a>here</a> to find out what 

happened...<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/frontpage/ldp_5a_cjwh3912.gif"><hr><b>16th September - Editorial</b><br><i>Just wondering if the Lost Desert Plot will be super-ultra-extra hard to solve? 

And could you tell us a little insight on what will the main solving quality be? 

(i.e. battle,puzzles)</i><br>
We are hoping it will be super-ultra-extra hard to solve. Its hard to make a 

puzzle with millions of people working to solve it though, I am sure some people 

will get certain parts easily. The parts really are quite varied, and you just 

need to figure out what you have to do to progress.
<hr><b>22th September</b><br>
Chapter 6 of the <a>Lost Desert 

Plot</a> has just gone live. It seems things are getting worse in Sakhmet.<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/frontpage/ldp_6a_b81hdla3.gif"><p>
Those curious about the Nightsteed will be happy to hear the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=57">Neopedia</a> now has a 

bit more information regarding this mysterious character.
</p><p>
Eep! It appears one of the creatures attacking Sakhmet has gone too far. Can you 

help the <a>Defenders of 

Neopia</a> defeat this monster?<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/frontpage/qasalan_defenders_2005.gif"></p><hr><b>22th September - Lenny Conundrum</b><br><i>It starts in the desert but not in the plain,<br>
But then? Not in sunshine, but found in the rain.<br>
After that, just ask Coltzan, Amira knows not.<br>
And end in the pyramid; not a temple or hut.<br>
Put them together, your next task's in hand.<br>
And perhaps a great city will return to this land.</i><br><hr><b>23rd September - Editorial</b><br><i>I have found the 2nd paper that shows which door I have to enter. I've looked 

in the temple for more then a week. I cant find it. Can you please do something 

about that? Im really anoyed!</i><br>
If you find yourself becoming lost in the Temple of 1,000 Tombs, we suggest you 

begin to map each area of the tomb starting from the first room. It's much easier 

than randomly clicking away and becoming lost or running around in circles. But 

you didn't hear it from us as we don't give hints to plot puzzles. *shifty 

eyes*<p>
<i>I've mapped the entirety of my Lost Desert temple, but I'm missing several 

door-and-symbol combinations - including the one I need for the first piece of the 

tablet. Is this a glitch, or is there a way to unlock all of the temple?</i><br>
Everyone's tomb contains each door/symbol/colour combination that currently 

exists. Try going back and looking through your map carefully to make sure you 

didn't miss any rooms. (This message contains no clues or hints whatsoever.) </p><p>
<i>Are you going to release a sidebar with the Lost Desert Plot?</i><br>
Erm… sidebar? What gave you that idea? Yes, we are hoping to! It's still in the 

works though, so no promises as of yet, but it is our intention to release one if 

we can. Shhh…</p><p>
<i>How can younger players participate in the lost desert plot? We can't play 

[insert game we can't name lest we give away puzzle clues by accident]! Is there 

an alternative way?</i><br>
Yeah, sorry about that. That location was chosen for the plot before it had been 

removed from the site for those users. We've since modified the page to give the 

proper clues in a slightly different manner so if you're one of those users that's 

stuck, just return to that page to get the next clue.

He is a rather feisty little fellow with that cudgel of his, isn't he? Perhaps 

after the plot we can work on that so you can have your revenge. Or! Even better!

<i>Are there going to be parts where it's advantageous to be amongst the first to

We're trying. :) Anyway, without giving too much away, we'll say that we are 

keeping track of every piece of the puzzle each person completes. There are 

certain stages where completing things first will earn you more points than 

someone who completed it much later, but in general, the more of the puzzle you 

complete as a whole, the greater the reward will be at the end.

see the entrance, but I get sent to that room immediately. Did I do something 

wrong? Or is it a fault in the game?</i><br>

Not to worry! Every time you completed even the smallest step during the puzzle, 

it was logged and tracked. It doesn't matter that you don't have the scroll at 

this very moment. We know you completed it and can even tell when, what order, 

what you did before that, etc.. That's kinda creepy actually.

Anyway, this is also the reason why it will take us a while to tally points,

<b>Thank you spending so much time to figure out what everyone did for the LDP. 

The wait was long but it now seems worth the wait to me. I wanted to send out my 

thanks because I am sure a lot of hours were put into figuring out the points for 

every person who took part in the plot. Of course I would have liked more points 

to spend on things but as far as war/plot prizes go I felt this was the most fair 

way I have seen them done since I have started to participate in the wartime/plot 

activities. Again My heartfelt thanks for a puzzle plot and individualized plot 

points! ;)</b><br>
What's that strange noise? Is it... praise?!? It's so warm and fuzzy!! Thank you! 

^_^ We do really apologise for the wait, but we wanted to check and re-check 

everything quite a few times to make sure it was as fair as possible! (Not to 

mention making sure the prizes themselves were just right. Anubis Toxicology 

Reports, anyone?) We can't really express how happy we are that everyone enjoyed 

themselves! It was a LOT of work, but we hope to make the next plot even better. 
</p><p>
<b>How long will the shop for the lost desert plot prizes be open? I want to wait 

a while, but I didn't want to come back in a few weeks to see that all my points 

had disappeared.</b><br>
Though there are always unforeseen events, at the moment we have no intention of 

ever taking it down so feel free to take your time in choosing your well-deserved 

rewards. :) 
</p><p>
<b>I didn't get anything (trophy nor points) and i did at least a third of the 

plot... I even still have the pictures I saved from making a map so i could get 

around my tomb better so I was just wondering if there was any specific reason I 

didn't get anything. Thank you.</b><br>
As a general note to everyone, you need to go to the Gift Shop of 1,000 Rewards to 

pick up your plot points, trophy, and sidebar. If you have done this, are logged 

into the same account on which you participated in the puzzle, and you are 

absolutely positive you participated (and didn't just wander around your temple 

and leave) and still don't see a score, please feel free to contact us and we will 

check our records. 
</p><p>
<b>May i know how did TNT calculate the scores for the plot? I have completed all 

the puzzles but have less points compared to others who have not done so. Why is 

this so?</b><br>
Well, we won't give away all the secrets. ;) However, we can say that the faster 

you completed portions of the puzzle, the more points you got. We wanted to make 

sure that anyone who was brave enough to map their temple and trudge their way 

through the Scroll Repository was properly rewarded, but those that were with us 

the whole way and figured things out before anyone else got more points for their 

extra effort.
</p><p>
<b>I am very proud! I got the maximum amount of points on the Lost Desert Plot! 

And I love my prizes! So I feel pretty bad complaining, but I noticed that I don't 

have the ultimate trophy... Simply because I skipped the false prophecy. I'm glad 

to see that it wasn't worth any points, but I'm really disappointed to have a not

-quite-as-spiffy trophy because I skipped the unnecessary step. Do you have any 

comfort for me on that? Thanks!</b><br>
Congratulations on completing the plot! We hate to be the one to tell you this 

though... 179,300 is not the top score. The trophy you possess is the second rank 

down though, which isn't too shabby. :) As stated in an earlier question, some 

people who finished faster than you were given more points. The top scorers were 

revealed on the New Features for February 1st if you'd like to see how you 

compare! 
<br>
And it should be noted that whether or not you completed the false prophecy had 

nothing to do with your final score or trophy! No points were awarded for 

completing these two parts of the puzzle, since it was fake and all that. It was 

just a fun thing to list in the stats. :)

no you couldn't just go and work together on this one :(<br>
On the 11th September, the fortune teller started recieving visions in her crystal 

ball. One appeared approximately every 6 hours, and these were clues to finding 

the missing pieces of the tablet.</b></p><p>
<b>Once the tablet was complete, the fortune teller started saying:<br></b>
<i>You've found all the tablet pieces! Remarkable!" The fortune teller gazes into 

her crystal ball for a moment. "But what does it mean? These glyphs and their 

order mean nothing to me. I'm a fortune teller, not a professor of ancient 

languages! We must find some way to translate them. You can look at the Mysterious 

Tablet again if you like.</i></p><p>
<b>You were then able to translate the prophecy (and gain an avatar in the 

process!). Once your tablet was translated, the fortune teller started 

saying:<br></b>
<i>So, the tablet has yielded its message. It sounds like some kind of... 

prophecy, I suppose. I wonder what the prophecy means.</i><br></p><p>
<b>You were then able to speak the prophecy to the fire faerie. section 5-3 for 

instructions on how to find this. Once you had done this, the fortune teller 

started saying:<br></b>
<i>You got buried in a pile of scarabs? How strange. I sure didn't see that one 

coming!" She glares at her crystal ball. "Piece of junk. That'll teach me to trust 

people at the Trading Post. Well, I guess you can still go back to the Mysterious 

Tablet. Maybe we can figure out something else.</i></p><p>
<b>On the 21st September the fortune teller also started to say:<br></b>
<i>She calls out to you again as you turn to leave. "Oh! I almost forgot. I heard 

something about a few of Princess Amira's ministers, who were outside of Sakhmet 

when it vanished. They're going to get that new scroll repository finished so that 

they can use it as a library, and try to figure out how to bring Sakhmet City 

back. I don't know when the project is starting, though.</i></p><p>
<b>Late on the 22nd September this changed slightly:<br></b>
<i>She calls out to you again as you turn to leave. "Oh! I almost forgot. A few of 

Princess Amira's ministers were outside the city when it... vanished. They're 

working on getting that scroll repository completed so that they can use it as a 

library, and try to figure out how to bring Sakhmet City back. I hear that the 

repository is way, way out in the middle of the lost desert.</i></p><p>
<b>On the 30th September this changed again:<br></b>
<i>She calls out to you again as you turn to leave. "That scroll repository 

they're building sure looks like it's gonna take a while. Sakhmet City is trapped 

in another dimension, plagued by zombies -- or so I hear -- and meanwhile, the 

remainder of Neopia quietly watches a handful of Rukis making furniture. 

Remarkable.</i></p><p>
<b>On the 31st October this changed again:<br></b>
<i>She calls out to you again as you turn to leave. "Oh, I heard that the scroll 

repository is now open for business. Just a bunch of scrolls, at first, can you 

believe that? How is anyone supposed to find anything? At least now they've put in 

a card catalog and signs on the rooms, so you know where you are!</i>

some extra benches, taking a break after all their hard work. The eldest Ruki sees 

you and waves. "Well, we're finally done with all the furniture! Even had some 

extras. Ah, but before you can put the furniture into the repository, the interior 

decorator is figuring out where everything goes. Putting down chalk outlines, so I 

hear." He leans back and sighs. "This oughta be the easy part!"

I'll be making lunch as soon as I get some supplies!
</p><p>
The chef, who looks very familiar, glances at you as you enter. "Well, fancy 

meeting you here. Turns out they needed a chef for the cafeteria here, and as I 

was out of a job, they hired me on!" He twirls his rolling pin. "Unfortunately, I 

ain't gotten any shipments of food yet, so I can't make anything. Just some 

mislabeled boxes." He sighs. "This job is boring."
</p><p>
The chef scratches his ear. "Say, I heard something about you surviving an attack 

by a pile of scarabs. Boy, adventuring sounds like a good time. But I've been too 

busy working to take a vacation. I sure would like a souvenir from one of those, 

you know, exotic locales." He shakes his head and swings his rolling pin around 

absently.
<br><br><br><br><b>Once you'd talked to him, you could go to the Gift Shop of 1000 Trinkets:</b>
</p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/desert/ldp/ldp_giftshop_int.gif"></p><p>
<b>Yeah... we have many exciting items.</b></p><p>
The bored gift shop owner looks at you with glum eyes. "I mean, we don't have any 

actual items right now. Business has been kind of slow. I'm not really sure why." 

She sighs.</p><p>
The gift shop owner perks up. "You know, there is one thing I have... but I 

couldn't just give it away. I'd do a trade, though. If you can bring me some black 

smoke, that would be really cool. Here, I'll even give you this little vial I had 

lying around. Let me know if you find some!"

don't really care. But thanks! Oh, here's the souvenir I said you could have." She

<hr><b>Once you had your useless crystal, you could go all the way up to the top floor

<b>Now as you can see, that didn't do anything. What you needed to do wass keep 

going back to the page every half hour or so. Eventually, you got a stream of 

light shining down from the crack in the ceiling. 
That is when you needed to put the crystal in.<br>

Once you had put the crystal in when the light is shining, little colours appeared 

on the wall.  Everyones colours appeared in different orders.</b><br><img src="http://www.jibbles.co.uk/ldp/KTcolours2.jpg" width="493" height="273"><br><br><br><a href="#TOC">Back to Table of Contents.</a>

<hr><b>Once you had your lights, you needed to overlay that information onto your 

Mysterious Tablet. There were 16 colours (including four blanks)... match them up 

in order with the symbol on your Mysterious Tablet. Now, if you clicked on the 

Useless Crystal in your inventory, on the enhanced picture you would see there 

were three coloured dots at the top - a red, a yellow and a blue.</b>
<p>
<img src="http://www.jibbles.co.uk/ldp/crystal.gif"></p><p>
Then you had to go to the card catalogues at the entrance and read the one that 

matches the first colour on your useless crystal (in my case red). Match it up 

with all of the symbols that are that colour on your mysterious tablet.
</p><p>
Then you had to go off and read those scrolls in the order they appear on the card 

catalogue. For instance, the first one I looked for was a red Djo (reeds) scroll 

in the Ruki Population Surveys area, and the second one I was looking for was the 

red trident scroll in The Stacks, Eastern Archives area. If one scroll appeared 

twice, you just had to read it twice. 
</p><p>
Once you had read all four of those, you had torepeat with the second colour, and 

then with the third. Once you had done all that, the last scroll you read was 

translated.
</p><p>
Your pet deciphers the scroll!

<hr><b>Thanks to kittishkatt for discovering this:</b><p>
You then went to the Temple of 1000 Tombs, and found a door that led to a spike 

trap. On the picture was be a clickable link, that was where you found the next

<img src="//images.neopets.com/desert/ldp/trap_spikes_uc_49863050ed.gif"></p><p>
After you had found the second crystal, you had to go back to the secret basement. 

If there was light, insert the new crystal.
</p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/desert/ldp/sol/map_room_4.gif"></p><p>
Then you had to down your new colours, and go back to the card catalogue.
</p><p>

</p><hr><a name="Section11-6"><font size="5"><b>6: Reading Scrolls - Take Two!

</b></font></a>
<hr><b>So now you had your second set of colours, you had to draw them onto your 

tablet like you did with the first set. Now you took out all of the reds, yellows 

and blues, and then you read the tablet backwards. To work out the colours, you 

looked at this chart:
</b><p>
</p><table border="2"><tr><td>
<b>Your Colour</b>
</td>
<td>
<b>You need to read</b>
</td>
</tr><tr><td>
Orange
</td>
<td>
Yellow, Red and Orange
</td>
</tr><tr><td>
Green
</td>
<td>
Yellow, Blue and Green
</td>
</tr><tr><td>
Purple
</td>
<td>
Red, Blue and Purple
</td>
</tr></table><p>
Now you just needed to work out which order to read them. Take a look at the card 

catalogues (they had changed!)
</p><p>
You read the reds, blues and yellows in the same order that the catalogues were. 

So, for my orange Lat symbol, I read a red scroll, then a yellow scroll, then 

finally an orange scroll.
</p><p>
Then you just need to work out <b>where</b> the scrolls were. For your red, blue 

and yellow scrolls, you just used the card catalogues like you did before. When 

you read the second of the two scrolls, you were be given a location. This was the 

location of the third (orange, green or purple) scroll.
</p><p>
So... once you'd read all three of the scrolls from that symbol, you moved onto 

the next symbol! Yes thats right, 24 scrolls in total!

<hr><b>This time, your light was exactly the same - so you didn't need to see it. 

First, you took all of the colours that you gained from the second crystal, and 

put them onto the tablet as before. So this time, you could ignore all the 

colours. So cross them all out. You were only interested in the blank spaces. You 

needed to read all of the scrolls (from left to right, top to bottom) for your 

blank symbols in order to get the location of the white scroll for that symbol.
</b><p>
For each of the blanks you had to read a matching blue, red AND yellow scroll. Now 

at the time, we thought it was random which order to read these in. It wasn't 

until the solution came out that we learnt the truth.
</p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/desert/ldp/sr/sr_chef_byr.gif"><br>
Apparently the chef got bored and started to paint his toenails. You were supposed 

to read the scrolls in the order that his toenails were painted, so in this case 

blue, yellow and then red. This revealed the location of the white scroll. Read a 

white scroll that matches your symbol. You could then move on to the next blank 

symbol (and the chef's toenails would have changed). However, it seems almost no-

one discovered this, and it was only a timesaver. It was perfectly possible to 

read the scrolls at random and move on.

<b>Now you had to take the scroll to the fortune teller!</b>

The fortune teller listens as you tell her the tale of finding the mystery scroll 

in the map room of the scroll repository. "Amazing! No wonder those architects 

were so tight-lipped about what they were building. Let met take a look at that 

scroll." You hand it to her. "Hmm... yes... I see... Ah ha! Of course! This is an 

ancient dialect of Sakhmetian, and I think I recognize it. I believe it says... 

well, there's a lot of nonsense up front, but finally is says, "The curse of Jazan 

will make Sakhmet disappear," which is an awful lot like that prophecy you found 

before. But then it continues: "Jazan must marry a true princess of Qasala to 

break the curse." That explains why he wanted to marry Amira, but... she's not a 

Qasalan princess. Is she?" The fortune teller looks confused. "I wonder how we'll 

pull that off." She hands the scroll back to you.

course! Stupid me, I was reading it backward. It was cleverly written to be 

readable both ways. Ah! See? In this orientation, it serves as... some kind of

The golden eye shines truth upon those who would do evil
</p><p>
<b>When you took your new prophecy to Nuria... you got quite a surprise!
</b></p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/desert/ldp/mountain_of_scarabs.gif"></p><p>
The second way (and the way you needed to do it in order to proceed) was to click 

the same symbols as the comic again, but this time in reverse order. Your tablet 

was translated yet again.
</p><p>

You've finally deciphered the true meaning of the tablet. It reads:<br>
The father of the prince will destroy the great desert
<b>
</b></p><p>
You then took the third and final prophecy to Nuria. After a lot of scrolling, you 

got to pick a weapon!
</p><p>
</p><table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="center"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/ldp_soed.gif" width="80" height="80" border="1"></td><td width="50"></td><td align="center"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/ldp_morf.gif" width="80" height="80" border="1"></td><td width="50"></td><td align="center"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/ldp_soiw.gif" width="80" height="80" border="1"></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><b>Scimitar of Eternal Dawn</b></td><td width="50"></td><td align="center"><b>Mace of Righteous Flame</b></td><td width="50"></td><td align="center"><b>Spear of Infinite Wisdom</b></td></tr></table><p>

You could pick any, they were all the same. The weapon broke when you took it, but 

it didn't matter. You could still use the broken weapon.
</p><p>
</p><table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="center"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/ldp_dawn.gif" width="80" height="80" border="1"></td>

		<td align="center"><b>Spear of Infinite Wisdom</b></td>
	</tr></table><p>
Now it was time to defeat Razul! You could fight him once with the weapon, and it 

would reduce him to 0 hp. Once you had done that, you could not fight Razul again.
</p><p>
That was the final step to the puzzle!
