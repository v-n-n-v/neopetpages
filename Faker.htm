<h4 style="border-radius: 20px;">character synopsis</h4>
Raiden, a sleazy conman, ran from trouble he earned, and accidentally ended up in a backhole desert town. Thinking to lay low, he forged his way into seemingly easy employment at a failing post office. Things get more complicated as he starts gaining extra coin as a black market parcel deliverer, the town sheriff begins eyeing his shirked postman duties, and a dark desert beast stalks his service line.

<h1>Calling Card</h1>
<h2>An 1800s custom of the upper class to signify social status with heavily embellished selfie cards;
ornamentaion was expensive and implied higher and wealthier status; precursor to the business card</h2>
<p>
Raiden stuck his head in through the inn door to spot around, and then strode in with confidence. There had been a smaller tavern on the strip, but it hadn't looked nearly as likely to house wealthy clientele, and he had a certain reputation to begin here. That would be his primary goal for the first few weeks. Establish that he was a man of might and influence. Then trust, and thus currency, could be garnered. "Inkeep!" he called, as the door swung shut behind him. "Innkeep, a room, would you kindly?" he impatiently shouted towards the back. Then he took a rigid, upright stance several paces inside. For all anyone could tell, he was the very picture of a prim gentleman.
</p>
<p>
A gruff man came through a side door and examined the sand scoured apparel and worn boots of his possible new patron with severe skepticism. He wiped his hands free of flour with a damp cloth as he judged the state of this traveler. Evidently he did not like what he saw, and made some quick asşumptions. "Get out, stranger. We have no food to spare for those passing by while we have children and neighbors to providence." His arm gestured wide towards the street.
</p>
<p>Raiden had affected a pleasant smile when the man entered, but a true moment of shock shone through as he quickly grasped the insinuation. Evidently folk in these so called parts had a better eye for the value of a soul. It would take more work to convince this town than he usually encountered from the desperates of genteel clasş, so ready to pay for cures, and so egotistical to believe they could never be fooled by common folk. "Ah, you have me mistaken! I am Raiden Atrophy, a merchant for Rose Petal Liniment Co. and journeyman practitioner. Perhaps you have heard of myself and my prestigious business newly moved to town?" He tugged a silk scarf from his vest pocket, and retrieved a carefully protected card.
</p>
<p>
Though the illustrated parchment shows signs of wear at the edges, oil stains from too many fingers, and a smudge of dust, it indeed proved upon any thorough examination a certain trustworthy high quality, ornamented as it was with great swaths of elegant calligraphy and sophisticated gold filigree. Everything about this calling card declared that this must be a successful voyager merchant.
</p>
<br><div class="border"><br><br><br><br><center><b><font size="5" style="">RAIDEN ATROPHY</font></b>
<h5>Artificer of Extract Healthfull Solutions</h5>
<i>For the cures of rheumy humours<br>
Or waste of poor breath and body<br><b>Drink Away Bile With Full Health</b></i>
<h5>Patents courtesy Rose Petal Liniment Co.</h5></center><br><br></div>
<br><br><p>
The inkeep tugged on the tip of his beard, and as he read his brows raised. A lingering scowl turned into the faintest trace of a smirk just before he replied, "Around these parts we lack the well manners to give a care for such sophistication," he said with a serious, placid tone.
</p><p>
Raiden feigned to be taken aback, his hand clutching his chest in exaggeration. "My, why, I have never encountered such a lifestyle! May it prove interesting. I was right to take the company business outreach to settle in this admirable town. I only regret that in my transport across your deserts I was taken unawares and came into a rough state of dress. My trunk of usual garments were lost in an unfortunate sandstorm, and now it seems as if my spare travel clothes depict me with disfavor." His eyes flickered briefly towards the desk. "You do take gold coin, no?" he added, as if it were an afterthought.
</p><p>
Upon taking the stranger's coin, the innkeep examined it thoroughly, while Raiden waited with an affable expréssion, then led his new guest up the stairs to a high end suite. Before he unlocked the room, he turned back to Raiden with a conspiratorial lean forward. "Does your guild know about that scandal a few towns over? Some lawless snake oil salesman of ill repute was proved to be nothing more than a charlatan. He had no license and no name given!" He looked sympathetic to Raiden's plight in having his guild accused and the mess it brought to honest merchants like himself.
</p><p>
Raiden took on a face equal parts sour and apologetic, then nodded his head slow with gravity as he agreed, "Yes, my dear friend, our guild members have been notified to look out for such a scoundrel and report him for the notable reward on his head. Do let me know if there is any news of him the guild has not yet gathered? I will of course leave part of such reward with you! Tis the honor of a proper merchant which concerns us, and restoring our reputation is reward enough for me." He waited for the innkeep to nod back sagely.</p>
<p>After the man explained the schedule of the house and the lovely amenities available, he left Raiden to settle down to his peaceful slumber. Instead, after he had thrown himself fully clothed atop the delicate bedspread, Raiden lay awake, staring into the dark. News had traveled across the deserts far more quickly than he anticipated if his exploits had reached even this barren, rundown backhole. Apparently it was time to seek out hiring for a new occupation.

<h5>Charismatic - Cowardly - Shameless</h5><br>

Responsibility ain't his thing. Never wants to be needed or to make commitments. Not a particularly good person, but quite glib enough to convince most people otherwise. He's not afraid to pursue what he wants, and delights in not having to work for it. In other words, he's a sleazeball with no life direction. Plus, behind the mask he uses for manipulation, he's also a Jerky McJerkface.

<br>
Doesn't like high society other than to infiltrate it and make off with mementos of wealth. Doesn't care for gold for its aesthetic value or social power, just loves the easy life that throwing currency around can bring. Prefers slumming it and living casually. Lives for the thrill. Stirs up drama for funsies. Hobbies include writing, bullying small children, turning a profit out of nothing, getting in and out of trouble, and collecting skeletons for his closet- both the ones of bones and the ones of secrets. Gave up caring years ago, and spends his time wasting as much time as he can.

Raiden contemptuously lifted his jacket off his shoulders a bit with his finger tips, gave it a shake, and dropped it down in a gesture of confidence. "I never steal. I got morals," he refuted with his original vernacular slipping in, before he returned to his refined accent. "Some folk just lack a proper appreciation for my fine wares and are quick to wrongly disparage. That is the real sham." He held by his claim of innocence with his chin upraised righteously.<br><br><div class="border"><h5> Why you always running in place?

Long, wide scarf of thin fabric. Used to keep the sand out of his shirt, and to cover his head from the hot sun. Loose, lightweight longcoat with huge pockets. Leather chaps to prevent chafing. Thigh fitting leather boots to keep the sand out. Respectable dress shirt and high waisted pants held in place with suspenders. Keeps water canteen clipped to pants. Always has a messenger bag, stuffed with items for sale, items stolen, items for survival, and mail. Occasionally carries a second bag if there's not enough room in his own for letters or packages.

<p>Nymph,
</p><p>
In the time which I have known you, I came to feel emotions I never have before, nor ever desired to experience. Shame. Responsibility. Hope. These foreign objects crowd in my throat until I choke on my lies. At these times my mind is burdened with such a deluge of moments with you.

</p><p>
You pester me in these such ways to drive me from my own awareness. Your interference has cost me dearly in my exchanges and excursions. Consider this a letter of hate mail. For I do hate you, yet, more so, I hate the thought of not having you in my life. Do what you will, beast. My tolerance for your distraction is to be seen. I am not sorry, nor a changed man, for I doubt fate would ever accost me so and sway my ways.
</p><p>
Now I am writing this to you because I know you shall never be able to read it. After all, to you, these are but strange markings, and thus these words will never reach your heart. Unless, one day, I am able to meet you eye to eye and deliver them to you.
</p><p>
You are the greatest nemesis I have ever gone against.

<h2>Why Faker is a beloved permanent pet with emotional meaning to Nobody.</h2>

<h3>IT ALL STARTED WITH A MUTANT LENNY NAMED RIDE</h3><br><p>
Ride the Mutant Lenny went up for adoption in 2009. Before him, I had no interest in words as names. All my pets prior were named after characters from my favorite literature, such as Song of Ice and Fire. Back then, I'd never understood why anyone would want a word for a character's name. Also, I had especially always, and still to this day, disliked short names. There was no reason at all for me to fall for Ride, and yet I did. For whatever reason, I had this clear idea of a mean spirited vulture from the wild west, a character I gave the obscure, at the time, name of Raiden Atrophy. It's possible that my attraction to Ride stemmed subconsciously from my childhood love of ACDC, because, of course, the themesong I used for his page was the track Ride On.

</p>
<p>
<strong><i>."It's another lonely evening and another lonely town. Ain't too young to admit it, and I'm not too old to lie. But I know what I'm gonna do. I'm going to ride on. Got myself a one way ticket going the wrong way. Gonna change my evil ways one of these days. Till then, I'll just keep dragging on, riding on and on and on. And I ain't too old to hurry, cause I ain't too old to die. But I sure am hard to beat. But I'm lonely. What am I going to do? Ride on." - </i>ACDC</strong>

</p>
<p>
 I created him to be a slimeball of a man, someone who'd take the gullible for what coin they were worth and ride off into the sunset. My tagline for my application was the quote, "A crisis is an opportunity riding the dangerous wind." I pictured this vulture character with his huge wings outstretched, floating through the high air, coasting over the desert, riding the winds. I was fixated to the point of obsession. I thought about him every day, I drew him during my classes, I wrote poetry for him, I created a comic series starring him, and I worked on my application every night for weeks before I submitted it with hope in my throat. In January 2010, the adoption process came to a close, and he found a permanent home with my friend. 

</p>
<p>
<strong><i>."That inner feeling, no sugar coating that. It'll knock you down, flat on your back. It hurts to lose something you once had had. But take a good look around at all the good things you still have. Cause there will be another. There will be another one. Something new to fall into. It will be a better one." -</i>Bronze Radio Return</strong>

</p>
<p>
 I took a few months hiatus from Neopets after that, while I dealt with that senseless grief that comes from losing your chance to own the pet for this character you spent weeks creating in your application. When I returned, I appreciated the pets I had, and took solace in my love for them, but I had, even during those months, been unable to stop thinking about Raiden. I'd continued to doodle him, and I'd even spent a few weeks  turning the comics I'd made into an interactive website so the comic pages were animated. I didn't have a pet for this character, but I continued to love him, as if my undying fascination with him would one day bring him into being, if only I could find a different pet that worked for his character.

</p>
<p>
 Life went on, as it does. I graduated college, found new life friendships, completed an internship, started working and teaching art classes, acted for a theatre, got into parkour and swordplay, joined administration and staff for several conventions, met my biological brother, created a comic series for publication, lost my love, became disabled, and everything else that has happened in the last ten years of my life. Through all of that, I never stopped playing Neopets. It was a constancy in my life, a consistent source of comfort and inspiration. The remnant bond I felt to Ride in my application submitted in January 2010 created my interest in English words, and that entire decade was spent congregating words with conceptual evocation to inspire an entire roster of my beloved characters. At first they were misspellings I created, such as Comeday, Trageday, Direwolfe, Timelorde, Scarekro. When I was chosen to adopt Appalling in July 2011, however, I became determined to fill my accounts with correctly spelled words. I was successful, and joyously curated the arrangements of my pets, beginning to form patterns, such as my account of English words nine letters long ending in -ing.

</p>
<h3>A NAME GAME</h3><br><p>
 In April 2019, a neofriend who needed a pet slot shoved Adopter in my virtual face and made me adopt her. I was delighted. Because of her, I started collecting English words seven letters long ending in -er. I managed to acquire three more, including Growler. In November 2019, we received a sixth pet slot, and my hunger for another matching pet was again stoked. I sought one more for my set. In December 2019, my plans for a full 7L -er RW themed account were thrown off when I came across Miser up for trade, a name which fit perfectly for my character inspired by the band Malice Mizer. I absolutely had to trade for him, but at that point I didn't know where to slot Miser, since this 5L -er RW stuck out against my tidy collection of 7L -er RW pets. Then, in June 2020, Faker went up for trade. Another  5L -er RW pet to bring balance to Miser. Even more than that, his name, this specific word, meant so much to me already.

</p>
<p>
 Faker is the ingame name of a professional player in a game called League of Legends. I've played Leagues every week, sometimes daily, since 2012. It's meant a lot to me and to my loved ones. I'm not great, but I'd like to get much better, and I aspire to  garner skiIIs like the pros I see in webstreams or spotlit on television. The pro Faker is arguably the most mechanically skiIIed player ever, who is legendary for his mental resilience and physical endurance when gaming, who has won innumerable tournaments and competitions, and is the only player to have won eight titles. Faker is a legend to everyone across the entire Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game genre. He is known as the best player of all time. And there I was at this thread at eight o'clock in the morning on June 4, 2020, just staring at the knowledge that this was my chance to own Faker. A joke to throw at my friends whenever whimsy took me. To exceed someone's skiII and win in a competitive setting is known as, in slang terms, to 'own' someone. If I owned the neopet named Faker, I could then joke to my friends, "I own faker."

</p>
<p>
 I knew I'd never live it down if I didn't immediately swipe this pet off the neopound chat and sink my claws into him so deep that I'd never let him go. I knew that since he had just entered the market he would quickly become of interest to others. I knew I had very little time to find something the owner would like. I threw every pet I had up for trade, whether RW, MS, or CW, and even some pets I had created to keep. I ran over to my chatspace with my neofriends and cried out about what I had encountered and what could be done to synch my offers.  I didn't want to Jinx myself, but I declared that his existence in my life was necessary. My neofriend Royal was willing to offer on my behalf. The owner liked Royal's pet Sorcirer, so I traded my pet Thirsting to Royal for Sorcirer, then traded Sorcirer for Faker. By noon that same day he was mine. Mine mine MINE! MWAHAHAHA!

</p>

<h3>SENTIMENTALITY</h3><br><p>
 It wasn't until several weeks later, while I was staring at this precious abomination that had zapped from a Zombie Blumaroo into a Maraquan Lenny, that I paused. Lenny. The awkward bird Neopet with terrible anatomy. Lenny. For some reason, this was something I deeply desired. Yet it didn't make sense. Why would I want an ugly bird pet? At first I didn't know where this feeling stemmed from. The feeling persisted, tugging at my thoughts for the rest of the day. The nostalgia and desire were so strong, but I remained bewildered. Then I realized. Mutant Lenny. Ride. Raiden! Raiden, my conman! Faker? Faker, a word meaning fraud, charlatan, deceiver, swindler! Like Raiden! My vulture! After all this time of wishing, after a decade of this character wandering the edge of my mind, could this finally be my Raiden? Faker the Mutant Lenny!

</p>
<p>
 By this Twisted Fate, I coincidentally ended up in the possession of a five letter English word ending in -er with a meaning that perfectly described a character I had created ten years and six months prior of the same species this pet zapped. For all these reasons, I knew I had stumbled my way into owning a permanent pet that I became attached to since the second I saw him. For all these reasons, he has the nostalgia of my younger days and my obsession over his character, and I have the sentimental dopamine loaded response while staring at him on my account. For all these reasons, I love Faker.

</p>
<p>
 I like this character because he's a loser. I've always had the bad habit of being attracted to those. You could say it's a soft spot I developed from coping with my own feelings of inadequacy and repeated failures, which caused me to relate to insecure and troublesome individuals, and enjoy watching others either go through the process of personal growth, or wallow in self inflicted misery. I love inflating the egos of losers so they burn themselves through insecurity and become overcompensatingly egotistical. I love seeing them crash and burn again. This may be a bit of cruelty to my own nature, but losers have always fascinated me. In an August 2016 journal entry, I wrote<strong><i>, "Losers are people who do not try because they believe they have already lost. Winners are people who make the attempt and go beyond their own expectation. Attempt to fulfill your hopes and believe in your dreams. I am a loser who could become a winner." F</i></strong>ailure doesn't make you a loser. Giving up on your own life is what makes you a loser.

</p>
<p>
 So, I deeply relate to Raiden. I know his despair over being unwanted and abused by his family. I understand how he cared so much that he gave up on caring about anything. I know why he stopped trying, why he stopped hoping, why he gave up on all his dreams and became a wanderer with no intent other than enjoying the moment. He's afraid to dream again. I was, too, for a long time. I'm still fighting in that battle against the unwanted life companion named Trauma. I chose to fight because my need to reach my stars is so much stronger than even my fervent plea to avoid further pain. Raiden, however, long ago passed by that crossroad. He truly believes he already lost long ago and that his life has no point. He refuses to let himself have purpose or feel comforted. He's afraid of anyone who would make him feel cared for and then abandoned. He won't even try. Yes, that is the kind of person that I have that soft spot for, that urge to both protect and destroy. This is a character I intend to gleefully send through hell before he may have his redemption.

</p>
<p>
 A faker is a loser wearing a mask. Raiden puts on this guise of a reputable merchant and good civilian so he can con the unwary, when really he's a disgusting snake oil salesman. The secret is that this is only a second persona hiding his true character. There is a boy behind the heavy veils, waiting for some trace of hope, still crying because his existence didn't meet expectations. By the end of his adventures, my darling Faker will face himself, his past, and his life choices, and grow from a twisted manchild into something somewhat resembling an adult. He'll stop thinking of himself as a loser, stop faking his way through life, and finally, after twenty long years of self destruction, allow himself to be happy. And I think that's precious.

</p>



<h3>INFLUENCES</h3><br><p>
It amazes me that the name or look of a virtual pet can inspire an entire character and its entire world. Then, in turn, these characters I make from my pets inspire me to create all forms of art. I end up writing, sculpting, drawing, animating, coding, creating things pulled from my heart and memories relating to my Neopet muse. I sometimes even end up singing aloud songs I wrote and composed for my characters as I do household chores.
</p>
<p>
I've put myself in this character. I've given him my fear of failure, my fear to trust, my fear to be happy. I've put into him all my hatred towards bullies, and all my pain from being bullied. He has some of my mannerisms, and a hoard of personality traits in others that disgust and annoy me. Although as a character I carefully crafted I do adore Raiden, I would actually truly despise him if I were to meet him in person. It's hard to look at someone disturbing who is close enough to you, who has a past like yours, that you are a mirror, and notice how wretched you could have turned out. It's hard to stare at a warped reflection. Usually, when we go to put a little something of ourselves into a character, we tend to use positive or neutral bits. With villain characters, however, we have to dig around at places in ourselves we'd rather hide, and see that reflection we don't want to face. It was actually somewhat therepeutic for me to use my negative life experiences and fears to form a character. Unlike my own, or so I feel, I can control his fate. Raiden may have been partially inspired by my own life, but he has an entirely different approach to his own.
