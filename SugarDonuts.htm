<a name="intro"></a><h2>welcome!</h2>
<p>hi!  I'm <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=akuroy_of_the_moon">zeki</a> and welcome to my character creation guide.  I'm a writer and illustrator and I take great pride in my character designs and development.  for now, they're top secret non-neopet personal projects of mine, so I can't show them off here... but I hope I can still help using my 14 years experience in character creating.</p>

<p>this guide can be used by anyone, whether you don't have a character yet and are looking to make one from scratch, or have a character but need to develop them more.  in fact, whether your character needs some development or is pretty fleshed-out, remember this: no one is ever finished developing a character.  there's always plenty that could be added or changed.  when you think about it, most characters out there have a ways to go before they're as complex as you or I.</p>

<p>in this guide, I tell you what you need to know about your character in order for you to create your own.  I've listed some common personality traits, separated by positive, negative, and neutral, that you can choose from.  I've also provided some questions for you to answer as your character.  if you're an artist, there's a section about what impact different colors can have and how to choose them for the right impact.  okay, let's get started!</p>

<a name="name"></a><h2>choosing a name</h2>
<p>when I was younger, I used to give my characters the randomest names ever without regard to their personality (sometimes).  now I try to have a connection between name and either their personality, their character as a whole, or their role in the story.  giving characters random names can be okay, because then it's more like reality; parents name their children without knowing what they're going to be like when they grow up.  sometimes it's just plain unfitting once you find out the meaning of the name, that is if it's a real name with a meaning.  a REALLY unfitting name for the purpose of irony can be great, like my scary zombie dragonfish character named Cuddles.</p>
<p>making up your own unique name usually means it'll automatically fit your character because they both come from your vision.  for my fantasy creatures, I tend to use a lot of real words that mean something in some language, or names from mythology.  for normal human characters, I choose real names that I like.</p>
<p>you can choose a name at any time.  sometimes you might start with a name you like and build a character out of it.  sometimes you have the character all designed and it takes a month to think of a name that suits them.  that's okay because names are important.  don't settle on a name you think is "just okay" and wait for it to grow on you.  then you'll have a hard time changing it later if you find something better.</p>
<p>for name ideas, try...<br>
-<strong>name origin websites</strong>: behind the name, 20000 names, etc.  you can look for names by meaning and country of origin so you can find what fits your character.  a lot are from mythology as well.<br>
-<strong>baby name websites</strong>: find realistic names here.  also check <a href="//www.neopets.com/~pokol">this list</a>.<br>
-<strong>school yearbooks, phonebooks, etc</strong>: get some first and last name ideas from these.<br>
-<strong>name generators</strong>: look up seventh sanctum, as recommended by <a href="//www.neopets.com/~HollyhockGod">lynx's writing guide</a>.</p>

<a name="pers"></a><h2>Personality</h2>
<p><strong>the four temperaments</strong> can be a great starting point.  pick one of those if you're unsure and build from there!  you might have a character idea in mind already; they should fit into one of these (theoretically fundamental) personality types (paraphrased from wikipedia):</p>
<p><strong>sanguine</strong>: enthusiastic, active, sociable, outgoing, charismatic, extroverted<br><strong>choleric</strong>: independent, decisive, goal-oriented, ambitious, logical, leader-like, extroverted<br><strong>melancholic</strong>: anaIytical, detail-oriented, empathetic, methodical, thoughtful, reserved, introverted<br><strong>phlegmatic</strong>: relaxed, peaceful, quiet, easy-going, sympathetic, introverted</p>

<p>now that you've decided on one of those (I hope), take a look at my trait list I put together over the years.  I tried not to list more than one synonym per meaning so there aren't multiple words with too similar of meanings.  I like to select around 10-12 per character, which gives me enough without having too many that become redundant.  it may seem like a high number when you're starting from scratch, but you'll get there.  main characters need at least 10 while supporting characters can have around 8+.</p>

<p>for every positive quality you give a character, give them a negative one to balance it out.  too many positive qualities can lead to a bland, unrealistic character that no one can relate to.  it's okay to have too many negative traits because it gives the character room to improve (plus it can be funny).  neutral qualities are neither good nor bad.  mix up your character with all three types of qualities!</p>

<p>+<b>positive qualities</b>: friendly, patient, careful, honest, generous, playful, alert, calm, neat, gentle, kind, brave, proper, polite, noble, charismatic, confident, witty, moral, funny, energetic, caring, optimistic, loyal, protective, cunning/sly, innocent, cooperative, prudent, compassionate, affectionate, sympathetic, tolerant, astute/shrewd, cheery, angelic, peaceful, curious/inquisitive, determined, independent, ambitious, diligent, persistent, innovative, creative, assertive</p>

<p>+<b>negative qualities</b>: vain, cruel, aggressive, belligerent, evil, naïve, malevolent, immoral, greedy, sarcastic, selfish, rude, arrogant, sadistic, lazy, mean, hot-tempered, antisocial, messy, insensitive, pessimistic, dishonest, irritable, insecure, careless, paranoid, aloof, cold/unfeeling, snide, harsh, spiteful, vicious/violent, reckless, defiant, mischievous, manipulative, devious, psychopathic, sociopathic, uptight, distrustful, vindictive, picky, scatterbrained, pushy, coarse/vulgar, rebellious, insecure, cowardly, snobbish</p>

<p>+<b>neutral qualities</b>: serious, modest, quiet, outgoing, reclusive, relaxed, romantic, quirky, shy, childish, nerdy, timid, stoic/emotionless, mysterious, silly, excitable, daring, introverted, extroverted, casual, bold, gloomy, mild-mannered, adventurous, talkative, dominant, submissive, docile, carefree, hyper, nervous, impulsive/spontaneous, lonely, emotional, logical, instinctive, competitive, stubborn, indifferent/passive, secretive, methodical, introspective, sensitive, sassy</p>
<p>
<strong>tips</strong><br>
-main characters should have the same number of positive traits as negative ones (or as close as you can to it).  you can be a <i>little</i> more lenient with your supporting cast, but not by much!<br>
-people like a character much more when they can relate to/identify with them, a.k.a. saying "he's a lot like me," or "aw, I'm a loner too," or "I feel that..."  people need to care about your character if you want them to care about what happens to them in your story.  they need to have faults like human beings (whether they are one or not), so give them traits that readers can relate to.<br>
-<i>never</i> base your character off of a stereotype.  double-check or ask for other people's opinions to make sure you haven't done this by accident.<br>
-look at your cast of characters as a whole: they need to be distinguishable from one another.  take a line of dialogue, preferably a shorter one, and have each of your characters say it in their own way.  if you change <i>who</i> says it, would the line stay the same?  if you can change around who says what and no dialogue sounds out-of-character, then the characters are obviously too similar.<br>
-don't just tell the audience that your character is/has a certain trait.  the audience should know it by looking at them or by reading their dialogue/actions.<br>
-if your character has a backstory, make sure it affects the plot and their development/arc somehow.<br>
-sometimes the villains are too cliché.  they're evil because they want to be evil.  their motivation... is to be evil.  try writing a villain who could be mistaken for the protagonist if your story hadn't already introduced one.  the villain's motive could be the right one from <i>their</i> point of view; they believe <i>they're</i> the protagonist.<br>
-every character has to want something out of life (or your story).  what is their motive, and what motivates them?  for every action they perform, why did they do it?<br>
-by the end of your story, it's best if at least one of your characters has changed or developed.  no matter how they change, they must be a stronger (or more well-developed) character as a result.<br>
-this one's obvious for the main character(s), but supporting characters need to impact the plot too.  if their inclusion doesn't affect or change anything, why were they included?
</p>

<h3>the difference between introverts and extroverts</h3>
<p>(from wikipedia)<br>
-extroverts are <i>action</i>-oriented, while introverts are <i>thought</i>-oriented.<br>
-extroverts recharge and get their energy from spending time with <i>people</i>, while introverts recharge and get their energy from spending time <i>alone</i>.<br>
-extroverts often prefer more <i>frequent</i> interaction, while introverts prefer more <i>substantial</i> interaction.<br>
-extroverts seek <i>breadth</i> of knowledge and influence, while introverts seek <i>depth</i> of knowledge and influence.</p>
<p><strong>my notes</strong><br>
-contrary to popular belief, it is possible to be an introvert and NOT be shy and/or quiet.  shyness can be a negative trait or even a personality disorder associated with conceitedness.  why?  when someone is shy, it's because they're worried about how another person will perceive them.  they're afraid to talk to others because they're afraid of how they will look to the other person.  being a quiet person does NOT automatically make them shy.</p>

<a name="char"></a><h2>Characteristics</h2>
<p>you have to know everything about your character!  here are some things to think about, for starters.  copy and paste it into some word processor or notepad and then fill it out for each of your characters:</p>
<p>name: <br>
nickname, if any: <br>
species: <br>
gender: <br>
age: <br>
birthday: <br>
birthplace: <br>
ethnicity/nationality: <br>
positive personality traits: (see list above)<br>
negative personality traits: <br>
neutral personality traits: <br>
favorite foods/drinks: <br>
intelligence level: <br>
hobbies: <br>
skiIIs: <br>
powers, if any: <br>
how they interact with others: <br>
prized possession(s): <br>
what their voice sounds like: <br>
dialect (i.e. american english, scottish english, etc): <br>
accent, if they have one (only if they know another language i.e. german accent, romanian accent etc): <br>
self-confidence level: <br>
self-control level: <br>
patience level: <br>
etiquette level: <br>
emotional vulnerabilities: <br>
psychological oddities (do they obsess over things, etc): <br>
mental/psychiatric disorders/disabilities, if any (PTSD, anxiety, insomnia, some kind of personality disorder, learning disability, etc): <br>
fears/phobias: <br>
secrets: <br>
desires: <br>
habits: <br>
introvert or extrovert? <br>
optimist or pessimist? <br>
dominant or submissive? <br>
emotional or logical? <br>
spontaneous/instinctual or structured? <br>
strengths and weaknesses: </p>
<p>
one of my favorite things to do, because it can get so varied and tell a lot about a character, is making a list of their likes and dislikes; however I go a little further and make it their loves + likes + dislikes + hates.</p>
<p>
loves: <br>
likes: <br>
dislikes: <br>
hates: </p>
<p>I totaled the average number of each from my main character biographies and this is what I got.  15 loves, 9 likes, 4 dislikes, and 5 hates.  try to aim for around those numbers, and don't worry if that seems a bit high of a goal for now.  those are my most well-developed characters and they've been in the making for years.  when I first create a character, they won't even have 3 things <i>total</i>. XD you might already know what your character likes and dislikes, but it's just a matter of separating them into the extremes or coming up with more.</p>
<p>against my better judgment, here's an example from my main character's bio.  no stealing!<br><strong>loves</strong>: acting, filmmaking and cinematography, anything funny, all kinds of movies, 1930-1940s comedy, pretty desserts and candy, frozen desserts, cartoons, toys, stuffed animals, making people laugh, jokes and puns (even bad ones), unintentionally funny movies, dancing, music<br><strong>likes</strong>: snow, catching snowflakes on his tongue, reptiles, white skies/cloudy days, cheesy popcorn<br><strong>dislikes</strong>: smart alecks, rudely sarcastic humor, overly serious people who can't take a joke, offending people<br><strong>hates</strong>: rude people, intolerance and discrimination, blue humor, profanity, narrowmindedness</p>
<p>so as you can see, I tend to list a lot of things the character loves, because we all love lots of different things; possibly more than things we don't.  "likes" are things they just... like, and not as strongly as things they love.  same kinda thing for dislikes (and usually I can't think of TOO many worth noting), whereas their "hates" list must be reserved for only the strongest of hated things.</p>
<p>side note: look how much you've learned from my character just from his likes and dislikes!  you can tell that he's a child-at-heart actor, movie buff, and comedian... who lives in a cold place.</p>

<a name="appear"></a><h2>Appearance</h2>

balanced or clumsy? <br>
strong/muscular or weak/scrawny? <br>
lazy or active? <br>
swift or sluggish? <br>
graceful or awkward? <br>
meek or intimidating? </p>

<a name="colors"></a><h2>Color Scheme</h2>
<p>this mostly goes for artists (deciding on a very specific color scheme anyway), but writers too should have an idea of their character's hair color, eye color, skin/fur/feathers/scales and everything else that needs its color described in the narration to differentiate that character from others.  if you've decided on their favorite color, they may wear it more than other colors.</p>
<p>you can find ideas for color schemes just about anywhere on neopets.  look at backgrounds or existing characters for inspiration.  I like to copy and paste the picture into MS Paint and colordrop the defining colors.  they should be used as ideas only; you should never directly steal the exact color scheme (I mean you could if the creator has stated that it's for free use and you don't mind your character possibly having the same color scheme as someone else's :P).  some petpages list color palettes, such as:<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~adellaey">Kleur</a><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~_Elementary#schemes">Elementary</a><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Eyrie98_2#extras">Pascal</a><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~kenaze">Wild Breeze</a><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~amoremedai#colors">Magnet</a><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~solidarized#palette">The Lunch Box</a><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Dulche#pal">A La Carte</a><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Gastohn">Block Font Colors</a><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~kozi#two">8-Bit Fonts</a></p>
<p>here are some of my favorite color schemes I've made.  please credit me and link back to my page if you use them in a layout, but if used for a character, I ask that you don't copy them exactly if you can help it and no credit is needed.</p><p>

<h3>the psychology of color</h3>
<p>the color(s) you choose for your character will have a psychological effect on your audience.  it's good to select colors based on what personality, emotion, or mood you want that character to convey to the viewer.  you don't HAVE to do that of course, but you might be surprised how powerful this technique can be when used well.  after all, it'd be odd, or at least unexpected, to have a character with colors such as vibrant yellow and hot pink be a villain, wouldn't it?  dark colors are usually attributed to villains and anti-heroes, but I feel like heroes/protagonists (and antagonists who aren't evil villains) can pull off any color scheme.</p>
<p>I've listed some colors and what kind of character each one is best for (well, since that's relative, you could also say... what kind of character each color typically reminds us of).</p>
<p>~still under construction~</p>

<a name="tests"></a><h2>Questionnaires</h2>
here are some tests/forms to fill out through your character's eyes.  if your character is relatively new and still underdeveloped, you might leave some answers blank or give a generic response.  that's perfectly normal; characters grow over time.  new ideas for their personalities will pop out at you from all over soon enough.

<h3>personality questions</h3>
<p>I wrote these questions myself with inspiration from a few other tests.  make up some of your own questions and add them too!</p>

2. what do they like and dislike about themselves, appearance-wise?<br>
3. what do they like and dislike about themselves, personality-wise?<br>
4. what do others (family, friends, partners, strangers) like and dislike about them?<br>

<h3>yes/no test</h3>
<p>I found this test online a loooong time ago from some psychology website and forgot the name... well I wouldn't be able to link to it here anyway.  so... here you go!  now become your character.  pretend you're an actor if you aren't already and transform!  you now think like they do and react to things the way they would.  when you think any thoughts, their voice and dialect is now in your head.  got it?  read the following statements and decide whether you agree or disagree with them.  if you're not sure, you now know what you need to work on!</p>

<p>there are a ton more character development forms like this out there that you can search for and fill out!  for example there's the well-known myers-briggs test; search for it online and take it as your character.</p>

<a name="other"></a><h2>other ways to develop characters</h2>
<p>+<b>play simulation games</b> that allow you to create a customized character and base it off of yours.  The Sims, Tomodachi Life, etc can all give you ideas.  to give some examples, two of my characters became best friends because it happened in Tomodachi Life and I thought they looked good as BFFs.  another of my characters now likes making ice cream sodas and other fountain drinks because he picked up the mixologist skiII in The Sims and I decided it fit him.</p>
<p>+<b>write stories with them</b>.  it doesn't even have to be a narrative like you'd find in a novel; sometimes an idea for a random scene pops into my head and I write it in the form of a script.  yep, a script with mostly dialogue and limited descriptions.  I believe dialogue is one of the most important things in defining a character and screenwriting helps you focus on that.  if you don't feel like writing novel-style, any actions they might perform while speaking can be described briefly and succinctly in the screenwriting style.  here's an example I wrote (character names have been changed to my neopet names):<br><strong>Mahliaa</strong>: I can shapeshift myself and others, including inanimate objects. I can bend reality too, to some degree.<br><strong>Cabaret</strong>: Oh, wow! That sounds really useful! You can become anything... and turn others into anything? (he sees Zaroshii watching and doesn't want him to feel left out) Hey, Zaroshii, what are your powers? <br><strong>Zaroshii</strong>: (a little surprised) Oh, uh... I... can glow in the dark... (looks embarrassed) ...I haven't discovered all of my powers yet. (thinking) <i>...What would everyone say if they found out I'm actually a human and Mahliaa transformed me...?</i><br>
in screenwriting and comic scripts, all of the character's thoughts and feelings have to be incorporated into their dialogue/thoughts.  think about a comic; it has no narration, so the only way to tell what the character is feeling is to pick it up through their dialogue and body language.  the narration (in parentheses) should only show actions and not feelings, except when it describes the way a line is spoken or the characters' facial express!ons and body language.</p>
<p>+<b>roleplaying with friends' characters</b> can help with development a lot and give you new ideas.  roleplaying is creating a story between (usually two) writers by having one person write a paragraph and then the next person writes the next paragaph to continue the story, and so on.  you need to know how your character would react to the given situation and interact with the other's character(s).  RPing is easiest when you're using a character you know inside and out, but I've also used a character that had no development at all to try and get him some.</p>
<p>+this may sound silly but <b>find a song</b> whose singer you think could be the voice of your character.  when you listen to the singer, imagine it's your character.  I do that for all of my characters and I've gotten a lot out of it.  take one of my characters for example.  I had his voice pictured clearly in my mind and then soon after, I discovered the band Abney Park; their singer sounds EXAAACTLYYY how I imagined my character's voice! xD picturing my character singing while listening has given me clear imagery of his mannerisms and even a few personality details inspired by some of their lyrics.  plus it's fun. 8D</p>
<p>+a writer's best friend is the phrase <b>what if...?</b>  if you're stuck for ideas (and this goes for story writing too), say "what if" [insert some character idea or unexpected situation here] and see where it could go.<br>
-character development samples:<br><i>what if...</i><br>
...your character is a fanatic of a band or TV show that everyone else makes fun of.  do they hide their extreme devotion or scream it to the world?<br>
...your character is secretly a secret agent... secretly.<br>
...your character is afraid of something they shouldn't be afraid of, such as a marine biologist afraid of fish.<br>
-story idea samples:<br><i>what if...</i><br>
...your character has a sudden change of heart.<br>
...an earthquake or other natural disaster strikes.<br>
...your character's friend suddenly calls them with some interesting news.<br>
those are just some quick ideas.  think up some of your own!</p>
