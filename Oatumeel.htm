				<h2>How do I search for stuck pets?</h2>
				<p>Typically, you would find stuck pets through tilesetting. However, as of December, the "tileset" method no longer works due to broken images. TNT has stated in a ticket in January that their engineers are working on the issue. We do not officially know the cause of this problem. The resources listed below are based on the tileset method.<br><br>

</p>

<h2>How do I find stuck pets without the tileset method?</h2>
<p>http://neopets.com/~Dewyday
<br><br>
This is the current method being used as a workaround while pet images are not working. Feel free to ask in the board if you have further questions about this method.</p>

				<h2>What is a "stuck" pet? </h2>
				
				<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/ppp_ditrey.gif" class="wrapleft"><p>http://neopets.com/~Gretchu<br><br>A stuck pet is a pet with a name that will not show up by refreshing the pound like you would regularly. Pets in the pound are grouped together by the first two letters of their name (e.g. Brittaneighy and Brucey473 would both be BR-). For each string, only the first 3 pets alphabetically in the pound will be shown; all pets that come after will be stuck (so if you see Star123, Star1234, and Star123neo in the pound, every name beginning with ST from Star123neo0 to St__________________ will be stuck).The alphabetical order is: numbers (0-9), then letters (a-z), then underscores(_) (solarpoweredfrogs)

</p><h2> Will pets with certain names always be stuck? </h2>
Stuck pets can become unstuck, or visible in the pound, over time as the pets visible are adopted and it shifts the strings along. There are so many pets that it is unlikely that all of them will ever be unstuck unless TNT makes a change to the pound system. 
				<h2>What does "NS" mean? </h2>
				
				<p>NS means "Not Stuck". A pet that is not stuck is a pet that can be found through refreshing the pound page as you would normally.</p>
				
				<h2>How do I know what pets are stuck? </h2>
				
				<img src="http://imgur.com/Pxc8vY0.png" class="wrapright"><p> The opening posts on the board give all the current stuck strings as 3-letter strings. The first two letters correspond to the strings that have stuck pets, with the 3rd showing where along that stuck string we currently are. For example: if BIN- is a listed stuck string, we'll currently be seeing pets whose names begin with BIN- in the pound, all pets with names BIA- to BIM- are unstuck, and all pets with names BIO- BI_ are stuck. If their name does not match any prefixes - for example, any names starting with U through Z, then the pet will not get stuck and show up as normal in the pound.

	<h2>How do you find the age of a pet? </h2>
				
			<p>You look on their pet pages for their age in hours and put that into the SunnyNeo age calculator. If they are one of the pets that doesn't list their age on their petpage, you must adopt them to see it. Neopets was created in 1999 (Y1)

	<h2>Do you have X pet? </h2>
				
				<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/petpetpet_shuni.gif" class="wrapleft"><p> Probably not at the moment. We can only search for pets that are currently in the pound by name, not species/colour/age. If you can't find what you're looking for on the site or on the boards, then we probably haven't found any recently. Also keep in mind that certain species (Cybunnies, Chombies, Draiks), colours, WN pets, etc are seen as more desirable and are likely to be adopted as soon as they're posted. That said, if you hang around the board long enough you certainly have a chance to find what you're looking for! (solarpoweredfrogs)</p>

<h2>Do you take search request?</h2>
<p>Yes we do! However, please be patient with pet searchers as it can be a slow process at times. Keep in mind that all searchers do so because they choose too. It is entirely voluntary and they have no obligation to search requests if they so choose.

</p><h2>I transferred a pet to someone and they haven't accepted. What do I do?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, at this time you cannot cancel a transfer.
 After 48 hours of not being accepted, the pet will be defaulted back to your account and the transfer will be cancelled. In the mean time, you are trade-locked.
This means that you cannot make other trades/adoptions, ect. until the transfer is completed or cancelled.

</p><h2>What does 'Error: This Neopet is currently taking a vacation...' mean?</h2>
<p>This means that the pet is being transferred and has not yet been accepted.</p>

<h2> There is a pet that looks like Magma in the pound, but the color says red?</h2>
<p> This is a visual glitch. Magma pets turn red in the pound. You can however, transfer a magma pet. </p>

<h2>Why is there a pet in the pound with clothes on?</h2><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/ppp_fyropinch.gif" class="wrapright"><p>
If you see a basic pet with its clothes on (IE a Blue Bruce with a bow tie) it means that this pet has been in the pound for a very long time, prior to pets losing their clothes when pounded. There are several other pets with clothing that are glitches, such as the 'Maid Acara' that is actually a blue Uni.</p>
