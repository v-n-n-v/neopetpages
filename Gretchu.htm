<center><p> Ever wonder how the pound works? Maybe you wonder why you seem to get shown the same pets over and over when you refresh. Or maybe you pounded a pet a long time ago and he still hasn't been adopted, and when you refresh in the pound he never comes up. <br><br>Well, some very smart people (partially listed above) figured out that some pound pets get <b>stuck,</b> meaning they don't show up in the pound when you refresh. And the reason a pet will or won't get stuck has to do with the first 2 letters of its name. <br><br> Click the links above, because the Lost and Pound folks have a ton of information about how they figured out how stuck pets work, and how to search for them. If you want my detailed explanation about how stuck pets work, read below.</p>

<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/59_uni_techo.gif"><br><br><br>When you go to the pound, here's a page you might see. The pets tiggertimid, TiggerTrex, and tiggertron are all visible to you on this page in alphabetical order. When you refreshed, you randomly got shown this page in the pound that displays pets beginning with TI-. If you refresh again, you will randomly get the AA- page, or the AB- page, or the AC- page, or the GR- page, or the TI- page again, and so on (some of these pages will be blank- we'll get to that in a second). <br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/y4EumTt.png"><br><p><br>What you <b>don't</b> see on this lovely page of kougras is all the pets that start with TI- but come alphabetically <b>after</b> the ones that are visible to you. <b>These are the stuck pets.</b></p>
<br><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jtmX4cB.png"><br><br><br><b>So how do I adopt a stuck pet?</b><br>You must manually type its name into the pound search bar to view and adopt a stuck pet.

<br><br><p><b>What happens to the string if I adopt a regular, unstuck pet I see while pound surfing?</b><br>Using the example above: Once the pet, say "Smallish" is adopted, then "Smallz" will become unstuck and be visible in the pound next, since he is next in line alphabetically. The stuck strings are constantly moving as pets are getting adopted. <b>And once a pet's name becomes unstuck, it won't get stuck again.</b> This is why the stuck strings are always shrinking, and why some have disappeared entirely. If you adopt "Snowz" in the example above, then "Snubby" will become visible and we will say that the string has now moved from SNO- to SNU-. No more SNO- pets will get stuck when you pound them, rather they will be displayed first on the SN- page, like if you pounded an SNA- or SNE- pet.

<br><br><b>If I adopt a stuck pet, will it still be stuck if I pound it again?</b><br>If the string hasn't moved much, yes.

<br><br><b>What if the string has moved?</b><br>If you adopted Solocup while the string was only unstuck up to Soglam (as shown in the picture above), but gradually all the pets ahead of Solocup alphabetically got adopted so the string moved to be <b>after</b> his name, then his name is no longer considered a stuck name and he will appear in the regular pound if you pound him. Eventually, the whole So- string could become unstuck. This has happened with a lot of strings, which is why the L&amp;P keeps a list of strings that do stick, as opposed to ones that don't anymore.

<br><br><b>List of Stuck Strings</b><br>The Lost &amp; Pound staff maintains a regularly updated list of which alphabetical strings are "sticky", which can be found at the top of the Lost &amp; Pound board in the pound chat.
<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/pZ9jIl2.png"><br><br>However, it is important to know that these three letter string indicators are telling us where the string <b>starts to stick</b>, in other words, where the stuck meets the unstuck. So If you see that ANG- is a stuck string, that means that three ANG- pets are visible in the pound right now. They could be pretty early alphabetically, like Angel123, or they could already have moved so that Angry123 is visible. That is why we say that <b>some</b> ANG- pets are stuck, but we can say with greater confidence that all pets with the third letter alphabetically after ANG, so starting with ANH-, ANI-, ANJ-, through ANZ- and so on... are stuck! (But AO- pets would be the start of a new string.)


<br><br><b>Need another example?</b><br>Let's say SNO- is a stuck string. A pet named Snail123 will not stick and will be visible to pound surfers. A pet named Snuggles123 <b>will</b> stick, because it 1) is in the SN- string, and 2) the third letter makes it come alphabetically after SNO-. (thanks to ~Megablade for this explanation).
