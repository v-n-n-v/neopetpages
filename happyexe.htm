I never know what to write in these things, It's been years since I've even written a full 'story' on any site at all. For the sake of privacy I'm only going to go by my nickname, Yuu. So let me tell you a bit about myself: I'm a shoyru and I've recently moved to a small house in the countryside. Won't say where, but it's nice! It gets a bit lonely out here sometimes but I live.</div>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/NfKGTxf.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
The other day something odd happened, I noticed that I had one item on my wishlist on my Neoph. I have no idea when I put it on my WL; it was a free game and from what I saw had no in-app purchases. So whatever, but it looked cute and interesting and I decided to download it.</div>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ptPPVUt.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
I read the reviews while I downloaded it; Something about them seemed a little odd to me, the weird misspells and overly positive reviews. But there's plenty of things that could explain that, it's a small group of reviewers. I know they're real neopets because they had a lot of other reviews for similar games. So I brushed it off, but who knows, maybe yall think it's odd.<br><br>
Tonight I decided it was time to finally start the game, The game had a load section. There was no other saves so I just made a new one. The game started with a soft tune behind it; it was calming and kind of boppy. The main character immediately spoke as an 'enter your name' screen popped up.</div>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/1of68vh.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
<i>❝Nice to meet you, Yuu, I'm going to teach you the basics!❞</i> The character said, smiling brightly. They slowly brought me through the little <a href="#GUIDE">tutorial</a> before a small story explaining the story of the little poogle started up.</div>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/rKnV8UH.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
<div id="captions" style="border-radius: 15px;">
<i>In a small town next to Neopia Central...<br><b><font color="#fff">Misrow</font></b><br><br>
A young Grey Poogle sat quietly by the win<i></i>dow.<br>
They looked toward their neighbors;<br>Many of which were going about their day.<br>
Laughing and smiling.<br><br>
But something was wrong, they could feel it.<br>
Confirmed when the ground started to shake,<br>
A stagnant air filled the lungs of those around them,<br>
Watching in horror as everyone around them... stopped being HAPPY.<br><br>
They all became <font color="#9DA3FF">gloomy</font>, <font color="red">enraged</font>, <font color="#fff">different</font>.<br>
The Poogle had always been so caught up in their sadness,<br>
they had failed to see the beauty in the happiness around them.<br>
Now that it was gone - everything felt so wrong, so bad.<br><br>
What had done this? What had caused the badness to plague the town?<br>
They couldn't stand by and watch the town stay sad, or angry, or <font color="red">broken</font>.<br>
Their fur changed from a deep grey, to a beautiful, happy yellow!<br><br>
They were Happy now - and they have a job to do!</i>
</div><br>
I thought It was an interesting little story.

</div>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ipBEXvV.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
The game starts in the town from the story, it's an easy enough few levels, nothing to write home about. There's not much huge-plot details that matter for a while, just easy levels to get used to the game.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/i1JEQlT.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
As I reach the end of the Misrow levels, there's foreshadowing that the things Happy does in the town is a temporary fix because SOMETHING much bigger then this is infecting more of Neopia with the 'sadness' that he wants to fix. The last bit of the Misrow levels leads up to a boss fight<br><br></div>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/fBWd6xb.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
The boss was a juppie monster, honestly I forgot that those existed. I wonder if they're still around... Anyways, instead of beating the monster to death the goal is to make it smile or be happy- obviously because that's the whole point of the game. <br><br></div>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/2nqCLVf.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
It's cute, I kind of thought there was no real reason for me to write about this game while I've been playing it; it's just a game. Sure it seemingly popped up out of no where but after the first levels I thought I was wasting my time talking about it. Maybe I put it on my WL at some point and just forgot about it, honestly it's happened before. But something kept itching at my brain. Something about this little game made me want to keep writing. But what is there to write about when nothing is even Happening in the game? Do I want to show it off and get it more attention?<br><br></div>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/3niFGe9.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
I decided to keep playing. I've been playing the game for weeks at this point, It's easy enough to play while I'm waiting around town and it's keeping me busy when I am bored but don't want to do anything else at home. At some point I realized that maybe I should look it up on my computer, see if it's on other platforms or if the creator had a website. I even wanted to see if there was a little community held together by the reviewers in the store who seemed to love it.<br><br></div>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/VePmiLA.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
I tried for a long while to find any sign of this game. I probably re-typed the name of the game and anything that could get it to show up anywhere else 1,000 times. But there was nothing, nada, zip. That's when it really started to feel off. So many good reviews, but not a single person has talked about it anywhere? No one has ever reviewed it on a game website or maybe a forum? NOTHING? Even stranger, it wasn't on the PC version of the game store. It only seems to be findable- on my Neoph. There was something strange that had been biting at me since I started playing... And this really dug that in.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/5LxUiZl.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
I stayed up for hours after that, trying desperately to figure out anything. But no matter where I looked it just didn't work. But I wasn't going to give up, but I needed a new method. Honestly it took me too long to realize I could learn how to move the files from my Neoph onto my computer and search through them, but being nervous and not super... tech savvy. I had to do some research to make sure I didn't screw it up... So in the mean time, I played.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ympcccd.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
After that boss fight, it continued onto a map screen, showing bits of Neopia, the next level being the central.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gTdoYb8.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
I did go back to purchase some items though...<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/nwdn1XV.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
I started the new level, much like Misrow, it wasn't too different. Just the same mechanics with different things to happify. It was nearly identical besides being less tutorial heavy and with slightly 'stronger' saddies...<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/sg7eKnv.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
During one of the nights I was trying to figure out how moving files would be possible without messing the game up or something.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/9fTbsLZ.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
But I was interrupted- my phone chimed a little tune I'd never heard before, vibrating softly as a notification loudly alerted me. Usually I leave my phone on mute for notifications, so it honestly jumpscared me.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/lxsyuLi.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
When I walked over it had given me a notif to keep playing Smile. It was jarring to then realize that I had suddenly decide to lie down on my bed and Play. I had no memory of it. But I did feel a warmth from the missing memories. Maybe it was my ADHD, maybe I was just tired and my memory slipped... But it felt strange, for a good moment I couldn't stop staring up at my phone screen... <br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/AFEEqZA.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
A chill I've never felt fluttered through my bones. I had misplaced Three hours...<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/9JDmZW0.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
<i>Three hours...</i><br><br><br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QXbgecA.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
Maybe I overreacted a bit, I had decided to just stop playing due to that chilling idea that I missed an entire three hours- but maybe I had just been sleep deprived, nothing has happened in a few days. I went to the market today when I got another alert from the game, saying something about how I had missed several days. I decided to play my paranoia to the side and continue playing. Logically I probably spaced out while playing since I've been dealing with insomnia lately.<br><br></div>


<img src="http://i.imgur.com/pvkFjOP.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
I was greeted by this when I pressed play<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/WlkBQFV.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
It kind of felt... soothing. I feel kind of like a clown for overreacting. I played more of the game while I traveled back home.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/NRKqu6G.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
I managed to get to Kiko Lake, I wondered if they have a Kiko morphing potion design for Happy, so far I haven't found one, but I really want to see if they do. The kiko's are a mix of obstacles and saddy's, sometimes you can use their heads to hop up onto other parts of the level. That's kind of funny.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/9Whs6ys.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
While playing I did end up finding a Kiko morph for this level, which temporarily allowed him to float instead of hop on peoples heads. Cute!<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/jAGpPPq.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
For a while I was playing outside on my stairs a lot, Not sure why, it's not like these concrete stairs were comfy. One day while playing I was approached by someone.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/cyNDtbe.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
She was a tall pretty pink lutari, she was looking for her Puppyblew.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/0ido2UY.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
I offered to help look for it, which distracted me from my game.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/8iuMDmk.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
She was a bit shy, but agreed to let me help. I didn't have a petpet, haven't for years, but if I had lost mine I'd hope that someone would help. We started looking for it together.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/jJgOAQG.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
Luckily the petpet was found, we ended up finding it hanging out in a random mud puddle in the middle of an open field. We kept talking though, we ended up hanging out at her house for a bit afterwards. I'd made a new friend (finally) and it was neat. I don't want to take up all of this to talk about her only, but we ended up hanging out more and more afterwards, I'm talking a couple weeks. It really distracted me from the game, and also figuring out how the heck to put it on the computer to sniff through the files... I was just happy to make a new friend, I struggle with that stuff sometimes.<br><br></div>



<img src="http://i.imgur.com/jDWXaHR.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
One day at her house she noticed me playing it while waiting for her, I decided I'd tell her, I even told her about how I couldn't find any information about it online_ .. <br><br></div>


<img src="http://i.imgur.com/G0Hrl5q.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
We ended up spending most of the night talking about it, I explained that I wanted to look through the game files- but didn't really know how to do that. Just my luck, she told me she thinks she could figure it out for me.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/jA4nb1a.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
It took a few days to get it completed, she wanted to make sure not to corrupt my game, but we finally got to a point where we could safely copy the files over so I could look through them and still play the game on my phone. She even mentioned I could continue my progress through an emulator, but to be honest, the thought of figuring out how emulation works is a bit too much for me. I think I'll stick to just my phone.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/75236qQ.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
I'm excited to dig deeper into figuring out who made this game and the information on it. <br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/3OdnNlG.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
Of course the first thing we tried to do was open the folder that was obviously locked. It didn't work. <br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/AcZ2F0x.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
Both of us were excited to dig, expecting a lot more than we got, honestly. The other folders were your basic save_data, only mine was there. There was also some artwork and a large folder that had tons of levels inside of it, weirdly enough some of the levels were also restricted access. My friend really wanted to try and find a way to hack into that first restricted area, since we found nothing about an original owner. It shouldn't just been in the normal data folder- but it wasn't. Nothing was pointing us too a creator. I also want to point out, how it is a bit odd that the game is called "Smile", but the game-file itself is labeled 'Happy'. Maybe it changed in production? It was also strange to me that the App page, now that I think about it... Had put the 'author' as 'HappyEXE'. When phones don't use exe files, and why would that be the creator? I wasn't sure what it meant, but it was strange.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gs0GYre.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
Both of us were excited to dig, expecting a lot more than we She worked most of the night trying to hack into it and find ways around the block. I fell asleep at some point. She was confused because the regular hacks or admin tools just refused to work. Nothing was letting her in, she offered to come by whenever to try more. Which was no problem, we'd been spending a lot of time together anyways.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Y6Lx31S.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
I continued playing, she continued to try and break into that folder... time passed for a while, nothing really happening. Sometimes we just hung out completely normally, but I'd always find myself playing in between waiting for her. Or when she wasn't there, it kept me busy. It made my house feel less. Empty. I got to brightvale, I was getting better and better. Everything was still fine, just a cute game with a mysterious unknown creator.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/mnL0q4K.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
One night, she jokingly asked if she could try a level... I said yes, she'd watched me play sometimes, she knew the controls, she knew the main character. When my phone touched her hand, I felt a weird chill spin through my spine... I chalked it up to that feeling you get when you don't want someone to look through your phones gallery, I shook it off. She just wanted to play 1 level. And she did. It was going well.<br><br></div>

<div id="textwrap"> I fell asleep, which is apparently a problem of mine that I've never really noticed.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/XpRGwoG.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
She seemed nervous later when she told me how playing the level went, I hadn't seen any of it, but she told me she was on one of the Brightvale levels. She had happy-fied a few things and one of the lenny wizard saddy's.<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/clXo86f.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
In one of the castle towers there was a grey-droplet<br><br></div>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Wuky7HH.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
She apparently hadn't timed it right-running into  the droplet.
<br><br><div id="captions" style="border-radius: 15px;">
<i>
<font color="red">Oh No</font><br><br><br><font color="red">You made Happy Sad</font><br><br><font color="red">Why would Yuu do that? Yuu hasn't made them sad Once.</font><br>
Maybe it's because Yuu isn't the one playing.<br><br><br>
But how would I know.<br><br>
If that's the case.
Please do not play for someone elses save.<br>
If not, Maybe, Yuu needs to rest...<br><br>
This sadness wont be marked down this time.<br><br>Don't want to ruin your perfect streak this early!<br></i><center>=)</center></div>


</div><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SaAdFQf.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
When we reloaded the save, the droplet was gone. I don't really know what to say about this, I didn't see it but it shook her up a bit. I tried to help by saying maybe it was one of those things developers like to hide- a joke to call out you screwing up or something. But I don't think either of us really believed that... I think she's a bit mad that I don't entirely... Believe it was something to worry about? I don't know. I don't believe it was a malicious thing I guess, it's just a game, a weird game, but a game. After we relaxed she seemed okay though. I offered to let her make a different save but she wasn't interested. She said she'd rather keep to trying to hack into the files elsewhere.




<br><br></div>

<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lH9oKff.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
So we went back to the norm.


<br><br></div>

<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ylgi221.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
Finally one night she had succesfully gotten into the restricted folder. We were greeted with 4 items. A restricted code based item and a locked folder named 'saves' There were only 2 items that were open-able.


<br><br></div>

<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UYnLogs.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
One of them was some sort of stat info, but it wasn't the type you can decode without a computer due to the code-type. So it was just a bunch of random letters. From the 'stat' in the title she has decided it was most likely a code that kept a handle on "Happy's" stats.

The other one that is openable was the odd one though, it was an art program called "anipix." The program was one that had fallen out of use back in the early 2000's, not only is it outdated, but it's also very strange that it's hiding in the files of a video game. It featured different little animations that had been saved and exported for the game itself. + Concept sketches of various happy-morphs.
<br><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vUOg5js.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
while talking about how weird it was, we also spoke about how the 'Saves' folder is inside of the restricted folder. Normally that would be in the 'contents' and 'data' folders from the previous files, but we hadn't found that there. The contents had various animations or info on the other maps of the game. Data had other code-related things and whatever. But no saves. My friend said she originally thought there must not be a 'saves' folder until multiple saves have been created, or that it simply was impossible to actually find the save folder by just looking for the word Saves. But now that we've found it, that just makes it a bit weirder. Maybe a way to stop people from editing their saves? But if they wanted that couldn't they just use the codes that make it near impossible to edit without something to cr<i></i>ack the code?  Neither of us are quite sure... But she does want to try and get into the saves, especially because it won't effect my actual game... and also the 'px' file. Neither of us are quite sure the px actually stands for though. She'll have to keep trying to break into ANOTHER folder. I wish I knew more about stuff like that so I could help more.

I continue playing, my friend is at her home, we text back and forth during the game while she hacks. We were planning on hanging out today but the night was a bit too rainy, it's supposed to be a full on storm, so we had to post-pone our hangout. I'm sure her petpet is happy about the rain though. I do like the rain too... not the mud so much.

We played games after we talked about it for a while, but at some point the connection got pretty bad due to the storm so we went back to texting. She seemed fine the rest of the night.

AVA: Hello Happy! I've heard of your goal to spread cheer!
<br><br>


AVA: I've decided to offer some help!
<br><br>


AVA: If you give me happiness points instead of leveling up one of your moves
<br><br>


AVA: I can offer special items, and these items are exclusive to my t.v shop. They are also
<br><br>


AVA: permanent! So when you see my button, press!

I have no idea what ant paste is. Is that a real thing?<br><br><br>
I was super tempted to get the mystery box, but i went with the smile bag, mostly because I have a bad habit of hoarding every item I get and never using them because I'm scared I'll need to use them later. Maybe next time I'll get the mystery box. That's all I could afford at the moment, so I continued on with my journey.

At some point My eyes were finally heavy, I didn't want to stop playing so I kept trying to stay awake. Needless to say I failed and my body fell asleep...<br><br>I had a. weird dream<br><br><br><br></div>

<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tdsu5LT.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">

It started off bad. Another nightmare, which is something I'm pretty used to. But the blurry dream was interrupted, It was suddenly so lucid. You know how dreams feel? Like your far away from Neopia? Well that's how it was for a while, just a dance of blurry memories and strangeness and vague memories of the dreamland... And then it was bright and clear. Happy was there to 'cheer me up'. He talked for a while, I don't remember what his voice sounded like. We took a calming walk... He said I'd be happy someday. I hope he's right.<br><br>It was weird, I don't know how to feel about it, but I feel kind of warm. In a good way? I dunno. It was just a dream afterall.

Your bestest friend HAPPY! You control him by using the WASD keys (Keys are subject to change with each platform). W for jumping, A for moving to the left, S to crouch, and D to walk to the right!<br><br>
Simple huh? Of course it is! Oh look how cute you are smiling. Also your friend here, Smile, will provide you emotional support! As well as find things for you occasionally.</div>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/8rbnWij.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
Sometimes you'll come across angry petpets, neopets, and bosses, they'll try and attack you- Some even have Ranged attacks. You'll need to charge up your Smiley Attack with the right mouse button. You can level it up as you play to make your attacks more potent! Bigger enemies will take more attacks to make Smiley. You can't use this attack on 'Quest Saddy's' they require you to finish their quest to become happy, you can shield smaller attacks- but you'll have to use your smarts to dodge bigger ones. Don't worry! If you're hurt you can sip a healing potion.</div>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/lbUwlq0.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
This is the shopkeeper! You can find them between levels and before boss battles. You can use the neopoints you've gained from completing Saddy quests and battling. You can also level up your moves here! Those don't cost neopoints though, they cost special Smiley Face Points! Which you gain from completing objectives.</div>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/FjvNVI7.gif" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
The last thing you need to know is there's all sorts of puzzles and enemies you have to defeat with special powers! To gain these powers you can buy and find Morphing potions that give you a certain amount of times you can use them. To Sip the morphing potion press space on the equipped! To use the special power associated with them you press the right mouse button. There's all sorts of items and special powers you can gain! But remember- have fun! And make sure you use these powers wisely ;)! There's also rare power-ups you can get from making special petpets smiley, completing very hard quests, or finding treasure chests, these often come with the names 'Droplet of rainbow paint' which will give you a temporary power-up of some kind as soon as you touch it! If you get one of these special power-ups you'll still be in whatever form you were in before- so it won't waste morphing potion charges.</div>
<br><center><h1>☻ ITEMS TO LOOK OUT FOR! ☻</h1><br><div id="items">
<div align="justify">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/fvHIZzh.png"><b>BLUE UNI MORPHING POTION:</b>
Adds magic horn that magically destroys small obstacles. Can also be used as a ranged weapon and gives you the LVL 1 feather fall effect. This is a level one item and can only be used three times per level.<br style="clear: both;"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nZjU8m8.png"><b>RED KOUGRA MORPHING POTION:</b>
Adds a +2 to your jump! Making you jump higher by pouncing, it also adds the ability to slash at medium plant obstacles to break them open! This is a level one item, and can only be used three times per level.<br style="clear: both;"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/eV49xhK.png"><b>PURPLE SHOYRU MORPHING POTION:</b>
Gives you a +3 to your feather fall, as well as a windy weapon to blow away ranged weapons with your wings! When unable to reach a higher obstacle, you can use your special flying power to fly up with 2 extra double jumps! This is a level 2 item and can only be used twice per level.<br style="clear: both;"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5bzgcrf.png"><b>GREEN HISSI MORPHING POTION:</b>
This adds a special slither power to get through small holes where treasure hides! It also gives you a slashing option to break medium sized rock obstacles, and your special hissi abilities make it so when you stay still- Saddy enemies will not attack you because you naturally blend in with the ground! However it removes -1 from your jump and speed. This is a level 4 item and can only be used twice per level.<br style="clear: both;"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HOofRQ3.png"><b>DROPLET OF STEALTH:</b>
A small rare item found occasionally before stealth missions! The droplet gives you the +10 to your stealth for ~20 seconds! Making it extremely worth it- but be careful once it rubs off because it will immediately remove the +10! and for 5 seconds add a -1 to stealth!<br style="clear: both;"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jYhxFd6.png"><b>DROPLET OF PINK:</b>
This gives you a temporary +10 to your base attack- meaning your smiley attack will be extra potent against bosses and harder to beat saddys. This often shows up in the middle of boss battles or in mystery boxes! It's pretty rare!<br style="clear: both;"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Wn4LL5H.png"><b>DROPLET OF RAINBOW:</b>
One of the rarest droplets in game, this special drop gives you a +30 to your smiley attack, as well as making you temporarily invincible to all attacks. This item is only able to be found by finding certain mystery boxes. The effect lasts the longest- 45 seconds. Finding this right next to boss's is extremely rare- but useful if it happens!<br style="clear: both;"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fhfZlmk.png"><b>DROPLET OF GREY:</b>
This is a droplet no one wants to come across, they can be accidentally consumed when falling to the grey drops- and can be ran into when opening mystery chests. When consumed it gives you a -10 to your smiley attack, making Happy sad makes any petpet that was Smiley back to a saddy. Be careful!

It appears you're playing Smile. You're in a Moltara level. Your mind feels like mush, your best friend Happy speaks calmly about the state of you. It's been days, Ava, and you're tired.<br><br>
So tired.<br><br>
You haven't kept in contact with your friend's for a while- They thought you need time alone. Maybe that's true- But you wanted to finish the game. But you're so far from the end. You've never been happier though. Your mind starts to spin, and wonder. You feel a sense of dizziness and excitement.</div>

Your eyes are strained, you've been on and off playing this game over the course of a few months. Yet you've barely gotten anywhere level wise. You're not really the type to play these games, and yet here you are again, sucked into playing it again. You just had another bad weekend- and you needed an escape.

You would feel overwhelmed, if you didn't feel like this was the right choice. You've had terrible luck. But you feel like you won't ever feel terrible again.<br><br>
You clasp the mask that appears seemingly out of nowhere. You just want to be happy.

You laugh as you play- this game has given you a lot of joy over the past few months, you've been playing nearly every night. Searching for each secret, making everyone you come across happy. It's amazing to see really, dedication isn't something you see often for a little video game. It's been a while since there's been someone so dedicated to playing Smile.
<br><br>
Tonight is another bad night.</div>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/0w7ggbr.png" width="100%"><div id="textwrap">
You've been hiding yourself away in this game for a while; days and days have passed. Each day the surface of your eyes are filled with tears- your door is locked. You play to escape the agony that is your home. Happy speaks the truth- if you put the mask on you'll become happy. You'll never be sad or angry again; It'll be perfect. You've been resilient to the requests- The way their voice played with your mind like a magic spell. But today the spell was stronger than ever; Tonight you take a stand against those who took you for granted.
<br><br>
You're happy now.<br><br> We welcome you with open arms, Nedrick.</div>
