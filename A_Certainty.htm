<b>Notes to self:</b><br>
- Do not forget, these are only basic sketches of the items possible.  When placing in home make sure to experiment 
with other items and other ideas to customize the end product.<br><br>
-Cytherea007 has made an excellent guide to neohoming with good visual examples here: <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Neohoming">Neohoming</a><br><br>
-To find furniture of the required sort be sure to visit Cybraria's page: <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Bibliaphila">Bibliaphila</a>.<br><br>
-Secret3191 has created a visual guide to her Neohome Museum here: <a href="http://petpages.neopets.com/~britney1617">Britney1617</a><br><br>
-An advanced bookshelf making guide by Beenerz can be found here: <a href="http://petpages.neopets.com/~Aelfrich">Aelfrich</a><br><br><b>Technical Notes:</b><br>
- To place items at different angles press the Shift key while rotating.  This will let you turn by 10 degree increments.<br><br>
- To place items on top of walls try rotating to -180 or any diagonal position.<br><br>
- Neohoming becomes expensive fast, try to look for cheaper alternatives when a plan becomes costly.<br>
  e.g. Wock til you drop posters instead of zen drawers.<br>
Also, Loriengal9 has compiled a list of cheaper furni items here: <a href="http://petpages.neopets.com/~Takashi462">Takashi462</a><br><br>
- It is easier and more efficient to plan out a home before beginning to build.  Cuts down on demolition later.<br><br><br><br><br><a name="tv"></a>

Themed homes/rooms<br><img src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c343/Benvolio_dude/Theme.jpg"><br><br>
Themed homes are somewhat different from a standard home in that it is more difficult to substitute in different items for what is needed.  
Also with not being able to pick and choose the furni being used many times the cost ($$$) will be substantial.  Here are some plans for 
different spooky elements that could be used in such a home.<br>
Note: Not cheap<br><b>1. Grisly Bathtub:</b>  Parts-  1 black skull candle, 2 spooky bone candles, 1 spooky bathtub, approx. 4-5 cloud rugs.<br><b>2. Spider and Prey:</b>  Parts-  1 spyder foot rest, 1 spyder web rug, 1 "prey", in this case a disco squeaky petpet toy.<br><b>3. Flying Head:</b>  Parts-  1 esophagor drawer, 1 green hissi chair.<br><b>4. Jubjub of Doom:</b>  Parts-  1 earth faerie sink, red jubjub table.   Err...well actually that isn't very spooky.  In fact, it's kind of cute.  I'll just erase this later.<br><a href="#top">top</a><br><br><a name="stairs"></a> 
General Stair Tutorial<br><img src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c343/Benvolio_dude/Stairs.jpg"><br><br><b>Explanation:</b> There are many kinds and ways of doing stairs.  This will be a general explanation of the details for successful stairs.<br>
The Necessary Parts are what makes stairs stairs.  It's not necessary to use what is pictured here, but something of the sort will be required.<br>
The Unnecessary Parts are what are used in the above picture to make that design work.  They may or may not be required for a different design.<br><br><b>Necessary Parts:</b> Steps (Classic Dining Table), Bannister (popcorn garland and small table lamp and violet shelf unit)<br><b>Unnecessary Parts:</b> Shading for doorways (Wock til you drop poster and zen drawer), Height helper (fireplace, round green table, zen mirror), Flooring (dried bamboo mat).<br><br><b>Placement:</b> For the stairs to look as they should a ground level should be determined.  This is easiest accomplished by aligning with the bottom of the walls in room.  <br>
For a look of height as the stairs go up or down, the steps should be aligned to go above or below the ground level.  If there is difficulty moving items there see Technical Notes above.  <br>
Also, it is important to look at the coordinates of the stairs to make sure all of the stairs are equidistant and staggered apart from each other for straight-looking stairs.
