<a name="Basics"></a><font color="darkred" size="6"><b>The Basics</b></font><br><p><font size="4" face="arial">Food Club is a game of chance and luck. It's a great way to earn hundreds of thousands of points by basically doing nothing. However, the math and layout of the game instantly turn people away from it, and the idea of losing hard-earned neopoints can scare people. It's not hard at all once you try it out and learn how it works. This guide exists to, well, <i>guide</i> you through Food Club (called FC throughout this guide) and teach you how to bet on your own. Okay, let's start!<br><br><p>Each day, a round is held where 20 pirates face each other in a food eating competition. There are 5 different arenas, and each arena holds 4 pirates. Each arena hosts many different types of foods, and the pirates have different favorites and allergies of certain foods. This can greatly affect the outcome of the winners. <br></p><p>In each round, you can place a maximum of 10 different bets, using any combination of pirates from the different arenas. How much you can bet depends on how old your account is. The older the account, the more you can bet, and the more you can bet, the more you can win back. The formula for how much you can bet is <br><b>50 + 2 * Account Age in Days.</b> Don't worry. You don't have to memorize or calculate anything though because the betting page shows you this number already.<br></p><p>Every betting period ends at 1:45 PM NST. The actual results are displayed at 2:15 PM NST, and a new round instantly begins. This is when you find out who won in the last round. This is important because this is when you can check out and collect your winnings from that last round. You can let your winnings build up for 7 days, but after 7 days, your winnings will simply disappear and you can never get them back. <b>Unless you're going for a trophy, it's best to collect every day.</b><br></p><p>That's a lot of information! Let's have a quick overview...<br></p><ul><li>20 Pirates</li>
   <li>5 Arenas that hold 4 pirates at a time</li>
   <li>1 Round every day</li>
   <li>10 Bets or fewer per round</li>
   <li>How much you can bet depends on how old your account is</li>
   <li>Betting periods end at 1:45 PM NST</li>
   <li>Results from last and new round begins at 2:15 PM NST</li>
   <li>Winnings may stack from previous rounds, but you MUST collect before 7 days pass</li>
</ul><p>Now, your job is to bet on the winners and make a profit. But how do you know which pirates will win? Well, we'll cover that a bit later. First, we have to get you familiar with the layout of the game.

Here are a few ways to get to it:<br><ul><li>Click EXPLORE in the toolbar. Go to Krawk Island on the Neopia "globe." Click on the sign on the right that says "Food Club." Here's a screenshot to point it out.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v425/crazycricket/fc1.jpg"><br><br><br></li><li>Click GAMES in the toolbar.

Once you've found FC, there's nothing you can do on the starting page. It's just a bunch of numbers concerning the pirates' wins, losses, strength, and percentages. That's why I feel that it is important to guide people through the layout of the game.<br><p>I will be using pictures in some of these subsections, but I recommend clicking the links and following the instructions (especially if you are completely new to the game) for some hands-on experience. The links you click will be opened in <b>new tabs.</b> In doing this, you don't have to click the back and forward button over and reload pages. Let's begin.<br></p><p>First, click <b><a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/foodclub.phtml">here to go to the Pirate section.</a></b> This is the main page that you're first brought to whenever you go to FC. It lists many statistics for all 20 pirates. Your main focus here is the pirate strength and win percentage. Weight has ZERO affect on the game, and number of losses and wins don't matter since we're looking at the win percentage anyways. Notice that you can click on each pirate's name to see what foods they like and dislike.<br><br><i>Note: You can close the pirate section tab, or simply choose to follow along in that tab by clicking on the corresponding sections found at the top of that screen.</i>

Click on a pirate with 2:1 odds. However, you haven't officially chosen this pirate yet. Click the checkbox found to the left of that pirate. If you did it right, the box underneath the words "Total Odds" in the Winnings Calculator table should have 2:1 in it. Click inside the Bet Amount box and delete the 0. Type in 500. Now just click in any of the white space on the page. See how the Total Payoff changed to 1000? That's because 500 * 2 is 1000.<br><p><font size="4" face="arial">Let's add another pirate to that bet. Click on another dropdown list and choose a 2:1 pirate. Remember to click the checkbox to the left of the corresponding pirate. Your Total Odds should now be 4:1, and your Total Payoff is now 2000. If you were to click the "Place this Bet!" button <b>(DO NOT CLICK ON IT THOUGH!)</b>, that bet would be placed for you. If that bet won, you would win 2000 points. On to the next section!

The idea of betting smart is to make ten bets that cover as many combinations of winners as possible. With this in mind, you want a bet or multiple bets to hit that equal to 10:1 or higher. But why does it need to be 10:1 or higher?<br><p><font size="4">It's actually simple math. Let's say that you can bet a maximum of 2,000 points. Ideally, you want to bet the same amount of points per bet. So in all ten bets, you wagered 2000 points, for a total of 20,000 points spent altogether. Winnings are calculated by <b>Bet Amount * (First Number Shown in Odds).</b> If you hit a win of 10:1, you would get back 20,000 points (by 2,000 * 10), so you broke even. We want to profit though. If you hit 12:1, you would get back 24,000. You made 4,000 points by essentially doing nothing! But what if multiple bets win?<br><p><font size="4">Multiple wins are calculated like this: <b>Bet Amount * (Odds added together).</b> So, if you had a 4:1 and an 8:1 bet both win, you would get 12:1 back. Again, a 4,000 point profit if we used 2,000 on each bet.

<a name="How3"></a><font color="darkred" size="6"><b>How To Bet - How Odds are Determined</b></font><br><p><font size="4" face="arial">I need to explain one more important thing you should consider before making bets - how odds are determined. They're mainly determined by pirate strength. This explains why Gooblah is almost always a 2:1 since his strength is an overwhelming 93.<br><p><font size="4">Secondly, food adjustment is taken into account. This is how weaker pirates, like Young Sproggie, can end up being a 2:1 with Gooblah in the same arena. The higher their food adjustment is, the better chance they have at winning. When pirates have negative food adjustment, their chances of winning decrease, making their odds higher.<br><p><font size="4">Lastly, the pirates' win percentage is taken into account. Sometimes, you might see a pirate with 3:1 or 4:1 odds when they should actually be much higher than that. This may be because that pirate has lost for a while and is due for a win.<br><p><font size="4">And just a heads up, but sometimes the odds may not make sense. I've seen a weaker pirate have lower odds than a much stronger pirate for no reason on multiple occasions. I keep up with win percentage too, and the pirate wasn't really due for a win. There may be a hidden factor that no one has figured out yet. It's probably just random though.

<br><br><font size="4" face="arial">This example shows an extremely good day to bet. Starting out, you want to try to find arenas where you can easily spot winners. Let's go through the list of arenas and discuss what we know about each one.<br><br><b>Shipwreck:</b> This arena looks pretty good. Gooblah has the clear advantage here, and as an added bonus, he's +2, which only makes him stronger! We also have Young Sproggie with +3. His strength is only 73, but +3 can boost him a bit. The two 13:1's are Ned and Stuff. Notice how Ned has a higher strength than Sproggie, yet Ned has much higher odds. That's how food adjustment plays a role. In all, our main focus of this group is Gooblah and Sproggie.<br><br><b>Lagoon:</b> This is a decent arena, but what makes it decent? Federismo is the strongest contender with 81 strength and +3. Tailhook is right behind him with the same strength, but +2 in food adjustment. Between these two, it's a complete tossup even though Fed has a slight advantage in food. Stripey only has +2 with 74 strength, so it will be hard for him to keep up with the stronger Fed and Tailhook. Sir Edmund is the pirate with the highest odd possible (13:1), and his -1 adjustment doesn't help.<br><br><b>Treasure Island:</b> In my opinion, this is a pretty bad arena to bet on. Usually any arena without a 13:1 pirate is bad. Bonnie has a bit of a lead since he's ten points ahead of the next strongest pirate. Crossblades is the second best here, partially because of his +3 adjustment. According to the odds, Orvinn is right behind Crossblades, but his really low strength of 52 can barely keep up with the others, even with +3. Puffo has the worst odds at 10:1, but he could still win since his strength is 68 (second highest in this arena).<br><br><b>Hidden Cove:</b> This is the best kind of arena you'll see. A 2:1 against three 13:1's (well, Blackbeard is basically a 13:1 here). In these types of arenas, you get a free multiplier for all of your bets. It's not guaranteed that Scurvy will win here, but he has a huge advantage in strength AND food. Blackbeard is the upset to watch out for since he wasn't a true 13:1.<br><br><b>Harpoon Harry's:</b> This is an example of a bad arena. Two 2:1's and a middle-odd pirate is never good. Buck has strength advantage, but Franch could catch up with +2 in food. Lucky could beat both of them since his strength isn't too far from theirs. Peg Leg could in fact pull an upset too. It's just too risky to try this arena out since no pirate(s) have clear advantages over the others.

<p>Looking at our example above, we can see a few pirates that may change in odds. Blackbeard is the first I noticed. Usually 11:1 or 12:1 odds end up changing to 13:1 before the round is over.

</p><p>Secondly, Tailhook looks like he could change to a 2:1. This would hurt our winnings if we didn't take it into account.

</p><p>Third, the odds in Treasure Island look weird in my opinion. I expected a few of them to change later on (which they did), but it was hard to predict what they would change too.

<a name="How5"></a><font color="darkred" size="6"><b>How To Bet - Planning the Bets</b></font><br><p><font size="4" face="arial">So we've figured out which arenas are good to bet on, but how should we place our bets? When planning the bets, keep in mind that you only get 10 bets. You also have to consider that your winnings need to be or add up to 10:1 or more so you don't lose any money. I'm going to walk you through the betting process using our example round, but remember that there are many different ways to go about betting in a round. There isn't just one right way to bet.<br><p>We did a quick run-through of each arena and figured out which ones are good and bad. For these bets, I use Shipwreck, Lagoon, and Hidden Cove. Alternative sets could be Shipwreck, Treasure Island, and Hidden Cove OR all four of those. Now let's start betting!<br></p><p><b>Bet #1 - Gooblah + Federismo + Scurvy. Odds - 8:1.</b> This bet is simple. We chose the strongest pirates in each arena and pooled them all into one bet. It's under 10:1 though, so even if it hits, we lose money. Don't worry though, because our next bet will be a simple remedy to that. <i>Don't forget that odds are multiplied together when making a bet, not added together! That's why this bet isn't 6:1.</i><br></p><p><b>Bet #2 - Gooblah + Scurvy. Odds - 4:1.</b> This bet fixes the problem of our first bet. Now if Gooblah, Fed, and Scurvy all win, we will make 12:1 instead of 8:1. Remember my explanation of winnings being added together?<br></p><p><b>Bet #3 - Gooblah + Tailhook + Scurvy. Odds - 12:1.</b> This one is a must because Tailhook VS Federismo is a complete tossup here. Even if Tailhook changed to a 2:1, our second bet would fix the 8:1 problem.<br></p><p><b>Bet #4 - Gooblah + Ol' Stripey + Scurvy. Odds - 24:1.</b> This safely covers Stripey in case he tries to pull a mini-upset (he is +2 after all). Plus, if it hits, you more than double your points.<br></p><p><b>Bet #5 - Sproggie + Federismo + Scurvy. Odds - 28:1.</b> This is where other possible ways to bet on this round veer off. Some people may have chosen to bet Sproggie + Scurvy, which is fine since it was 14:1. However, at the time that round occurred, Gooblah had won six days in a row. I knew he was bound to lose some time, so I made this bet. The next two bets support it.

</p><p><b>Bet #6 - Sproggie + Tailhook + Scurvy. Odds - 42:1.</b> Again, we're hoping Sproggie upsets and beats Gooblah. This one helps cover the possibility of Tailhook winning.

</p><p><b>Bet #7 - Sproggie + Stripey + Scurvy. Odds - 84:1.</b> Same as above, except we're covering the possibility of Ol' Stripey winning in Lagoon. Plus, if this bet actually hits, we win over eight times what we put in!

</p><p><b>Bet #8 - Blackbeard. Odds - 12:1.</b> These last three bets could be pretty much anything. We could make some outrageous bets, or we could play it safe. In this instance, we play it safe. This bet is what we call a "safety bet." Blackbeard isn't a true 13:1 at this point, so he has better chances than Squire and Fairfax at winning. Notice how we didn't put a Gooblah as a multiplier because there is the possibility that he could lose.

</p><p><b>Bet #9 - Ned + Scurvy. Odds - 26:1.</b> Here, we use Scurvy as a multiplier since he doubles the odds. We're <i>almost</i> 100% positive that Scurvy will win, so this isn't too risky. With Ned being a weird wildcard, he could pull an upset. Therefore, we've got him covered.

</p><p><b>Bet #10 - Gooblah + Sir Edmund + Scurvy. Odds - 52:1.</b> This bet could be anything you wanted. If you wanted to be really safe, you could bet Stuff + Scurvy, or a single bet on Fairfax. Instead, we cover the possibility of an upset happening in Lagoon. It's very unlikely, but if it happened, we've still got a chance at winning.

<td><font size="4" face="arial">This method focuses solely on 2:1's, 3:1's, and 4:1's. Ideally, the better wants to mix and match the low-odd pirates from each arena. In doing that, even if an upset occurs in one arena, a decent profit can still occur. I've actually had several people message me about this one, and all of them claimed to have success.</font></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><font size="4" face="arial">2:1's ONLY</font></td>

<td><font size="4" face="arial">As the name implies, only 2:1's are bet on in this one. Since 2:1's win more than 60% of the time, this method isn't too shabby provided you know what you're doing. In my opinion, limiting yourself to 8 bets could help since you would only need to match three 2:1's just to break even.</font></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><font size="4" face="arial">Gooblah ONLY</font></td>

Since he wins more than 60% of the time, the better doubles his money more than half of the time. For those who can bet 5,000, they can make an extra 5,000 easily with this method.

This can be classified as a pseudo-method since it's not really a standalone strategy, but it's best to combine it with other methods.

<td><font size="4" face="arial">In this one, every bet has 5 different pirates in it. The better tries to cover as many possible combinations of winners as he/she can. This is extremely risky because every arena is used, even the ones with bad odds. One weird winner could ruin it all.</font></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><font size="4" face="arial">100% OVERLAP?!</font></td>

<td align="center"><font size="4" face="arial">EXTREMELY HIGH</font></td>

<td><font size="4" face="arial">This one is similar to 1 and 2 All the Way, except the better chooses 5 pirates to completely rely on! Different combinations of the five pirates are used in each bet. If all five pirates are guessed correctly, then all ten bets hit! Even if three or four are guessed correctly, a decent profit is gained.

<p>For example, let's say you think Gooblah, Scurvy, Crossblades, Tailhook, and Fairfax are all going to win in their arenas. Your first bet would be all 5 of them. The second bet would be Gooblah + Scurvy + Crossblades + Tailhook. The third bet would be Gooblah + Scurvy + Tailhook + Fairfax. See how it's just different combinations of them? You would repeat this until you made ten bets.</p></font></td></tr></table></center>

<p><font size="4" face="arial">This section is for all of you trophy collectors out there. It's short though because going for a trophy in FC is pretty straightforward.

<p>Remember, you only have 7 days to keep your winnings saved up for a round until they expire. The best time to start saving up is the 25th or 26th of each month. That gives you about a week to start saving for the very beginning of the next month.

</p><p>The best way to bet on these weeks is to bet extremely risky. Make sure you have plenty of points that you don't mind losing. This game has a lot of luck tied into it, so it may take you a few months to finally get it.

</p><p>Account age plays a significant role in getting an FC trophy too. The older the account is, the more that person wins back. Here's an example sent in by sachiboy: <i>An example is the other day when Crossblades won and there were a few of us who won at 104:1. There was a 76 month account who won 479856 NP but my account which is 100 months old got 630656 NP. That could be the difference between getting a trophy and <b>not</b> getting a trophy.</i>

</p><p>It's also possible to earn a trophy in the middle or end of a month if you win enough. If your style is to bet risky each day, then you have a slightly better chance at doing this.

<a name="FAQ"></a><font color="darkred" size="6"><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></font><br><p><font size="4" face="arial"><font color="darkred">Q: How many bets can I place?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: 10. That's in the guide...<br><p><font color="darkred">Q: Exactly when does the 7th day end to collect winnings?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: For an in-depth explanation, scroll to the bottom of <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopets.com/~LordPuffikins">LordPuffikin's page.</a><br><p><font color="darkred">Q: Do I have to have the points on-hand, or does it take it from my bank account?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: Your points must be on-hand. I don't believe any game can or ever will take your points from the bank...<br><p><font color="darkred">Q: Oops, I accidentally placed my bet wrong. Can I take it back?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: Sorry, but you can't take a bet back. Always look over your bet a few times before you officially place it, especially the checkbox areas.<br><p><font color="darkred">Q: Numerically, how much does food add to strength?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: No one knows if it truly increases strength or if it just increases their chances of winning. I know that sounds like a paradox, but it's true. If it does add to strength, no one knows the exact numbers. I believe it adds to strength, but by how much depends on which pirate it is.<br><p><font color="darkred">Q: Why don't you cover how to calculate food adjustment in this guide?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: It doesn't really need a long explanation. If a pirate likes a food, give his adjustment +1. If he's allergic, it's -1. If a food is a favorite AND allergy at the same time, it's +0. Tally up the total, and the higher the total is, the stronger the pirate becomes that round.<br><p><font color="darkred">Q: I read/heard/think that food doesn't even play a role in the game. Is this true?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: I can say with 99.9% certainty that food does play an integral part in the game. How else can you explain the occurrences of weaker pirates having good odds when their food adjustment is high? Better yet, how could you explain Orvinn having a better win percentage than Squire and Stuff?<br><p><font color="darkred">Q: Help! A round completed but I still have my current bets from last round! What happened?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: This is a known glitch that has only happened a few times throughout the life of FC. Don't worry though, because you didn't lose all of your money. The round never finished. Just think of it as a round that lasted for two days.<br><p><font color="darkred">Q: Why should I play Food Club?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: It's one of the easiest ways to make loads of points on this site. I spend about 30 minutes a day calculating and placing my bets, then I just wait on the results. I'm too slow to restock, and I don't want to spend hours playing games on this site.<br><p><font color="darkred">Q: Did you make up that example round in the How to Bet section?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: Nope, everything in that round was real, winners and all. It was round 3747.<br><p><font color="darkred">Q: You don't have a trophy in Food Club. What makes you so qualified to make this guide?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: Honestly, I don't ever go for trophies in games. I could've had bronze or silver by now, but I never save my winnings.<br><p><font color="darkred">Q: Why not go for the trophy though?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: Um, I just don't feel like it? I don't know. As far as I'm concerned, there are people out there with tons of trophies. Is one more trophy on my bland lookup really going to impress someone?<br><p><font color="darkred">Q: Why do you always misspell "hidden" on your bets page?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: The word "hidden" breaks the table on pet lookups for some odd reason. Quickly deleting a "d" is the fastest remedy.

<p><font color="darkred">Q: Why did you make this guide?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: I wanted to help people who wanted to learn how to play. I don't believe someone should just copy bets 100% of the time to make easy money.<br><p><font color="darkred">Q: If you're so against copying bets, then why do you post yours?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: I never said I was against posting bets. I started out just copying bets, and I began noticing trends and betting patterns. With this, I taught myself how to bet on my own.<br><p><font color="darkred">Q: Why do you like Food Club so much?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: I've always been interested in statistics, and I enjoy playing games. Someone finally put the two together.<br><p><font color="darkred">Q: Other games like poker and Yahtzee have statistics. What makes this more appealing than those?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: I'm a major in Computer Information Systems, so the coding behind FC intrigues me. There's a lot that goes on behind the scenes in this game.<br><p><font color="darkred">Q: So you know some stuff about programming. Do you have any idea of how the game runs?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: Well, I'm sure it's a really complicated script that is set to run once a day. I have a few theories on how the game determines the winners though. The "exploding dice" system could be one, but no one will ever know.<br><p><font color="darkred">Q: Could someone find out how the game truly determines winners and inevitably guess all 5 pirates correct each round?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: I don't think the programmers of FC themselves could determine the winners of each round. You can program percentages and odds into scripts to say things like, "60% chance this will happen; 25% chance this will happen; 15% chance this will happen." Knowing exactly how and what food actually affects though would give someone a big advantage.<br><p><font color="darkred">Q: I sent you a friend request. Why did you refuse it?<br><font color="darkgreen">A: I don't accept friend requests from random people.<br><p align="right"><a href="//www.neopets.com/~jawsnapper0991#top">↑ Back to Top ↑</a></p></font></font></p></font></font></p></font></font></p></font></font></p></font></font></p></font></font></p></font></font></p></font></font></p></font></font></p></font></font></p></font></font></p></font></font></p></font></font></p></font></font></p></font></font></p></font></font></p></font></font></p></font></font></p></font></font></p></font></font></font></p></td></tr></table><br><br><hr><br><br><p></p><div align="center">

</p><ul><li>Two 13:1's win in the same round about once a month.</li>

<li>13:1's win more often than 8:1's, 9:1's, 10:1's, 11:1's, and 12:1's COMBINED. This may be explained by 13:1 being more common than the other high-odd numbers.</li>
