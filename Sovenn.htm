Heyo! This page is to indicate and identify highly sought out Neocash wearables or commonly referred as 'Populars' by the Neocash Chat. This page is very much inspired by the previous Popular Guides, /~Ala and /~Lyl.<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_acc_lenny_glasses.gif" style="float: right; margin-right: 10px;"><p>

This popular guide is divided into what is seasonally inclined as a popular as well as including the ones that are not. Reported trade history will be listed along with the items presented and we are open to what trends are coming along, so please contribute if you can! Also check out our <a href="/~happyhalloween_7876">Archives Page</a> for wearables that were removed by vote and <a href="/~Grreggory">Scroll Mode</a> for easier viewing accessibility to all trade reports.<br></p><h1>Update Log (we retired Jul 6, 2020)

<h1>Sitely &amp; Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<div class="scroll">
<strong>How do you determine is a popular?</strong><br>
We did a few surveys and poll threads on the NCC about this and there were tons of variables. How often people would see "X" item in their Highlights, Hard To Part With (HTPW), "GRAB A CROWBAR" lists. Then there's like the demand factor and a couple of items in there that were historically listed as a popular that we felt that should be kept on these popular lists. As a reminder, do know this listing is, in fact, broad to cover a variety of what could be considered a popular in the NCC community.<p>

</p><div align="right">
<table border="0"><tr><td><i><font color="3D415C">Let's just call GBCs Pops. /s</font></i></td>
<td><img src="//images.neopets.com/dome/npcs/00007_9f6d5cc6f1_balthazar/portrait_7.png" width="100" height="100" alt="border='0'"></td>
</tr></table></div><br><strong>Are you recording trades that were not reported?</strong><br>
We are not, because we feel it would be best to know the trade that was conducted by trader/tradee for accurate representation rather than hearing rumors of something out of the ordinary.<p>

<strong>So what's the specific details for this stuff?</strong><br>
Trade reports are organized by the following:<br>
MONTH YEAR [OPTIONAL: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SUCH AS NC SHUFFLES, RERELEASE, ETC]<br>
REPORTER TRADED ||FOR|| REPORTED RECEIEVED [IF BLANK MEANS FAIR, OTHERWISE STATED]</p><p>

If NC Custom is involved, then it goes at the end of the trade (ITEMS [TOTAL # NC Custom]).<br>
If GBCs are involved, then it goes at the front of the trade (# GBCs + ITEMS).<br>
For this petpage, we do not consider GBCs as Custom due to recognizable complications.</p><p>

<strong>Are you recording NC wearables that are not in the Grandpops Listing?</strong><br>
Yes, we are and we don't mind! There are NC wearables that are not considered "popular" to be listed (too niche/HTPW), but we are happy to supply the trade information for the NC wearable in mind if any is available. Also, it'd be best to create a VC thread and ask NC Value Guide owners too.</p><p>

</p><div align="center"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_jjpb_confusedarrowsign.gif"><br><i>Help I can't find my value!</i></div><br><strong>Are you recording Pre-Trades?</strong><br>
No, because we would want to avoid situations where the trade does not go through or there's a sudden event within the scheduled trade date.<p>

<strong>Are you recording NC Shuffle Trades?</strong><br>
Yes, we are, although they will be tagged that they did originate from an NC Shuffle Trade due to the complexity of the whole transaction. SO PLEASE STATE THAT THE REPORTED TRADE HAS ORIGINATED FROM NC SHUFFLES IF SO.</p><p>

<strong>Are you recording trades of newer items that become rampant upon release?</strong><br>
We would say that's a mixed bag, but leaning towards no... We like new things but do we just like them because they are new? I would give the item some time and look back if it deems to be worthwhile in a future evaluation board or so. It's probably best if you can report your trades to a more dedicated petpage such a Value Guide.</p><p>

</p><div align="center"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_trink_seatonmoon.gif"><br><i>Say it if ain't so!</i></div><br><strong>I don't believe "X" should be here AT ALL? You should add "X" instead!!!!</strong><br>
Feel free to drop me a suggestion, this is by no means a completed list and is bound for changes throughout the years. There's a Neomail prompt provided on the Intro page to use if you'd like.<p>

<strong>Why even have a trading section of each item listed here?</strong><br>This might be helpful if a value guide has an item unlisted of value and/or what to expect what to trade for the destined item. The item there might not have a value because there hasn't been enough [recent] trading data to determine a value, but it is nice to know in some parts what an item has traded in the past if the item is or has become popular. So please do your part and report your trades to a value guide to support your fellow NCCers!</p><p>

<strong>Are you looking for help with the page?</strong><br>
Yeah it's just Chips (mikurubeam297) who maintains this page and doing all the images/recording, so feel free to drop him a Neomail if you're interested.</p><p>
