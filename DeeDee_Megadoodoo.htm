THIS LEAVES US WITH THE SAME REGULARS WHO HAVE BEEN HERE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND WITHOUT FRESH NEW FACES NEOPETS REALLY FEELS LIKE IT IS ON THE DECLINE! WELL I AM HERE TO CHANGE THAT!! THIS GUIDE WILL EXPLAIN ALL THE MANY WAYS THAT YOU CAN MAKE LITERALLY MILLIONS AND HAVE ALL THE RARE PETS AND ITEMS YOU WANT AND SHOW THEM OFF AND MAKE EVERYONE ELSE JEALOUS AND HATE YOU!!! LETS DIVE RIGHT IN!!

<br>
SO YEAH WHEN THIS NONSENSE WAS RELEASED I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE END OF NEOPETS AS WE KNEW IT BECASUE IT WOULD TOTALLY RUIN THE ECONOMY BY MAKING NEOPOINTS FALL FROM THE SKY BUT IT'S BEEN A MAINSTAY LIKE REALLY ITS JUST ANOTHER WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO LOGIN ONCE A DAY AND ONCE THEIR ONLINE MAYBE THEY'LL STAY A WHILE!! I GET THE MARKETING BUT IT REALLY CAUSES THERE TO BE TOO MANY NEOPOINTS IN EXISTENCE BUT ANYWAY ALL IT IS IS A DUMB SLOT MACHINE WITH A 25 DAY CYCLE SO LIKE DURING THE FIRST FEW DAYS YOU'LL GET SMALL AMOUNTS OF NEOPOINTS THAT INCREASE EACH DAY AND THEN AFTER LIKE A WEEK YOU'LL GET LIKE 18K OR 19K EACH SPIN AND THEN ON THE 25TH DAY IN A ROW YOU'LL GET 100K AND THEN THE NEXT DAY THE CYCLE STARTS OVER SO THE KEY IS TO NOT MISS A DAY AND YOU'LL GET HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NEOPOINTS FOR LITERALLY LOGGING IN!! KINDA DUMB BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS

<font color="3396ff" size="7">
<br>
SO YOU GET FIVE OF THESE FETCH QUESTS EVERY DAY SO ON THE BASIC JOBS PAGE YOU GO THROUGH ALL OF THE POTENTIAL JOB LISTINGS WHERE THEY ASK YOU TO FETCH A VARYING NUMBER OF THE SAME ITEM AND BRING THEM BACK AND THERE WILL BE A NEOPOINT REWARD WHICH IS STATED AND THE JOBS ARE LISTED IN ORDER FROM OLDEST TO NEWEST SO WHAT YOU WANNA DO IS GO TO THE VERY LAST PAGE AND WORK YOUR WAY BACKWARDS WHEN SEARCHING BECAUSE THE ONES AT THE BEGINNING ARE ALWAYS THE WORST LIKE YOU WILL LITERALLY LOSE NEOPOINTS IF YOU DO THOSE!! IF YOU ARE UNSURE THE VALUE OF AN ITEM I WOULD SEARCH FOR IT IN THE SHOP WIZARD AND THEN ADD UP HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST AND COMPARE IT TO THE REWARD TO SEE IF ITS WORTH TAKING THAT JOB AND THERE IS AN UP TO 25% BONUS IF YOU COMPLETE THE JOB QUICKLY SO KEEP THAT IN MIND!! THIS IS A VERY CONSISTENT WAY OF MAKING NEOPOINTS FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS JUST STARTING OUT

<font color="3396ff" size="7"><br>
OK SO THIS IS REALLY ANNOYING AND MIND NUMBING BUT IT IS A VIABLE OPTION TO LEARN AND MAKE NEOPOINTS ON SO I HAVE TO INCLUDE IT SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU GO TO A SHOP LIKE THE BOOK SHOP OR TOY SHOP AND YOU REFRESH EVERY FEW SECONDS WAITING FOR RARE ITEMS TO STOCK AND YOU BUY THEM UP REALLY FAST BEFORE ANYONE ELSE CAN AND YOU HAVE TO BE QUICK BECAUSE THE RARER THE ITEM THE FASTER IT SELLS AND ONCE YOU BUY IT THEN YOU RESELL IT AT MARKET VALUE AND MAKE A PROFIT!! THIS IS NOT CONSISTENT AT ALL AND YOU WILL HAVE YOUR GOOD DAYS AND YOUR BAD DAYS BUT PERSISTANCE PAYS OFF AND YOU WILL GET BETTER OVER TIME

<img src="//images.neopets.com/caption/caption_237.gif"><br><font color="red" size="7"><b>HALF PRICE DAY</b>
<font color="3396ff" size="7"><br>
ON THE 3RD OF EVERY MONTH LITERALLY EVERYTHING IN NEOPIA IS 50% OFF THE ORIGINAL PRICE FOR THE ENTIRE 24 HOUR DURATION OF THE DAY!! I AM NOT LYING THIS IS SERIOUSLY A THING THAT HAPPENS!! I TOLD YOU THE ECONOMY WAS BROKEN!! NOBODY IS GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT THOUGH LIKE ON THE 3RD IF YOU EXPLORE THE SITE THERE IS NO MENTION OF IT WHATSOEVER ANYWHERE ITS LIKE NEOPIAS BEST KEPT SECRET LIKE ITS NOT ON THE NEWS FEED OR ON THE NEOBOARDS OR EVERN IN THE SHOPS THEMSELVES YOU JUST HAVE TO MARK IT DOWN IN YOUR OWN PERSONAL CALENDAR WHICH IM SURE YOU DONT USE BECAUSE NOBODY USES THOSE THINGS ANYMORE BUT LIKE FIND A WAY TO SET A REMINDER!! THE SAVINGS ARE OFF THE CHARTS!! TAKE A VACATION DAY OFF OF WORK AND JUST BUY ITEMS FROM NEOPETS FOR THE ENTIRE 24 HOURS 

</font></font></p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/new_tradingcards/lg_ruki_day_2004.gif"><br><font color="red" size="7"><b>BATTLEDOME</b>
<font color="3396ff" size="7">
<br> THE ONE PLAYER BATTLEDOME AGAINST A CPU CAN WIN YOU LOADS OF VALUABLE ITEMS YOU CAN SELL FOR NEOPOINTS!! THERE IS LOTS OF JUNK PRIZES TOO BUT IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE OPPONENT! YOU CAN WIN UP TO 15 ITEMS AND 1500 NEOPOINTS PER DAY... I PERSONALLY GO FOR THE JETSAM ACE SINCE YOU CAN WIN NERKMIDS AND THEY ALL SELL FOR LIKE 150K EACH WHICH IS CRAZY LIKE JUST ONE NERKMID BLOWS AWAY PRETTY MUCH EVERY OTHER METHOD THAT IS IN THIS GUIDE BUT SOMETIMES YOU GET MULTIPLE NERKMIDS A DAY AND IT GIVES YOU CODESTONES AND NEOCOLA TOKENS AS WELL JUST A FANTASTIC OPPONENT!! THE ONLY WAY TO BATTLE JETSAM ACE IS TO BE A PREMIUM MEMBER WHICH REQUIRES PAYING REAL MONEY AND LETS BE HONEST IT'S WORTH IT!! BY GIVING NEOPETS REAL MONEY WE ARE HELPING TO PAY EMPLOYEE SALARIES AND THE MORE EMPLOYEES THEY HAVE THE BETTER QUALITY THE SITE WILL BE!! YOU ARE SINGLE HANDEDLY KEEPING NEOPETS RUNNING BY GIVING THEM YOUR REAL MONEY!! OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT FINANCIAL SITUATIONS BUT IF YOU ARE ABLE TO I WOULD HIGHLY CONSIDER PAYING REAL MONEY TO UNLOCK JETSAM ACE AND GO OUT AND WIN SOME NERKMIDS!! 

</font></font></p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/caption/caption_214.gif"><br><font color="red" size="7"><b>TRAINING </b><br><font color="3396ff" size="7">
OH BUT THE JETSAM ACE IS TOO POWERFUL FOR MY PUNY LITTLE WEAK NEOPET??? HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO TAKE ON THAT THING?? YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO INVEST IN TRAINING SESSIONS FOR YOUR PET!! CAPTAIN THREELEGS WILL TRAIN YOUR NEOPET IN EXCHANGE FOR DUBLOONS AT THE KRAWK ISLAND ACADEMY AND AFTER THAT THIS  WEIRD NINJA DUDE WILL TRAIN YOUR NEOPET FOR CODESTONES AT THE MYSTERY ISLAND TRAINING SCHOOL AND THEN SOMETIME AFTER THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY RED CODESTONES ELSEWHERE BUT YAH YOU'LL NEVER GET THERE LOL!!! LETS NOT WORRY ABOUT THAT.... OF COURSE THESE COURSES TAKE TIME AND ALSO CAN BE QUITE COSTLY SO IF YOU HAVE REAL MONEY TO SPEND I WOULD RECOMMEND PURCHASING A FAERIE QUEST FORTUNE COOKIE WHICH WILL GIVE YOU ONE FREE FAERIE QUEST EACH DAY TO BOOST YOUR STATS IN EXCHANGE FOR 50 NEOCASH AND WILL LAST 10 DAYS I THINK SO THE STATS YOU WANT TO INCREASE ARE STRENGTH AND DEFENCE AND HIT POINTS AND AT THE TRAINING SCHOOLS YOU WILL NEED TO ALSO INCREASE LEVEL BECAUSE ITS LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE CAN ONLY GO UP BY TWO TIMES THE LEVEL BUT OTHERWISE LEVEL AND MOVEMENT ARE USELESS IN BATTLE

<font color="3396ff" size="7"><br>
THE FOOD CLUB IS APPARANTLY A FANTASTIC METHOD OF MAKING NEOPOINTS OVER THE LONG TERM OR SO I'VE HEARD BUT UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO PLAY FOOD CLUB AND IT HAS A BIT OF A LEARNING CURVE THAT I DONT CARE ENOUGH TO TAKE ON BUT BASICALLY YOU BET ON SOME PIRATES AND EITHER WIN OR LOSE SO ITS A RISK BUT ITS SUPPOSE TO BE PROFITABLE OVER TIME IF YOU PLAY IT PROPERLY I DONT KNOW SO YEAH IF YOU ARE INTERESTED THEN WHAT YOU DO IS YOU GO ON JELLYNEO.COM AND SEARCH FOR THEIR FOOD CLUB GUIDE AND GAIN YOUR VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE THERE!! JELLYNEO IS SERIOUSLY A GREAT FAN SITE FOR NEOPETS LIKE I DONT KNOW WHY YOU'RE STILL READING THIS INSTEAD OF BEING OVER THERE

MOST OF THESE ARE PRETTY TERRIBLE AND UNDERWHELMING TO BE HONEST BUT ITS STILL WORTH DOING THEM AS THERE IS A CHANCE YOU COULD WIN BIG!! YOU PROBABLY WON'T BUT THERE'S A CHANCE!! BUT OTHERWISE MOST OF THESE HAVE PRIZES THAT HAVE NOT CHANGED IN LIKE 20 YEARS AND THEREFORE NEVER ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION

<font color="ff00ff" size="7">WHEEL OF EXCITEMENT: <font color="3396ff" size="7"> THERE ARE SO MANY EXCITING POSSIBILITIES!!
