<img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/whk7trrm/1/6.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;"><p>Hi there, friend! Welcome to <i><b>The Food Journal</b></i>: a pet directory dedicated to our food neopets through the perspective of <b>SCIENCE</b>. </p>

<p>The scope of this directory will focus on <i><b>food-inspired pet colors and pet names based on real foods or food science concepts </b></i>. As someone who is starting off their real-life career in this field, I personally feel that it is so important for everyone to understand how and why our foods are prepared or behave in different ways. There's a lot more to food than what we perceive, and there's always something new to learn as well; that's what makes the field so interesting! </p>

<p><b>**FYI: This directory is very image heavy. Please give it a few minutes for the page to load!</b></p>

<h3>Listing Information &amp; Rules</h3>

<div class="box" style="float: left; width: 100%; padding: 1em;">
<center>
<h5>General Guidelines</h5>
<p>- Permanent pets only. No UFT or lab rats.</p>
<p>- If your pet is no longer permanent or changes color, please neomail Cassie (toadrocks12) to update your listing.</p>

<hr><h5>Painted Pets</h5>
<p>- To be listed in any of the painted pets category, the pet must be painted as a food-based color, as indicated in the navigation section.</p>

<hr><h5>Food/Food Science Pet Names</h5>
<p>- Any pet name under this specific category must be a real word and spelled correctly or as accurately as possible. If it's a word that I'm not familiar with, I usually look it up to make sure it meets this criteria before updating this section of the directory.</p>

<p>- If the Neopet has an obvious misspelled RW name (e.g. Marshmallow vs Mharschmellow) but is painted as a food color, they will only be listed in its respective food color category.</p>

<p>- Due to naming restrictions with accents and spaces, foreign spellings and certain compound words can also be included as long as the spelling is as accurate as possible. With foreign spellings, please make it clear as to what language the word corresponds to.</p>

<p>- Food Science pet names can be related to any science words that can be applied to the actual subject - such as the names of chemical reactions, chemical molecules, processes, food microbiology, etc. If you don't know whether your pet meets that qualification, Cassie can help you out with that!</p>

<p>Now you may be asking yourself the following question: <b>What is Food Science?</b>. For many of us, we simply look at food as a thing to eat because it's there. When we go to supermarkets, we just expect food to magically appear on the shelves without too much thought. A lot of extensive work goes into the products we consume, and it's so important for everyone to be educated on these topics.</p>

<p>Food Science is defined as the following per the <b>Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) </b> web page: <i>Food science draws from many disciplines, including biology, chemical engineering, and biochemistry to better understand food processes and improve food products for the general public. As the stewards of the field, food scientists study the physical, microbial, and chemical makeup of food. They apply their findings to develop the safe, nutritious, and sustainable foods and innovative packaging that line supermarket shelves today".</i></p> 

<p>Food science uses the most cutting-edge scientific knowledge and tools to creating foods that contribute taste, nutrition, sustainability, and sustenance to an increasing world population. We look into what consumers are looking for in food and create products that meet their needs. The people who work in the food industry are essential for keeping us going, and everything we do is critical.</p>

<h4>Careers in Food Science</h4>
<p>Food Science is quite massive in my opinion, and there's a lot of ways people can contribute to this field:</p>

<ul><li><b>Product Development</b>: Product development involves creating new recipes (formulations) that meet consumer demand, nutrition, and affordability.</li>
<li><b>Food Flavorists</b>: Flavorists use scientific techniques to extract and create new flavors for food.</li>
<li><b>Quality Control and Microbiology</b>: Quality and food microbiologists work to ensure our food is safe to consume and meets product standards.</li>
<li><b>Food Engineering</b>: This discipline utilizes engineering knowledge to create large-scale processing protocols, packaging materials, and so forth.</li>
<li><b>Food Sensory</b>: We use food sensory to get consumer feedback during the development process and to make sure the food that we are currently making is widely accepted.</li>
<li><b>Food Marketing</b>: This field utilizes marketing and sales techniques to promote new products, find the newest trends in the food industry, and more!</li>
</ul><h4>Food Science Resources</h4>
<p>To learn more about Food Science, you can look up the following resources!</p>

<ul><li><b>Institute of Food Technologists (IFT)</b>: IFT is our main group/hub for everything related to the food industry!</li>
<li><b>Fennema's Food Chemistry</b>: This is a Food Chemistry textbook that almost every food scientist or student has referred to at some point.</li>
<li><b>The Food Lab</b>: A cookbook by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt that also explains different topics through a scientific perspective.</li>
<li><b>My Food Job Rocks! </b>: This online blog by Veronica Hilsop is not only an excellent look into what we do as food scientists, but you can also learn a lot of really neat things as well!</li>

<center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/paintbrush_biscuit.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_battlebiscuit_basic.gif"></center>

<br><p><b>Biscuit</b> is a color that can be used for both Neopets and Petpets. The color was released back in 2006 during a random theme day; which was inspired by biscuits! This design has a tan/light brown base color with darker brown accents/chunks that resemble chocolate chips. This color can be obtained via paintbrush, lab ray, fountain faerie, premium perk, or morphing potion.</p>

<p><b>History</b>: Biscuits are a quick bread that are typically consumed all over the world. This typically uses flour, a fat (e.g. butter), a leavening agent, and milk or water. The name originates from the french language - where 'bis' means 'twice' and 'cuit' means 'cooked'. Depending on the region, alternate forms include 'Cookies' 'Scones', etc.</p>

<p><b>Food Science 101 - Leavening</b>: Leavening is a chemical process used in breads and other baking applications. Leavening agents such as baking soda, yeast, baking powder, etc. react with the starch and protein molecules within the dough. When used in combination with heat, the molecules react and release water and carbon dioxide in the process, thus causing the dough to rise, and also form the tiny air pockets or holes that we see in the body of the food.</p>

<br><p><b>Candy</b> was the winning color selection in the 2017 Paint Wars poll. This color can be obtained through a paintbrush, lab ray, premium perk, or by completing a fountain faerie quest. This design varies with bright vibrant colors, resembling hard candies, chocolates, or gumdrops.</p>

<p><b>History</b>: Candies are a confectionary food product that are typically prepared as a mixture of sugar or sugar substitute and liquid such as water or milk to form a syrup. The origins of candies date back thousands of years ago where fruits and nuts were combined with honey. Over time, industrialization introduced candy into the market, and it was also a new opportunity to introduce new flavors, caramels, hard candies, chocolates, and more. Though candies are not the most nutritious thing to consume, it typically has a very long shelf life due to the amount of sugar used, which makes it difficult for microbes to live in.</p>

<p><b>Food Science 101 - Sugar</b>: From a chemical perspective, sugar is a carbohydrate that has a sweet flavor when eaten. It can be broken up into two different categories. <i>Simple Sugars</i> - also known as monosaccharides include glucose, fructose, and galactose. <i>Compound Sugars</i> are two monosaccharides bonded together with a glycosidic bond; and these include sucrose (Glucose + fructose), Lactose (Glucose + Galactose) and Maltose (Glucose + Glucose). Not every sugar has the same amount of sweetness intensity, and sucrose is considered to be the 'Gold Standard'. </p>

<br><p><b>Chocolate</b> is a color that can be used for both Neopets and Petpets, with the color being released back in 2005. The only way the color can be obtained is through the fountain faerie, premium perk, and lab ray for neopets. PetPets can only be painted chocolate through the PetPet lab ray. Chocolate neopets are often designed with a chocolate and whipped cream; and sometimes further accented with toppings such as sprinkles or cherries. On Neopets, you can also obtain the <i>Chocolate!</i> avatar by purchasing a chocolate item that is ranked 90 or higher from the Chocolate Factory.</p>

<p><b>History</b>: Chocolate comes from the fruit of the cacao plant that originates in Central and South America. The ancient Aztecs and Mayans often used it for a source of currency and ceremonies, and celebrations. It eventually made its way into Europe and the North Americas, and Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter is recognized for being the first person to invent milk chocolate by adding dried milk powder to it.</p>

<p><b>Food Science 101 - Chocolate Processing</b>: As you know, chocolate originates from the Cacao plant. Cocoa beans are first sieved and cleaned to remove unwanted material and then removed from its shell (Breaking and winnowing), leaving the <i>cocoa nib</i>. The cocoa nibs are then sterilized to remove any harmful bacteria. Some chocolate producers include an alkilization step where potassium or sodium carbonate is added to increase the pH and improve flavor/color during processing. 
<br><br>The cocoa nib is then roasted and milled 
 to produce cocoa liquor (contributes to chocolate smoothness). The remaining fat in the cocoa nibs (Cocoa butter) are partially removed through pressing and pressure, which then forms a sort of cake. This cocoa nib cake is then ground up into powder, and is then used for additional mixing (Adding sugar, milk fat, milk powder), refining, conching (Adding texture, flavour, and reaching desired thickness through heating/mixing at a certain temperature), and tempering (Ensure good appearance of chocolate, and mitigate chocolate crystallization).</p>

<br><p><b>Custard</b> was first released as a color in 2005. Like the name implies, both Neopets and petpets can be painted entirely out of custard. Since there is no paintbrush available, the only way to obtain this color is through a fountain faerie dip, premium perk, or lab ray. </p>

<p><b>History</b>: Traditionally, custards are a milk or cream-based mixture that is gently heated and thickened with egg yolks. Historically, custard can be traced back all the way to the Ancient Roman times, where it was often consumed on its own or for pastries- specifically tarts and pies. Nowadays, custards can be used in both sweet or savory applications. Some other examples of sweet applications include pastry cream for desserts and frozen custard; while savory can include quiches or Chawanmschi (Japanese steamed egg Custard dish with extra vegetables, fish cake, etc.).</p>

<p><b>Food Science 101 - Custards and Eggs</b>: Eggs are one of the most versatile ingredients that currently exist. A large egg can contain up to 6 grams of protein and also contribute a lot of essential nutrients for growth and development. Within custards, egg whites are typically not used since the egg yolk not only contains the needed protein to form the food's integral gel-like structure, but it also provides additional thickening properties.<br><br>
To prepare custards, milk, egg yolks, sugar, and salt are whisked together and cooked over a gentle heat source. Gentle heating is an integral step, otherwise the eggs will begin to overcook and curdle as a result. From a molecular perspective, the proteins within the egg yolk start to react to the heating process and slowly begin to denature, or 'unwrap' itself. As a result, the proteins molecules are more likely to start interacting with the sugar, salt, and milk (Which also contains water molecules), and bind onto one another, which forms the integral gel like consistency that we see in the finished product. </p>

<br><p><b>Ice</b> was first released on September 20, 2004. This color is available to both neopets and petpets, and does not have a specific paintbrush or morphing potions associated with the color. As of now, the color can only be obtained through the lab ray or a premium perk.</p>

<p>Interestingly, ice boris are excluded from the lab ray and originally obtained by downloading an exclusive Neopets/Yahoo toolbar in 2004, thus increasing their rarity. However, they can now be obtained through a premium perk, so if you are looking for one, this is an option! One thing to also note is that ice boris will lose their color once pounded, and will change color to blue.</p>

<p><b>History</b>: Ice is water frozen in a solid state of matter. Due to hydrogen bonding within its molecular structure, water has a lower density compared to its liquid form. From a food perspective, ice is not only just used to cool things down, but it is also used to maintain perishable foods due to its low temperature and high moisture content to prevent products from drying out too quickly. 
<br>However, one thing to note is that ice crystallization during freezing can potentially affect food quality. This is because If ice crystals are too large in size, they have the potential to break up integral structures within a product such as a fruit or vegetable, and thus creating a mushier texture once consumed. This is a topic that food scientists are constantly studying, and figuring out better ways of freezing foods without sacrificing overall quality. </p>

<p><b>Food Science 101 - Hydrogen Bonding</b>: Hydrogen bonding is a very unique property for water. Water is made up of 2 hydrogen + 1 oxygen atoms. When water freezes, the molecules have a unique intermolecular interaction where hydrogens are sort of "rearranged" and form an attractive bond  (covalent) to a highly electronegative atom, which is oxygen in this case.  When multiple water molecules interact with each other in this fashion, it forms a hexagonal, lattice structure. Because the water molecules are not as tightly packed in its liquid state, this also explains why ice is more buoyant and generally lighter in density. Hydrogen bonding is also a unique property that allows water to stick on surfaces, dissolve other substances, etc. </p>

<br><p><b>Jelly</b> is a color that was released between 2005 and 2007 for both Neopets and PetPets. There are no paintbrushes for this color, and the only way it can be obtained is through the Lab Ray, premium perk, or a dip through the Fountain Faerie. As the name implies, every pet or petpet that is colored as jelly have a gelatinous like body and brightened up with vibrant colors, each possibly alluding to fruit flavors.</p>

<p><b>History</b>: Jellies are a clear dessert that are made up of gelatin. The word 'Jelly' originates from the French verb 'Geler' - meaning 'to gel'; while 'Gelatin' comes from the Latin word 'Gelatus', meaning 'jellied'. The earliest traces of Jellies were used in aspics in the 1600s - sometimes even savory food such as beef or vegetables could be combined with gelatin to be served for people to consume! Nowadays, we see jellies being used in sweet applications. In the United States, Jello is considered to be a staple food item, where gelatin powder is mixed with different flavors and bright colors to make a tasty dessert. Since gelatin technically comes from an animal, a plant alternative is <b>agar</b>; a jelly like substance from red algae.
<br> Jelly can refer to the fruit preserves or jams that we spread on our toast. Jams get their sticky, gel-like structure from <b>pectin</b> - a gelatinous molecule that is found in fruits and plants.</p>

<p><b>Food Science 101 - Gelatin</b>: Gelatin is a colorless and flavorless protein that is derived from <i>collagen</i>, a protein that is found in animals. Collagen molecules are fiber like in its natural state, and have to be converted into gelatin through heating (This step breaks down certain bonds in collagen allowing it to change into gelatin).
<br><br>Now that you know that fun fact, to get gelatin to form the jelly like structure that we all know, gelatin is dissolved with water and placed over a heat source, which causes the proteins to denature and unwrap itself. As the water and gelatin mixture (also known as a <i>solution</i>) is cooled down, the protein molecules start to interact with the water molecules via hydrogen bonding, thus forming the gel network and structure that most of us are familiar with today. We can also see gelatin being used in gummies, marshmallows, and other sweet desserts!</p>

<br><p><b>Strawberry</b> was first released as early as 2001 for the usul. It has expanded to other neopets and petpets since then, where the color dons a design similar to the fruit: A red base with light brown/yellow speckles, and additional green accents to resemble the stem and leafy portions of the fruit. This color can be obtained through the <i>Strawberry Fields Forever</i> paint brush, rainbow faerie fountain, lab ray, or premium perk. Chias can also obtain this color by consuming a <i>Magical Strawberry Chia Pop</i>.</p>

<p><b>History</b>: Strawberries are classified as <i>Fragaria chiloensis</i>. There are many subspecies of strawberries, but the plant is native to North and South American shores, and eventually brought over to Europe. This fruit is often recognized by its seeds being set on the outside of the body, rather than the inside. This is to also help with seed distribution whenever wild animals consumed the fruit.</p>

<p><b>Food Science 101 - Fruit Ripening</b>: Ripening is a process where fruits and vegetables start to break down over time, while also producing both favorable and undesirable characteristics; such as a sweeter tasting piece of fruit. This is typically triggered when a part of the plant is 'damaged' - in this case, when we tear a fruit or vegetable off of its native stem. In turn, it releases a compound called <i>Ethylene</i>, and triggers different enzymes to start breaking down cellular structure, sugars, and other molecules. This is why whenever we notice fruits or vegetables ripening, we notice that the color becomes darker (oxidation of chlorophyll and other color molecules), tastes different (Sweeter vs tart) or is more squishy in texture.</p>

<br><p><b>Water</b> was officially released as a paintbrush color on August of 2011. This color is available to both neopets and petpets and can be obtained through a paintbrush, lab ray, premium perk, morphing potion, or the rainbow pool. The color design can be described as blue with additional splashing and bubble-like textures.</p>

<p><b>History</b>: Water is a transparent chemical substance that is abundant throughout the world. It is vital for all forms of life and can has three unique states of matter: Solid (Ice), liquid, and gas (Water vapor). Water is present in many foods, and has many functional properties. Water serves as an important medium for many chemical reactions to take place, heat transfer, and its ability to hydrate and bind onto other molecules (Sidenote: This is also another unique attribute of hydrogen bonding as previously discussed). As an independent food, water provides no calories and is relatively odorless and tasteless in flavor.</p>

<p><b>Food Science 101 - Water Activity</b>: One of the very first things we are taught in food science is the concept of <b>water activity</b>, denoted by the symbol <b>a<sub>w</sub></b>. This is a ratio of the partial vapor pressure of water in a food divided by the standard state partial vapor pressure of water (pure water); or in more simple terms: <b>the amount of free water that is present within a food</b>. Water activity is typically calculated as a number between 0 and 1, and is often used as an indicator for a food's shelf life and potential microbial growth conditions.</p>

<p>Furthermore, water has a unique behavior where water molecules will generally migrate from areas of higher water activity to areas of lower water activity, This is often denoted as <i>moisture migration</i> and can potentially make certain foods too dry or soggy. Scientists often use this value to figure out what ingredients work best to prevent moisture migration in certain applications.</p>

<br><p><b>Ice</b> was released for the Bruce during Bruce Day on December 6th, 2004. This color is unique for this specific neopet in that it is supposed to resemble a popsicle (now as its unconverted form). Since the conversion, Ice bruces now resemble a partially melted ice cream.</p>

<p><b>History</b>: Like the name implies, ice cream is made up of cream, milk solids, sugar, and water churned under very cold temperatures. Nobody really knows who was the first person to invent this food, but this dessert can be traced back to 2 BC. Ice cream was typically consumed by the upper class, as it was technically considered to be a luxurious item. Over time, ice cream was introduced to the U.S. food industry in 1851 by Jacob Fussell and was made popular in the 19th century with ice cream parlors and advancements in industry.</p>

<p><b>Food Science 101 - Ice Cream Processing</b>: To make ice cream on an industrial level, cream, milk solids, sugar, and water are mixed together. Additional stabilizers (e.g. gums) and emulsifiers are also incorporated to help improve product texture and stability during processing and shelf life. The mixture then has to be pasteurized in order to remove any harmful bacteria that can grow in the product. The liquid cream mixture is then put through a homogenizer to break down the larger fat molecules from the cream/milk to a smaller size in order to help improve the physical characteristics of the product. After that step, the cream is then cooled down and aerated so it doesn't freeze too quickly.
<br><br>Flavors and toppings are usually mixed in before the final freezing step because if they were added before the pasteurization and homogenization stages, there's a risk for flavor degradation, and it can also affect any desirable qualities for the ice cream. Finally once that step is completed, the mixture can then be hardened and stored at even colder temperatures to finish the freezing stage.</p>

<br><p><b>Food Chias</b>: The chia is unique in that on top of the traditional food colors via paint brush, fountain faerie, etc., this Neopet species can actually transform into additional  fruit and vegetable based colors! These unique colors can be obtained at the Rainbow Fountain, Lab Ray, Premium Perk, and Magical Chia Pop. 

<br>Chias can transform into the following fruits/vegetables: Agueena, Apple, Asparagus, Aubergine, Avocado, Blueberry, Carrot, Chokato, Durian, Gooseberry, Gr-ape, Lemon, Lime, Onion_  Orange, Pea, Peach, Pear, Pepper, Pineapple, Plum, Strawberry, Thornberry, Tomato. </p>

<p><b>Food Science 101 - Vitamin C</b>: Many of the fruits that the Chia can take form of contains high sources of Vitamin C! Vitamin C is also known as <i>Ascorbic Acid</i>, and is considered to be a vital nutrient for our immune system. This was used to treat Scurvey back in the day and can also act as an antioxidant. Chemically, Vitamin C is one of the very few nutrients that quickly degrades when it is exposed to too much light or heat; so whenever food scientists and food engineers are working on a new product that contains vitamin C; it's something that we have to keep an eye out for and make sure we can don't lose too much vitamin C during the cooking and shelf life process.</p>

<p><b>History</b>: Marshmallows are a confectionary dessert that is made up of sugar, water, and gelatin. Air is introduced into the dessert, which is why there is a perceived airy texture whenever we bite into them. The name of the dessert comes from the plant <i>Althaea offinalis</i>, often called 'The Mallow Plant'. The Egyptians were the first to use the plant's sap and mixed it with honey, fruits, and nuts; which was often reserved for the royalty and upper class.
<br><br>The French then brought this plant to their candy stores during the 1800s and is reported to be the first to create the spongy-like dessert that we eat today. Marshmallows are commonly consumed with or as 'marshmallow fluff', sweet potatoes, hot chocolate, and S'mores: a dessert sandwich that uses graham cr-ackers, chocolate, and toasted marshmallows.</p>

<p><b>Food Science 101 - Maillard Reaction</b>: Have you noticed whenever you toast marshmallows, sear meat, or toast bread, that you notice dark brown colors after cooking? You may know this cooking step as browning, but what you may not know is that this is a specific chemical process called <i>Maillard Reaction</i>, which was first noted by Louis Camille Maillard. Chemist John Edward Hodge then went on to define a chemical mechanism for this unique reaction in 1953, naming it after Louis himself.<br><br>
To give a very brief and quick summary of what this reaction is, amino acids (From protein) and a reducing sugar (sugar that acts as a reducing agent... thus called a reducing sugar) react with one another with exposure to heat. The carbonyl group of the reducing sugar reacts with the amino group of the protein to produce a glycosamine moelcule. The glycosamine then rearranges itself several times (Known as Amadori arrangement) to produce a new moelcule called aminoketose. The aminoketose then goes through additional rearrangements and processing steps that creates the many browning or toasty like flavors that we notice in these foods.<br><br>

*NOTE: One thing to understand is that this reaction is NOT the same thing as <i>Caramelization</i>. The maillard reaction requires an amino acid to start the process and creates more in-depth flavor molecules; while caramelization is a completely different process where you ONLY expose sugar to heat, and it starts to develop brown pigments and a nutty like flavor.</p>

<br><p><b>JubJubs</b> also have two food colors that are unique to the species itself: specifically Coconut and Garlic. The coconut JubJub was released in 2003 and can be seen as both unconverted or converted; while the garlic JubJub was released in 2004. You can only obtain these colors through the Lab Ray, Premium Perk, or Rainbow Fountain. Another note is that if you feed a tropical food to a coconut jubjub, then you can unlock the Coconut JubJub avatar!</p>

<p><b>History - Coconut</b>: Coconuts (<i>Cocos nucifera</i>) is technically a fruit and thrives in both tropical and subtropical climates. This fruit is often used in many food applications ranging from desserts or even breading on seafood. Coconut also extracted for its oil and milk.</p>

<p><b>Food Science 101 - Coconut Oil</b>: Coconut oil is made up of 80-90% saturated fat and remains solid at room temperature. It is usually noted as a relatively flavorless oil To obtain this oil, the flesh of the coconut fruit is pressed to release the milk and oil. The oil is then separated from the milk through fermentation, centrifuges, or enzymes. If desired, the oil can then be further refined and filtered by removing any unwanted impurities. Coconut oil is relatively flavorless and has a very high smoke point, which doesn't make it useful for deep-frying food.</p>

<br><p><b>Kikos</b> also have two unique food colors to its species: Garlic and Chokato. Chokato was released in 2003, while garlic was released in 2004. Similar to the JubJub, the only way to obtain these colors are through the Lab Ray, Premium Perk, or Rainbow Fountain.</p>

<p><b>History</b>: Garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>) is a bulb plant that is related to chives, leeks, and onions_  It is often used as an herb in savory cooking all around the world, and produces a very pungent and slight sulfuric like flavors. Garlic has been around for centuries, and was reported to first originate in China. Garlic is also noted to have many health benefits and was used in medicinal applications.</p>

<p><b>Food Science 101 - Garlic</b>: Both garlic and onion contain allyl alcohol, diallyl disulfide, methyl allyl disulfide, and methyl allyl trisulfide. These molecules are unique to the plant and are the ones that contribute to its strong, unique flavor. There is also a unique enzyme within both plants called <b>Allinase</b>. When you look at an uncut bulb of onion or garlic, it doesn't produce a very strong odor. That's because the flavor molecules and the Allinase are trapped within the cell walls of the plant, thus being separated and not being able to interact with one another. However, the moment you chop into the clove of garlic, the cell walls are not only broken, but you also release the enzyme and flavor molecules; allowing them to interact with one another, and then creating the recognizable strong odors and unique flavors. </p>
