<br><br>In 2019, <b>Ask the PC</b> AKA PC Surveys returned for Round 3! The goal of PC Surveys was to collect, as objectively as possible, answers from regular PCers like you and tally up the answers to see what comes up top. After a month and a half of survey collecting and board bumping, the results are finally in!<br><br>The results are up in the form of graphs that show the top answers and <b>I will no longer be taking survey answers for this particular set.</b><br><br>Doing this project was a fair bit of work (mostly having to set up boards each day and bump them) but I'm personally satisfied with the result. <br><br>If you have any suggestions, questions, or comments, feel free to mail me with the link below:<br><br><br><br><center><a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=tiffywuvsq"><img src="//images.neopets.com/themes/016_blu_e56fc/events/neomail.png"><br><b>Send a mail!<b></b></b></a></center>

<br><br><div style="background-color: #3D3D3D; padding: 5px; font: 8pt Verdana; overflow: auto; height: 200px;"><h2>A few important disclaimers</h2>
<ul><li>The most important disclaimer, and I can't stress this enough, is that these top lists are restricted to the sample. That said, please do not take these results very seriously. I made steps to try and keep it as ideal as possible, but there are so many factors that were out of my control (lack of larger sample size, the ever present bias, etc.) that the results are not that representative of the real statistic. <b>This project was created mostly for entertainment purposes.</b> Please, please, please don't go around quoting me on this stuff.
</li>
<li>On top of that, the project is limited to collecting surveys within our waking hours and within the times we are available to bump the board. I was also not able to advertise every day. Due to this we have unfortunately had to exclude most of the "late night" population in this survey, although I did what I could to keep the board bumped throughout the day as much as possible.</li>
<li>There are some individual disclaimers and notes for each survey that will only pertain to that survey.</li>
<li>
<b>Each graph only includes the top few answers (the number that is shown varies per survey). That means that the answers that the graphs show are NOT ALL of the responses for that particular question.</b> Having to list all of them would make the graphs particularly lengthy and messy.
</li>
<li>I tried to keep the surveys as unbiased and objective as possible, but of course that's not possible with the nature of the survey collection. Since all answers should be by neomail, it reduces the occurrence of people peeking at the answers that other people submitted.</li>
<li>
Since I had some people ask, yes, I did answer these surveys and included my answers into the results, however I answered them <b>first</b> (as in, I put in my answers before I started collecting surveys from other PCers), so my answers were unbiased.</li>

</ul></div><br>
The questions and the specific response types that were requested are found below. The response form, which uses the shorthand/condensed names for each question, can be answered by neomail (although board ones are acceptable, neomail is highly preferred). I was only taking the first answers for the amount that I requested, and any extra would be excluded. I will only take the first three answers for the first question, for example, even if you answered more than three.<br><br><br><h2>2019 Survey Questions</h2><div style="background-color: #3D3D3D; padding: 5px; font: 7pt Verdana; overflow: auto; height: 300px;">

I am aware people shift interests often, so try and pick a few that you feel you've been a long-time fan of or will be a long-time fan of. <br><br>

	Post YOUR favorite Neopian character (must be an official Neopets character from TNT) from anywhere on the site, including but not limited to plots/wars/shops/Battledome/faeries/etc. This does not have to necessarily be a named character but the character must be distinguishable and unique. <br><br><h2>AC - Most Popular Altador Cup Team (1)</h2>

</p>
<ul><li>
<b>Friends</b> include friends, classmates, neighbors, friend's friends, etc., basically any referral that came from another pre-existing user outside of the Internet.</li>
<li>
<b>Family</b> is any referral that has something to do with a relative, so a referral from a relative's friend would be under this category.</li>
<li>
<b>Internet</b> refers to any referral from another site (or through surfing aimlessly).</li>
<li>
<b>Commercial</b> refers to any referral from any sort of ad that did not originate from the Internet (i.e. television, print).</li>
<li>
<b>McDonald's</b> refers to finding out about Neopets from the various McDonald's toy promotions.</li>
<li>
<b>Merchandise</b> refers to finding out about Neopets from Neopets merchandise (such as plushies).</li>

<br><br><hr><br><h2>2013 - Oldest Account Ages</h2>
<sub>The main disclaimer about this particular pair of surveys is that people (as well as I) tended to go off of userlookup shield rather than the account creation date, although many did provide the actual month age according to the boards. The spikes that you see are particularly the 12 month and 6 month factors, since I simply took the years or half years age that is provided on the shield (or the user) and converted it into months.</sub><br><br><i>Post the age (according to the Neoboards or userlookup shield, in months) of your oldest account that you still have access to.</i><br><br><center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/U0DgFKy.jpg" width="400"><br><br><b>Average:</b> 88.6 months<br><b>Standard Deviation:</b> 34.9 months<br><b>Median:</b> 89.5 months<br><b>Max:</b> 179 months<br><b>Min:</b> 8 months</center>
<br><br><hr><br><h2>2013 - Posted Account Ages</h2>
This was a "passive" survey, as I call it, because I simply took and wrote down the age of the account that a user is posting/neomailing from. This was to compare to whether users preferred to use their oldest account or newer accounts.<br><br><center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/2TcBuRj.jpg" width="400"><br><br><b>Average:</b> 72.7 months<br><b>Standard Deviation:</b> 37.6 months<br><b>Median:</b> 73 months<br><b>Max:</b> 179 months<br><b>Min:</b> 4 months</center>

</p><h2>I DID NOT CONDUCT THESE SURVEYS! I cannot verify all of the methods, but they've been included here for the curious :)</h2>
<br><br><h2><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Denic">Pops Or Nots? - Otto's UC Popularity Survey</a></h2>
<a href="//www.neopets.com/~Denic">This survey</a> was held in 2021 with a very interesting point system within each tier, having users submit their 3 favorite and 3 least favorite and adding and subtracting a starting point amount.


<br><br><hr><br><h2><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Largo">Katy's Surveys (Top Species &amp; More)</a></h2>
<a href="//www.neopets.com/~Largo">This project</a> began in 2019. <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=katy_n12">Katy's</a> initial method, for the very first question - What is the Most Popular Species? - involved polling the PC on several boards and counting yes/no's for listed species. The results for that survey, as well as possibly more in the future, can be found there!

<br><br><hr><br><h2><a href="//www.neopets.com/~DrownVictimOuchies">Unconverted Popularity Survey</a></h2><a href="//www.neopets.com/~DrownVictimOuchies">This project</a>, run in 2017, performed a very similar process to this page to collect data (mailing a form) but focused on <b>popular UCs solely by artwork</b>. It employs a very interesting rating system which is different from how I asked my question, so if you are interested in UCs, be sure to check the page out!
<br><br><hr><br><h2>(Announced) Player Ages</h2>
Ages are taken from posts on two different boards (one on Aug 16, 2017 and the other on Aug 31, 2017, different OP) asking for PCer ages. Keep in mind that it is only taking into account POSTED responses. There may be some overlap with users between the two boards (one user answering in both). With the data separated, there was no significant difference in ratios/means/etc. This graph is both boards combined.<br><br><b>Responses surveyed on this graph:</b> 99 (43 + 56)<br><br><center> 
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/G48Aqea.jpg" width="400"><br><br><b>Average:</b> 22.3 years<br><b>Standard Deviation:</b> 3.6 years<br><b>Median:</b> 22 years<br><b>Max:</b> 35 years<br><b>Min:</b> 15 years</center>

<h2>Special Thanks</h2></center>
I really want to extend my deepest thanks to everyone that took the time to answer the surveys, either in 2019, 2017, or 2013! I know your time is precious but this project truly would not have been possible without you all! Thank you for taking a moment to contribute to the survey.<br><br>I also would especially like to thank all of the users who stopped by my boards multiple times throughout the collection phases to chat or even help bump while I was gone, like Ag, Pixie, Zeldeh, Nikki, Val, Silver, Padfoot, Bitter, SNOWFLAKELE, McKenzie, the Broc squad (Rose, Kat, Al), and many more! I cannot begin to express how grateful I am to have your company and support!
