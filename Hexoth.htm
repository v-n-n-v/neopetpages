<h1>Burlap Buzz</h1>
<br><h2>a creepy lil' guy</h2>

<p>Welcome! My name is peitum (aka lollypopx2), and this is my proposal for the future burlap buzz, done in the original, creepier style!
</p><p>
Disclaimer: I'm not much of an artist, especially in the digital medium. I know little about colour levels or shading, and I'm working with a mouse and hereditary tremor. So please excuse the less-than-perfect linework.
</p>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zdmpaG9.png"></center>
<p>
My chief inspiration for this design were my two favourite burlaps from the original era: the quiggle and the ogrin. The fringe/comb is comprised of <b>assorted wires</b> (also found on the burlap lenny), and <b>fabric tears</b> are used to mimic the buzz's chin points and tail hairs. The wings are peppered with <b>moth holes</b> and other signs of wear and age.
</p><p>
Some other design elements that I think are important are: an <b>uneven fabric weave</b> (most prominent on the burlap quiggle) and a <b>darker colour scheme</b> of brown, with dark blue, black or silver details. The lack of patches or pale craft straw are also important aspects of the original style!
</p><p>
So, a bit of backstory as to why I care so much about this particular colour. I returned to neopets from a several-year hiatus in 2019, and one of the first things that I did after logging on was check out some of the stuff I missed, namely, all the new, cool colours. Among them was <b>burlap</b>. At the time, there were only three: the lenny, the quiggle, and the kiko.</p><p>
I fell in love with the colour. It was so <b>cursed</b>, so <b>creepy</b>, and spoke to my love of <b>haunted dolls</b>. The quiggle in particular was the epitome of what the colour was, and I really looked forward to seeing it released for my favourite species. But then the burlap meerca was released, marking what I see as the shift away from the 'original' style and towards the modern, cuter burlaps. The zafara followed, adding patches and beginning with the blumaroo, bright colours.
</p><p>
While the changes have been well-recieved, it is a depature from the style's roots. New burlaps are like old, but well-loved toys. Not a bad thing, but they're missing that vibe of a doll that you'd <b>throw in the trash</b> only to find it <b>sitting on your pillow</b> when you go to bed at night.
</p><p>
With the recent release of the burlap kyrii following in the more modern style, there are only two of my favourite species left: the vandagyre and the buzz. The latter probably has the best chance of making a return to the original spirit of the colour, as it's a species that is already considered a little more menacing than most!
</p><p>
