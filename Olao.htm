<b>What are screenies?</b><br></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">
A "Screenie" is basically a snapshot of a webpage. In the same way that cameras are used to capture <i>pictures</i> of real life, computers are used to capture <i>screenies</i> of neopian life. Screeniers are essentially the neopian equivalent to photographers!<br><br></font><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Who can make screenies?</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>Anyone can make screenies! I started when I was 11 years old!<br><br></font><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Where do I put my screenies?</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>Screenies are traditionally uploaded to a petpage<br><br></font><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Why make screenies?</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>Screenies are used as a form of entertainment. Some screeniers use their page simply to record their progress, but most screeniers focus on creating humor. 
<br>
Thousands and thousands of artists drew their initial inspiration from neopets screenies, myself included. It's incredibly fulfilling to receive mail from people telling me about how my screenies were able to brighten their bad day. The friends I made through screenies were the best I've had on neo. There are so many reasons to do it- a better question would be to ask <i>why NOT make screenies?</i><br><br></font><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>When should I take a screenshot?</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>Whenever something of significance happens. Random events, pound finds, big wins on dailies, and funny occurrences are some examples of what you might screenshot. <br><br><br></font>

Designing a character is a fun way to add some personality to your screenies, and to make your page more memorable. Most people use their Neopets as their characters, but others have used existing characters from Neopia (Example: Faeries) as well as those outside Neopia (ex:Spongebob).
<br><br><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>Nondrawn vs Drawn characters</b></font> <br>
Drawing your character gives you the most freedom, but if you are not interested in trying your hand at art, images can can be added to a screenie, like so:<br><br><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img922/4153/9K6f3O.png"><br><br> 
This section will focus on drawn characters, since adding existing images to a screenie is pretty straightforward.<br><br><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>Creating characters</b></font><br>You have complete freedom when designing your character, but these are some guidelines to help you get started or to make improvements on existing characters!<br><br><br><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img924/2306/1fRvvy.png"><br>In a <b>paper doll</b> character design,  the torso and limbs are blob shaped and can vary in length or size. This type of character design is a good choice for experienced artists because it demonstrates artistic ability while retaining the cartoonish quality that allows for fun reactions and exaggerations. Ex:1 also demonstrates a simple coloring and shading method called <b>cell shading</b> that is quick and doesn't overwhelming to the viewer (ideal for screenies.)
<br><br><br><br><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img923/5250/0bvIyc.png"><br> A <b>pillowcase</b> design is a head with a squarish body attached. The edges of the body can be rounded to make the body seem more like a blob. Limbs are optional, and usually are not included unless the character is using their hands for something. This type of design is ideal for beginners or artists who don't use drawing tablets, and the result usually looks geometric. Ex:2 involves a type of coloring called <b>picture filling</b> in which a texture from an existing picture (in this case a strawberry) is used as the fill. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img922/5377/sPFrfq.png"><br>An <b>anthro</b> character design traditionally describes a mix between human and animal characteristics. Because most screenie characters act and move like humans, anthro screenie characters are known for their exaggerated animal features (large snouts, paws, beaks, etc). The coloring in Ex 3 is <b>hatch shading</b> in <b>layers</b>.<br><br><br><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img924/3517/z66o2t.png"><br>A <b>quad</b> character stands on four legs! Screeniers don't always draw the entire body of the pet in the frame for the picture. Some advanced artists or people who draw in a <i>realistic</i> style prefer this method. The shading in this example is cell shading and <b>airbrushing</b>.<br><br><br><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>Customization</b></font><br><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img923/8762/e6ePpq.png"><br> Another important aspect of character design is originality. In the same way that you can customize your neopet with clothes, you can customize your screenie character with accessories, designs, or exaggerated features. It's important not to go overboard though, or your character will look tacky. 
</font>
<br><br><font face="verdana" size="6"><b><h3><a name="C"></a>-Community-</h3></b></font> <font size="2" face="Verdana">The screenie community is a group of vibrant individuals who each have a unique personality. Despite the diversity of it's members, the community as a whole focuses on enforcing the same set of values: <b>offering and accepting help and constructive criticism when appropriate, encouraging others, and preserving an environment of honesty and friendship.</b><br><br>
There are many ways to find other screeniers:<br>Make a thread on the neoboards! Join a screenie guild! Look at screenier's Affies!
<br><br><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>Affies</b></font> <font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>Affies are graphics/buttons that link to other screenie pages and are placed near the bottom of your screenie page. If another screenier says "wanna be affies?", they're suggesting "I'll put the link to your screenies on my page if you put the link to my screenies on your page". It's generally a good idea to be affies with other people, because viewers who liked looking through someone else's screenies will see your link on their page and click it. It's basically free advertising, and it helps viewers find other screenie pages to enjoy. You don't need permission to put someone else's affie button at the bottom of your page. 

<br><br><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>Awards</b></font> <font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>An award is a picture/graphic that someone might offer you if your screenie page impresses them. Everyone has their own criteria for determining what deserves an award, so don't be upset if you don't get one that you want. Awards are normally placed in their own section at the bottom of a screenie page. Don't take an award widthout permission- that would be rude. Not all screeniers choose to display their awards, but the honor of being offered one is always appreciated!


</font>
<br><br><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>Fanmail</b></font> <font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>Receiving, reading, and responding to fanmail is a big part of being a screenier. Sometimes fans will send you a kind neomail, other times they may send you an item. Some screeniers choose to include screenshots of these on their pages, while others do not. It is always appropriate to thank viewers for their praise. 
</font>
<br><br><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>Guest apperances</b></font> <font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>If your character becomes popular, another screenier might ask if they can have it do a "guest appearance" on their page. This just involves them using your character in one of your screenies. They should give you credit for the character by saying something like "CHARACTER is from YOURNAME's screenie page- go check it out!" either on or right below the screenie. This, like affies, is pretty much free advertising for you. </font>
<br><br><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>Privacy</b></font> <font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>Always ask permission to include someone's username in a screenie before posting it. If you do not wish to ask for permission, or if the individual does not give you permission to include their name, block or blur out the name so that the user is not identifiable. You'll most commonly block out usernames, pet names, and petpage links. </font><font face="verdana" size="6"><h3><a name="DASP"></a><b>-Designing a Screenie page-</b></h3></font> <font size="2" face="Verdana"> A screenie page can be thought of metaphorically as a Sandwich <br>(well, kind of. Mostly I'm just hungry while writing this). <br>Here's a visual, followed by a written explanation:<br><br><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img922/6603/itDHmc.png"></font>
<br><br><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>Header</b></font> <font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>A header is basically a title page for your screenie. Lots of people draw an image which usually features their characters and displays the title of the page: something like " foxity's SCREENIES!". This is the first impression that people get when they come to your page. If you have a nice layout and header, then your viewer will instantly be impressed and excited to read your screenies! </font>

<br><br><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>Info/Updates</b></font> <font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>In the same way that there are lots of different cheeses you can use to compliment your sandwich, there are a variety of ways to use the "info" section to introduce your screenies. This section usually comes before your screenies, and can inform the viewer about recent updates, welcome fans by inviting them to reach out with any feedback, and/or answer FAQ about characters, art programs, preferences, etc. You can do whatever you'd like with this section, or leave it out all together. However- it can be a good way to bridge the connections with fans so that they feel comfortable reaching out to you. </font>

<br><br><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>Screenies</b></font> <font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>Screenies are the main element of your page: it's what people are there for. Having quality, trimmed screenies is necessary to having a good screenie page. Add a bit of flavor to your screenies with humor, characters, or impressive accomplishments.  </font>

<br><br><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>Affies</b></font> <font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>Affies are like the lettuce of the sandwich because although they're not necessary, they make the sandwich tastier and fresher. Your affie section usually comes once your screenies are finished.</font>

<br><br><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>Trophies/Awards</b></font> <font size="2" face="Verdana"><br> Trophies (the tomatoes) are like affies in that they are not required for a good sandwich, but are generally a good idea in order to improve the dimension of the flavor of your page.</font>

<br><br><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>Link Backs</b></font> <font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>At the very end of your page, you should have a section for link back buttons- graphics that link back to your screenie page followed by text boxes with the codes for these buttons so that fans and other screeniers can link to your screenie page via their shops/ULs/petpages. </font>
<br><br><br><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>However, Unlike a sandwich....</b></font> <font size="2" face="Verdana"><br> the ingredients can technically be mixed up however you'd like. Most viewers prefer the sandwich layout, but It's ultimately your page and your decision. You can have your link back at the very top, then header, then affies, then an info section about updates, then screenies, then trophies, then a FAQ. In sandwich form, that'd look like bun, bun, lettuce, cheese, meat, tomato, cheese - but it could look totally fine in screenie page form. Just because the sandwich layout is <i>suggested</i> doesn't mean it's <i>required. </i></font>
<br><br><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>PS: A note on aesthetics</b></font> <font size="2" face="Verdana"><br><br>This applies to any page that you may create, but it is important to choose your colors and fonts wisely.<br>A detailed, fancy font is appropriate for a title, but not for a whole sentence.<br><br><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img922/4757/akeO8X.png"><br><br><br> Colors are similar in that you want to stick mostly to somewhat faded colors rather than extremely saturated colors. This is easier on the reader's eyes.<br><br><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img924/2159/PxLxdY.jpg"></font>


<br><br><font face="verdana" size="6"><b><h3><a name="O"></a>-Other-</h3></b></font> <font size="3" face="Verdana"> <b>Theft</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br><b>Don't steal from other people!!!!</b><br><i>This applies to tracing or ripping off art AS WELL AS stealing unique and original jokes.</i>
<br>

Some jokes are just overdone- nearly every page has some kind of joke about the tooth fairy forcibly exchanging a handful of neopoints for some poor neopet's tooth. That is because many people happened to have the same idea about an event. Good screenie pages have mostly unique jokes, so try to come up with something that makes your page different from the others!<br>

If you are wondering if someone has stolen your joke, idea, or artwork- it's a good idea to ask a few people in the community if they agree before leading an all out attack on the accused.<br><br><b></b></font>


<font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Restoration</b><br></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">

Since the 3rd party image hosting site known as photobucket stopped hosting free images, MANY of the screenie pages in existence have ceased to be. However, photobucket is not the only image hosting website.<br>

Others include : Imageshack, Cubeupload, TinyPic, Flickr, and VGY<br>

It took me around 1 hour to re-upload my screenies on a different site and post them again, so it is not a big commitment to repair an old screenie page!



</font><font size="3" face="Verdana"><br><br><b>Linkback</b><br></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">

It is my goal to restore screenies to what they once were- and with your help, it's possible!<br>

Post this button on your UL, shop, or petpage to direct others who may be interested in making screenies to this tutorial!
