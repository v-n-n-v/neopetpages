Hello there! My name is Veronica aka <a href="//www.neopets.com/randomfriend.phtml?user=lost_penelope">lost_penelope</a> and I've decided to host a list of available pet names I've come across in my adventures as an English major. <p>Note, I am no longer an English major, but I now have a BA in English Lit/Language (plus Gender Studies). What do I? I'm a Quality Engineer for toys. IDK, it was the recession and this is where I ended up. 

</p><p>I have not read all of these works (although some I have). So do not take me as the ultimate authority on what all the names mean. When I can I will try to put in info about the name. Oftentimes, the older works will have the same name spelled differently throughout the same work. When this happens, I put up the multiple spellings to provide more options for you!

</p><p>I order these names according to where I have found them. Thus all the names found in <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> will be grouped together. I have also tried to put them in chronological order, but this is not 100%.

</p><p>I remove all of the taken names, although I no longer list them on this site. For the first week or so I'll just strike it through so I can keep track of it.<br><br><b>Comments/Questions?</b>: Please neomail me <a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=lost_penelope">here</a> on my main!<br><br></p></font><font face="verdana" size="2" color="black"><div align="left">


<b>Middle English:</b><br><br><i>The Canterbury Tales</i><br><br><i>The Faerie Queene</i> (The Faerie Queene could be Early Modern English, but Spenser goes out of his way to use archaic words so he'd be happy in Middle English)
