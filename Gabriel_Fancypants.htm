<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
Why hello there, fictomaestro! My name is Gabriel, a humble Shoyru living my best life on Mystery Island. Please do enjoy your stay!

<br><br><h1 id="about">About This Page</h1>
Oh, I should mention that this page is dedicated to the study of Neopia's unique foods and their properties! Windstar has been very curious about them for a while, and I'm honored to help her by listing them here, of course! It's clever, really, she not only reviews the description of the food itself, but the other dishes that said food is used in- in order to come up with a more conclusive description... She may take a description request if you ask nicely!

<br><br><i>Thornberry, being the ever-sweet and ever-juicy fruit that it is, is used in a wide array of Candies, Desserts, and Brews alike... making it ever so apparent that Neopia can and WILL fight the thorns of this fruit just to eat it! The thorns are annoying at best and not super sharp, but will still get the better of one if they're not careful. Other observed uses include pasta dishes, as well as being paired with Lemon Flavored items!</i>
