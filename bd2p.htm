<b>4.25.2020</b>
<p> L54 9iSolation is less than a week out! And League 54 is more active than its ever been in the last 5 and half years. The <a href="//www.neopets.com/~LordGlob">9iSolation</a> tour is going to be the biggest in L54 history, and possibly the greatest. But L54 isn't the only league making noise right now, DDL is picking up interest with several people training up for the new Lite build already! And TPL is aiming to get in the mix as well. Truly some exciting times for 2P battledome!
</p>


<b>4.22.2020</b>
<p> Drizzle has been banned from the 9i format of League 54 and IDB Admin, Macosten, has updated the official rules on jellyneo. The vote to ban it was nearly unanimous for reasons like minimizing glitches, unblockable icons, and it being OP when it works properly. This is a great change for a league that is already super popular.</p>

<b>4.14.2020</b>
<p> Its time for another League 54 Tour. Sign ups kicked off today for <a href="//www.neopets.com/~LordGlob">9iSolation</a>. The event is being hosted by Demiglob and is starting on May 1st. It will be a best of three, double elimination tournament featuring the 9i variant of L54. Should be an awesome event with many participants!
</p>


<b>4.10.2020</b>
<p> DDL has some exciting updates for those interested in faster training. <a href="//www.neopets.com/~dragons_lord">DDL Lite</a> is a brand new build that cuts training time by 40-75% and also saves on cost. DDL Standard and DDL Lite will use the same rules just different builds. Blaze has also been added into league at 3 points.
</p>

<b>2.29.2020</b>
<p> Last day of February. Which means a fresh <a href="//www.neopets.com/~L54Showdown">Monthly Leaderboard</a> will start tomorrow. This was one of the most active months for 9i so far. Over two dozen 9i battlers have thrown down this year on hundreds of battles! Get ready for a big March and a new <a href="//www.neopets.com/~L54Showdown">Top 10</a>.
</p>



<b>2.18.2020</b>
<p> The <a href="//www.neopets.com/~FatShoyru">Raid Boss Challenge</a> officially began today after the Khonzu Buff vote was finalized. A majority of the participants voted for <a href="//www.neopets.com/~FatShoyru#khonzu">Grenya's Favor</a>. The event has a plot feel to it and features a one-vs-all style of battling. It is likely to last a few months with over 100 battles. Good luck to the challengers!


</p>


<b>2.1.2020</b>
<p> Freezesareop came out on top again in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/~L54Showdown">January Leaderboard </a>. Not far behind him was Prenade, with an impressive 22 wins. A significant improvement made by this L54 prospect. Benarra had a strong performance as well. He is bringing home another Monthly Top 3 Trophy. Big Congrats to everyone in the Top 10 and great job all battlers out there! 
</p>

<b>1.11.2020</b>
<p> <a href="//www.neopets.com/~9icon">9i</a> had a super active December and momentum is carrying into 2020. Trophies were made by Discoleon and awarded to the top three overall battlers for last month. The <a href="//www.neopets.com/~L54Showdown">December Top 10</a> can be found right on the scoreboard.

</p>

<b>12.17.2019</b>
<p> <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Fishbea">Battle Highlights</a> can now be found here on BD2P. Screens from the monthly battle boards are up and more will be added. They include everything from post battle reactions to strategy to other exciting outbursts.
</p>

<b>12.13.2019</b>
<p> The <a href="//www.neopets.com/~9icon">9i Rules</a> can now be found on one page. The formatting and wording will be enhanced soon. If you have further questions about the 9i rules reach out to fishmas or IDB Admin, Macosten.
</p>

<b>12.11.2019</b>
<p> Battle Battle Battle! There was a dozen 9i matches today on the December Battle Board. Making today the most active day of the month so far. Several new battlers were hopping into the mix as well. 9i appears to still be the dominant league that will stick around for a while.
</p>


<b>12.08.2019</b>
<p> Competition is picking up! Lets keep score. The brand new <a href="//www.neopets.com/~L54Showdown">L54 Scoreboard</a> is live! Formatting and updates are on the way but all the scores starting from December 1st are being recorded. Expect stats, trophies and more exciting features to be added in the very near future!
</p>

<b>11.15.2019</b>
<p> The predominant 2P League known as  <a href="//www.neopets.com/~SteadyHand">L54 9i</a> has been picking up interest lately. It's a newer format that features the popular League 54 build. The major rule changes from original L54 are limiting constants to 9 icon max, banning the use of frozen combo and getting rid of meditate. There is an open battle board going now and spare pets up for adoption!
</p>

<b>11.1.2018</b>
<p> The popular <a href="//www.neopets.com/~rhinosayan">L54 Battle Board</a> hosted by western_force is back in full force. This activity helped bring League 54 to the forefront in 2017 and 2018. There are several new battlers in the mix and lots of fun going on. Check out the battledome board to hop on in.
</p>

<b>7.7.2018</b>
<p> MBL Tour Kicking Off Today! This is event #4 for the league that was created by drazu. And the roster list is STACKED! Thank you to the host, Alex, for kicking off the event right at midnight today. The bracket and rules can all be found on the 
 <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Vynett">Offical MBL Page.</a> Good luck to everyone in the tournament!
</p>

<b>7.5.2018</b>
<p> A few issues reported related to battledome. The first is that the healing spring is not showing items for sale for many users. And there was also issues signing up for obelisk war. Perhaps these are signs of TNT @ work.
</p>

<b>6.1.2018</b>
<p> The Nubs guild launched today. It has quickly become the largest guild army on neopets. The guild was founded by BD2P's own Fishmas. The Nubs is already the most active guild on neopets and a great place to learn 2P.
</p>

<b>4.6.2018</b>
<p> TPL Rise to Power the first tournament on the Spanish Forums with 20 battlers in over 7 years. There was 20 signups in the first 24 hours. It is being run by BD2P host, fishmas. 
</p>

<b>4.1.2018</b>
<p> BD2P went down for April Fools and fish announced he was retiring (as a joke). Several were fooled. Neopets announced a theme park in Asia that tricked many as well.
</p>

<b>3.27.2018</b>
<p> Players excited to battle as the lag clears up. Fights in both MBL and L54 today. Still no prize shop for charity corner. In the neo news they announced that will be delayed.

</p>

<b>3.26.2018</b>
<p> The Neo Pet Image Crisis ended late in the night. Starting around 7:30PM neo began adding pet images one by one. The site went into massive lag throughout the late hours of the nice. Most of the pet images are returning now.
</p>

<b>3.25.2018</b>
<p> Hamsterpellet stopped by the L54 King of The Board to say hi and let the battlers know he will fight again when he has time. Nice to see an old school L54er who still loves to battle.
</p>

<b>3.23.2018</b>
<p> L54 Showdown and L97 Resurrection Tours are wrapping up. Showdown down to 6 battlers and Resurrection down to the final 4. Great tournaments so far.
</p>

<b>3.21.2018</b>
<p> Neoskulltula was reinstated and made an appearance on the Battledome board today. He is the creator of L97 and TPL. A warm welcome back to a great 2P battler who has made a large contribution to league history.
</p>

<b>3.12.2018</b>
<p> Charity Corner is a bit different this year. No r99 prizes or any prizes whatsoever. Instead there are points that will go toward perks. The event lasts 11 days and is creating a lot of lag. Can players can donate anything except r180. Hopefully this doesn't cause too many problems for battling.
</p>


<b>
3.01.2018 </b> <p></p>
L97 will be banning both GC and DFC after L97 Resurrection. The biggest reason being due to stalling/turn order glitch. And also DFC being a bit overpowered in the league.
<p></p>

<b>2.23.2018</b>
<p> L54 Showdown Kicked off today. There are 26 participants making this tournament the largest in L54 history. Showdown will be a single elimination best of three format. It features many great battlers including four champions. Good luck all participants!
</p>

<b>2.14.2018</b>
<p> Battledome survey ended in just three days. Lets hope that TNT plans to act as fast on fixing everything as they did on polling the battlers. L97 Resurrection is underway and several matches have already gone down!
</p>


<b>2.12.2018</b>
<p> BATTLEDOME SURVEY IS OUT. Check out the battledome or the news. There are links to the survey. It covers a lot of important issues like HP increase, high score tables, and fixing glitches. Make sure to support the BD
</p>


<b>2.9.2018</b>
<p> L97 Resurrection Tournament started today! The bracket will be updated as results come in. Look for the official tournament board. Good luck participants.</p><p></p>


<b>2.7.2018</b>
<p> Abgbukhnad won the first tournament of 2018. He got victory in DDL. That makes him the current champion of both L54 and DDL. He beat nubleticed in the finals after facing pisha1 who took third place. Great tournament. And now L97 Resurrection is just days away!
</p>


<b>2.6.2018</b>
<p> Two new battledome weapons appeared in the hidden tower today. Focus of Imminent Destruction does 35 icons when it attacks. It appears to hit around 70% of the time but has a cool down period and some odd effects. The Gemmed Sword of Light does 16 constant icons. Lord Darigan Plushie and Jhudora's Bewitched Ring were also both retired.
</p>

<b>1.26.2018</b>
<p> A huge victory for all battledomers today! Neo announced in the recent editorial that fixing the battledome is at the top of their priorities. Hopefully glitches that impact 2P will be fixed very soon!

<b>1.20.2018</b>
<p> DDL Tournament kicking off today. There's several formidable battlers in the mix. L54 tournament sign-ups are also underway, already 18 interested! That will be starting up on February 23rd.
</p>

<b>1.12.2018</b>
<p> TPL Tournament was announced today. So far a few people have already signed up. The tournament will be named Rise to Power. This is the third TPL Tournament. 
</p>

<b>1.6.2018</b>
<p> Neo ended their gift of NC at midnight, prizes have yet to be received. BD2P reaches 1000 views. Lots of L97 battling today as well. And the Resurrection Tournament is looking like double digits in terms of participants. Don't forget about the DDL tournament - that's just two weeks away. 
</p>


<b>1.5.2018</b>
<p> TGIF! A few updates from two leagues. L97 announcing the date for the Resurrection Tournament. That will be February 9th 2018. And DDL making a few point changes before their tournament on January 9th 2018. Both tournaments are taking sign ups! Check out L97 and DDL today
</p>
<p>


<b>1.4.2018</b>
</p><p> What a great day to be an L54er. We saw dozens of battlers on the L54 Battle Board. 14 hours of straight brawl from 10am until 11:59PM. It was wild. There were times when multi-matches were being fought L54 remains the top league in terms of active battles. 
</p>
<p>
<b>1.3.2018</b>
</p><p> Neopets was down for around 4-6 hours today. Hopefully you had time to get your battles and dailies in before that. One battledome fight in L54 took an entire 6 hours. Epi commenting that it was the longest it ever took him to beat a challenger. Good news however, is the site is back up and running. Hopefully they were fixing the BD while it was down. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
<b>1.2.2018</b>
</p><p> The current champion of L54, Epi, and the champion of L97, Bill, both make appearances today. They fight some of the best competition so far in 2018. Also happening today, Fish fights his debut 2P battle against bossgdon in TPL. We have the results and more! Check out all the match highlights.  
</p>

<b>12.31.2017</b>
<p> Last day of Battling for Decembers Battle Board for L54. It resets at Midnight tonight. The board will be reset for January and December trophies and scrolls will be awarded. We tested the skirmish feature in 2 player battling. You can click on the grey picture, but it doesn't match up battles. Five of us waited for several minutes with no success
</p>

<b>12.30.2017</b>
<p> Brand New: Price Check, Live Coverage and Match Highlights. Also look for some increased L54, TPL and L97 action on the boards! 
</p>

<b>12.29.2017</b>
<p> Good news for those who also do 1P. After 4 days of glitches it appears the battledome is dropping prizes again. Go collect your nerkmids and codestones. Dont forget to use the proceeds for your 2p training and set upgrades!  <br><br><b>

<b>12.26.2017</b>
</b></p><p> There was a Pedro (hamsterpellet) sighting on the BD. And updates were made to /~League54 page for the first time in a while. Check out the petpage and expect another L54 tournament in the near future!
</p><p></p>


<b>12.22.2017</b>
<p>Tiny Pet League has been revamped. The build used to be 12hp but has been increased to 15hp to avoid battles ending in two rounds. So far the results are good.

<h1>10) FAQs</h1>
<center> 
<p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/images/petcentral/faq.gif" border="0"></p>

<b>I want to do 2P in 2020 what are my options?</b><p>I highly recommend training for the League 54 build and playing the 9i variant. Other suggestions would be DDL, TPL, L97 and MBL.</p>

<b>What happened to the old leagues like L2-L24?</b><p>When the new battledome was made the old leagues no longer functioned properly due to the change in faerie abilities. Defense had to be shifted to weapons and pet builds. L97 was the pioneer. It 
was built around icicle and became a catalyst for the new leagues.</p>

<b>How do I join a league?</b><p>All you need to do is have a properly trained pet for the league. Follow the required stats and get legal weapons to battle with </p>

<b>What exactly is a league?</b><p>A league is a way to battle for 2P on neopets. There are agreed upon rules and pet builds but lots of room for strategy and creativity. </p>

<b>What are the best leagues for a beginner or someone with a low budget?</b><p>TPL is the easiest league to train for and many of the weapons are cheap buyables. L54 is also beginner friendly with a bit more training involved. 9i is a version of L54 that is very popular and budget friendly.</p>

<b>How can I get on the Battlers Directory?</b><p>Mail fishmas if you would like to be on the list of L54/9i battlers. </p>

<b>Do people battle outside of leagues for 2P</b><p>Very rarely. The leagues are designed to work out some kinks in the system and create the most competitive battling atmospheres </p>


<b>How do I find someone to battle with?</b><p>Just make a board in the battledome chat saying you are seeking challenges, the name of your pet and the league! Or you can find a pre-existing battle board and join in or ask any questions there. </p>


<b>I saw the weapon prices section. Can you tell me what xyz is worth?</b><p>Mail fishmas if you are trying to get a price check. I will consult others to find prices for item not listed in JN database history etc. </p>

I think a lot of people get discouraged when they start falling behind or they panic and get desperate and start making bad moves because they're trying to close the gap. I just take a deep breath and focus on the battle. I don't let the point gap distract me ~

We have all had moments of inspiration. I know for me it was during the TOW (Tale of Woe) Plot. I was new to the site &amp; had a limited budget. I could not beat the shrieking shadow. I started training and bought a few new weapons, by the end of the plot had his stats to 50/50/50. I finally beat him just once, I felt such a sense of accomplishment ~ crystallee723

The battledome is the place where you constantly reset goals - be it building your pet, buying another shiny weapon, or trying new strategies - all in an effort to beat your opponent - and the best part - no two people are the same, we all have different ways to achieve the outcome.  ~ chris219

<b>Getting an L54 Pet:</b><p></p>
Step one is to get an L54 pet. You want a pet with: 54hp / 13-19 strength / 35-54 defense. You can train your own pet from scratch, adopt an L54 pet or adopt a pet close to league stats and finish training, or you can borrow a pet from someone.

There is a few things to consider before training a pet. The most important of which is to not go over any of the stat limits. There is some leeway room for defense and strength as you can be anywhere within the allowed boosts (13 strength boost, 35 defense boost). HP is going to be your biggest concern. You want to have a plan for that. If you are using faerie cookies to train consider saving a dark faerie quest and using it at 51hp. You can also save a pink birthday cupcake and use it at 49hp. Faerie Queen Neggs are a pricey way to get 1hp you could use that at 53hp. You can try various other methods or just gamble gamble that you don't get a training bonus. 
<p></p>
<b>L54 Pet Adoption:</b><p></p>
If you want to try adopting a pet first look at BD2P section for BD pet adoption. You can also search the pound yourself or make a board on the battledome chat or even the pound chat. Occasionally people post boards on the battledome chat about adopting out league pets some keep and eye out for those.<p></p>

<h1>L54 Weapons</h1><p></p>
<b>Building Your Arsenal:</b><p></p>
You want a well rounded set with many options and variations. You want to get several constants, shields and dual duties. Reflectors are a bit more risky but you can look into those as well. It's good to have enough weapons that you can build different sets and change out weapons between battles to keep your opponents guessing<p></p>
<b>Setting Up To Battle:</b><p></p>
When you battle an unknown opponent make sure you build your set to be able to attack with various icon spreads. Most of the time you will want to use many Dual Duties that both attack and defend. When you select what weapons to use try to stack various icon spreads or block specific combos. Think about what weapons work well together. Also consider there are 7 different icon types.  You should aim to have a counter for most of them unless you are taking a more aggressive strategy. <p></p>
<b>Battling Known Opponents:</b><p></p>
When you battle an opponent you should try to remember what weapons they use. If you are really serious you can even take notes during the battle. Having this history might help you be better prepared for the next time you fight. You can try to come up with new counters and adjust your set.
<h1>L54 Strategy</h1><p></p>
<b>
Using Constants:</b><p></p>
Deciding how many constants to use depends on the rest of your set and your overall strategy. More constants means more aggression. But remember the defense boost in L54 is 1.5x strength. This can be a deterrent from getting too aggressive. In general most constants do best in 2. However many constants pair well a dual duty or shield as well. For example: maractite duck + frozen water daggers 
<b></b><p></p><b>
Using and Countering Dark:</b><p></p>
Dark is particularly harder to block than other icons due to shade not blocking it. Try using a shield or a Dual Duty for dark defense. For strategy you could attempt to play dark on turns you think your opponent will use shade. For example: wraith scroll x2
<p></p><b>
Using and Countering Frozen Combo:</b><p></p>
Frozen Combo is one of the signature moves in L54. It is the frozen water daggers combined with the frozen wave scimitar. Given the defense boost 1.5x in this league this combo hits hard both offensively and defensively. One bit of advice is to make sure you have a move that can counter Frozen Combo in case your opponent is using it. For example: wheel shield + fiery battle duck 
<p></p>
<b>Using Dual Duties:</b><p></p>
Dual Duties truly shine in this league. You can use Dual Duties with other DDs, with shields, or with constants. Try to stack various icon spreads and attack the icons your opponent is likely to use. You want plenty of Dual Duties in your set. For example: twisted dark dagger
<p></p>
<b>Earth and Light Icons:</b><p></p>
The abilities halitosis and static cling are both pretty popular in this league. So consider have weapons that block earth and light or both. Also be careful not to use too much of either of these icons. If your opponent is using an ability consider blocking that icon type as it is more easily predicted. You might want to bring a weapon that blocks both light and earth. For example: deadly pugio<p></p>
<b>The Battle Ducks</b><p></p>
Icy Battle Duck can pair with frozen water daggers to beat the frozen combo heads up. It is a mid grade level constant and can be strong if used correctly<p></p>
Fiery Battle is another mid grade constant. The only danger with using this weapon is that the popular twisted dark dagger can shut it down pretty hard. Have a plan for that<p></p>
Maractite Battle Duck is an upper grade constant. It plays well with other water icons especially another Maractite Duck. It can also be used with Frozen Water Daggers or Frozen Wave Scimitar. And like all the ducks can be played with a shield or healer.<p></p><b>Species Weapons</b><p></p>
The most likely species weapons you will face are the Silver Korbat Amulet from korbat opponents and the Kayla's Cloak from zafara opponents. Be ready for those weapons. Also don't be surprised if your opponent chooses not to use them at all. The cloak shuts down frozen combo quite well especially if used with static cling. The Silver Korbat Amulet combines 3 hard to block dark icons with 3 hard to block fire icons while blocking both earth and light itself. Its a tricky weapon but when used effectively it can be powerful.<p></p>
<b>Using and Playing Vs Meditate</b><p></p>
Shade is a bit more popular than Meditate due to it being more reliable. However you should be ready to both use and play vs meditate. For this ability to work you must act before your opponent. It helps to plan ahead for possible moves you could do and it helps to try to go a bit faster than you normally would. When playing vs meditate don't panic. Try to select the best move and hopefully also act first. When used perfectly meditate heals 4hp two rounds in a row.
