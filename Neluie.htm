Hi I'm Becca, and welcome to the character page for my gnorbu herd!<br><br><br>
It's always been my dream to have all 51 painted colors in my herd...<br>
...and now I finally do!<br><br>
My herd was completed on <b>March 29, 2022</b>!
<br><br>
The last member to join was Chubisc the spotted gnorbu,<br>
who was gifted to me by a wonderfully kind neopian!
<br><br><br><b>update:</b> after the release of the Toy color on 1/6/23, <br>I adopted Piasy on 1/11/23 by another wonderfully kind neopian!

<h2>Pastry Baker</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
Roycio, or Royce as his friends call him, is a faerie born from wishes made on birthday candles. He is a perpetual sweetheart that can be a bit shy and soft-spoken at first. With just a few smiles though, he will be your friend for life.
<br><br>
Royce runs a bakery called Love At First Bite. He is the head baker, decorator, and mastermind behind each delicious recipe. Although, he does not have a head for business, so he leaves all the confusing logistics to Eiloh - his best friend.
<br><br>
His friend Eiloh runs the store front, while Floury - a tiny fae that came to life from a bag of flour - assists in the kitchen. His doglefox, Streusel, is often seen napping in the storefront window and will gladly accept belly rubs from customers.

<h2>Barista</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
Eiloh is the rational minded half of Love at First Bite. While Roycio is the mastermind delicatessen behind the bakery - Eiloh is the one that keeps the doors open. When he isn't busy reigning in Roycio's crazy ideas, he works as a cashier and barista in the bakery with Meugi. While he became a barista out of necessity when the bakery was at its beginning, he has learned to love the craft. He still prefers tea to coffee however, and even makes his own tea blends. Just ask him for a sample next time you stop by!
<br><br>
Zinnia, Eiloh's faellie, has taken up residency within one of the hydrangea bushes and is known to braid flower crowns for her favorite regulars.

<h2>Gardener</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
Meugi's day job is cashier at Love at First Bite, but his real passion is in gardening. When he was first hired, the patio behind the bakery was a sad plot. Now it is a stunning, flourishing garden thanks to Meugi, and one of the many reasons why patrons return to Love At First Bite. 
One day, Meugi hopes to open his own landscaping business.

<h2>Sweet Tooth</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
As one of the best confectioners around, Popswirl is a bit of a culinary celebrity. He's won many awards and competitions - some of these competitions have even been televised. His perfectly coiffed hair and adorable demeanor has garnered him a small fan base.
<br><br>
Popswirl takes sugar confectionery very seriously - he even went as far as studying chemistry to bring molecular gastronomy into the world of candy making. 
<br><br>
He also specializes in sugar sculpture - elaborate, decorative pieces created from just sugar. He often teams up with Roycio to create stunning cake toppers and embellishments for some of Royce's artistic special occasion cakes.
<br><br>
Oddly enough, Popswirl doesn't have much of a sweet tooth. He always explains that he isn't making candy and chocolates for himself, but to bring smiles to others.

<h2>Fae Baker</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
Floury is a brownie - a type of faerie, not the delicious dessert - that came to life when a bottle of faerie dust was accidentally spilled on top of a bag of flour. No taller than a spoon and extremely shy, he is rarely seen by anyone besides Roycio and Biscoffs.
<br><br>
Brownies usually come out at night and perform household chores while the other residents are asleep. In keeping with this instinct, Floury starts the prep for the next morning's baking while Roycio snoozes in his loft upstairs. He takes great pride in his work and is secretly pleased when Roycio thanks him every morning. 
<br><br>
Floury tries his very best to help Roycio in the kitchen whenever he needs it during the day, but sometimes it gets too busy and loud and he retreats to the cabinets for a break. His very best friend, Biscoffs, is helping him gain more confidence so he can help Roycio even more. 
<br><br>
Hidden in one of the kitchen's least used cabinets is Floury's secret treasure hoard; buttons, sequins, and anything else small and shiny that customers unknowingly leave behind and Floury collects once everyone has left. He loves his treasure almost as much as his favorite treat - a crouton dipped in milk.

<h2>Fae Cookie</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
Each year on Gnorbu Day, Love At First Bite makes a stunning display of gnorbu shaped cookies in over 20 different flavors. Occasionally, less than perfectly shaped cookies come out of the oven. They get placed in the reject pile and given to all the employees after their hard work on the bakery's busiest day. 
<br><br>
One year during this hectic time, Floury was so overwhelmed by all the people and commotion. He hid deep in the cabinets and wished for a friend that was his size and nice, and not loud and scary. 
<br><br>
At the same exact moment Floury wished that wish, Roycio sneezed faerie dust on a cookie that was a little too rotund with legs a little too short. The cookie came to life in an explosion of sprinkles and a new member of the family was born.
<br><br>
Unlike his best friend Floury, Biscoffs enjoys customers' attention and enjoys it even more when they give him some whipped cream from their lattes or a taste of icing from their pastries.

<h2>Honey Faerie</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
From the cafe's patio, one can see a curious section of land walled off by shrubbery, and another section of open land covered in wildflowers. Placed in the corner furthest away from the cafe is what appears to be multiple beehives. These hives are lovingly tended to by Tisfe, a honey faerie with the sweetest disposition. 
<br><br>
He loves to chat with Meugi about pollinator gardens and giving out bottles of his bee's honey. He seems to subsist purely on cups of Eilho's tea, heavily sweetened with honey - at least that's what Biscoffs will tell everyone.
<br><br>
Even though he is a being made entirely out of honey, Tisfe magically doesn't leave any honey behind at his touch. Although, if you're in a pinch for something to sweeten your tea - he'll gladly spare a drop of honey for your cup.

<h2>Green Thumb Faerie</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
Behind the cafe, past the patio and Meugi's garden, is a line of perfectly kept tall hedges signaling the end of the cafe's property and keeping the other side out of view. However, there is a door-sized gap in the line, flanked by two conical topiaries and punctuated by a rustic arch trellis covered in beautiful wisteria. A stone pathway encourages patrons to wander from the patio and into a huge, stunning English garden. There are even two greenhouses within the garden and rows of award winning rose hybrids.
<br><br>
The mastermind behind this tranquil haven is a horticultural fae named Shrubberys. Shrubberys is an old soul of little words. He spends all day tending to his garden and generally avoiding those who visit it. He's happy that his passion can bring joy to others, but he doesn't need to talk to them about it. The only person he begrudgingly speaks to on a regular basis is Meugi, who often comes around for gardening tips and to pester Shrubs for new clippings.
<br><br>
The secret to his horticultural success is that he can actually hear the wishes and needs of his plants as they whisper to him whenever he is near. His wisterias are full of wisdom, his roses a bit demanding, and his topiary a bit vain - but he loves them all the same.

Eiloh gives her a small cup of whipped cream to feed Biscoffs while he joins her for their morning chat. Weather permitting, they sit on the patio and gossip with anyone willing to listen.
<br><br>
She purposely leaves behind her shiniest pennies for Floury, even though she has never seen him before. Kirst knows how important he is to Biscoffs and so hopes to meet him one day.

<h2>Bumbly Bee</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
Chubisc is the guardian of Tisfe's hive. He lives, eats, sleeps, and buzzes with the bees 24/7. He can't exactly fit inside the hives - he's small but a little too round from all the nectar &amp; honey - so he sleeps in a flower nest a few feet away. 
<br><br>
Chubby keeps the bees out of trouble and raises the alarm when trespassers come too close. He has a few long standing grudges against several local racoons and one skunk. Chubby's also fluent in the bee's dance language. He relays their needs and wants to Tisfe, who is still learning their language.

<h2>Fire Goddess</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
Long ago, longer than she cares to remember, Nhout was chosen as a sacrifice to appease the gods and save her village from an impending volcanic eruption. She was caught between the rage of two gods, and fell to her tragic death in the lava below. Before passing on to the underworld, her soul was intercepted to become the new deity of the volcano.
<br><br>
She has now settled into her immortality and godly duties thanks in part to her servant Trovus and friend Winterdeer.

<h2>Magma Familiar</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
Before Nhout became a goddess, when she was a mere mortal, she loved with her whole heart. She was known for her loyalty and selflessness that made the world seem like a better place. 
<br><br>
When she was taken from the mortal realm, her love was reciprocated in kind. Those of whom her kindness had touched mourned for the loss of such a bright light. They prayed to whomever would listen that she could feel just a sliver of that love in return.
<br><br>
The gods must have listened. For not soon after she crossed into the immortal realm and danced with fire - a being came forth from the molten core of Nhimra. The heart of the mountain itself fell at her feet and pledged eternal companionship.
<br><br>
Nheyt represents Nhout's heart and the devotion of her loyal patrons.

<h2>Northern Goddess</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
Seriliya is a goddess that is as cold as the lands she rules. Those that live in the harsh conditions of the North Sea only survive because they are equally as rough and tumultuous.
<br><br>
These are Seriliya's people - the devotees that believe her mercy keeps them alive. It is said that meeting one's end in battle is the greatest way to honor the goddess.
<br><br>
Seriliya watches over her favorite warriors and blesses them with boons in battle. Warriors that have gained her favor and pride but have met their untimely end in the throes of battle are given a second life serving at her side for eternity.

<div class="words">
<p>
There comes a time when heroes become legends and no one is sure if they actually existed.
<br><br>
There was a time when Dulfrost was a fearless leader and brave warrior. He was so favored by the goddess Seriliya that he seemed almost untouchable in battle. But all heroes met their end eventually.
<br><br>
When his spirit entered the afterworld, Seriliya ushered him to her side, as she could not bear to lose her favorite warrior. She stretched her arms across the weather and grabbed his spirit with her ice cold hands. His essence froze at the touch as Seriliya dragged him to her side. She blessed him with a corporeal form, but as his spirit was now as cold as his goddess, his form was forever encased in snow.
<br><br>
His ceaseless devotion to the goddess has earned him the position of Seriliya's most trusted advisor and confidant. He relishes every minute by her side and will go to the ends of the world for his goddess.

<h2>Freshwater Sprite</h2>

Winterdeer is a creature that no human has ever had the privy of viewing - a water daimon. Halfway between an incorporeal being and the force of water itself. His terrestrial form appears as spindly deer with a mane of flowing water. Any body of water is his domain; from lakes and rivers, to puddles and bogs. With a touch that purifies, his eternal duty is to protect the life-force of the forest. 
<br><br>
As his spirit is bound to water, he can never step foot on land. Instead, he travels by dissolving his form back into the water and then reemerges in a different body of freshwater, no matter the distance or size. He speaks very little, but when he does it is almost a whisper; like ripples on the surface of a pond during a calm day.

<h2>Forest Sprite</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
Remote and obscure, within a dense forest, pines give way to a corse of quaking aspen. As the aspens dance in the breeze, sunlight filters through the canopy and dapples onto the glade beneath. Wildlife is slow to wake in the mornings in this idyllic haven, but eventually the deer start grazing and the ruffled grouse pluck berries from low branches.
<br><br>
In the heart of the glade, in the heart of a hawthorn bush, a curious little sprite wakes each day to the songs of robins. The size of a newborn fawn, a mane of clover, skin the texture of bark, and intricate wings like a dragonfly's - this is the heart of the glade, Woodvales.
<br><br>
Born of nature itself, Woodvales is a protector, a botanist, a guide, a breeze on a hot day, a stream to quench the thirst of deer, a thicket of brambles to hide from the red tailed hawk circling above. 
<br><br>
In the heart of his domain, a brook bubbles forth from the ground and spills into a stream that chases itself downhill, over rocks and through trees. The ancient freshwater sprite Winterdeer was responsible for the birth of this stream at a time before the aspens even took root in the area. The flurry of life that follows in the wake of water is what gave birth to Woodvales.
<br><br>
While his glade could easily be described as an idyllic haven, Woodvales knows better than to disturb the realities of nature. All things living must come to an end in order to nurture the next generation of life.

Kiyrasu is a Leshy - a guardian spirit of the forests. His ambivalence towards people is sometimes seen as temperamental, and as such many are wary to cross him. Especially since he can control the trees; often moving them to trap or disorientate those who travel too deep within the forest. <br>
Not many have actually seen him, preferring to make up tall tales to spread fear around campfires. If they were to meet Kiyrasu though, they would know he has pale white skin, bright green eyes, and a mane of living plants. <br><br>
He dwells within the deepest, darkest part of the forest with his companion Vasek, a white wolf he found abandoned as a pup. They speak in the sounds of the forest; in the songs of birds, the rumbling of bears, and the rustling of leaves.

Watching people fall in love is boring, it's predictable, and it isn't what Holart was created to do. No, Holart doesn't create love, he tests it.

As we all know, love is complicated, love is work. Holart makes sure to keep it that way.

He was there when they realized there was something greater dictating the flow of the stars' magic. His name was born then, from a language that rose and fell in the blink of his eye.

He was there when a bit of his magic first clung to a newborn child and marked them for a life intertwined with his power. He was there as this happened again and again and these children grew to be his oracles - messengers of his whims and listeners of the ebb and flow of the stars' magic.

<h2>Guardian Statue</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
Sentiar first took form on this world as a mass of marble in the workshop of a well renowned craftsman. It took little over a year, but the stone was sculpted into an exquisite sculpture that entranced all who looked at it.
<br><br>
Admired by many, it eventually was sold and moved into the foyer of an estate owned by a wealthy guild leader. It spent a few generations there, and then another few in a different foyer in a different estate. Decades passed as the exquisite statue was sold and bought again and again. Over the century or two since it emerged from an unshapely section of solid earth, it had developed a colorful provenance.
<br><br>
A life journey of thousands of miles, it was exchanged one last time - from the hands of a rich devout merchant, to the Temple of Nhimra. A considerable offering, the statue was placed in the main chamber, amongst the dark stone walls and high ceilings and far behind the obsidian altar.
<br><br>
The temple was built into the base of Mt. Nhimra to be closer to its goddess and to be a physical part of her domain. Nhout takes note of all offerings made to her with varying degrees of interest. On the day Sentiar was placed within the wall of her temple - she took immediate notice. When the halls emptied, she stepped inside the main chamber for the first time in a long time. 
<br><br>
Not only did the beauty of the statue intrigue Nhout - with the ebbs and flows of the earth played out amongst its skin - but it also called to her. The earth it was carved from called to her. It resonated within her and she knew it was meant for something more than a mortal's status symbol.
<br><br>
So, she let the earth within her call back, and the statue came to life at the recognition. Sentiar, she called it, became her sentinel. Astute, resolute, and severe - Sentiar stands guard over Nhout's realm.

Septvn is named as such because he is the seventh son of the seventh king of Woolington.

Septvn was brought up without much purpose or direction - the tutors needed to direct their attention to the children most likely to take the throne some day. Knowing that he was the spare of spares led Septvn to cultivate "less useful" pursuits such as music, storytelling, beer brewing, wilderness survival, and more.
<br><br>
While his other siblings (four brothers and two sisters) have found pursuits they each excel at, Septvn never found anything he truly excelled in. Even Hexon, the sixth child, is an up and coming champion in dressage. Septvn has a lot of hobbies, but he loses interest easily and bounces to whatever new thing catches his fancy. 
<br><br>
He dreams of exploring the world outside his country's borders, collecting stories and sleeping under the stars.
<br><br>
Septvn wishes his family understood that storytelling was a talent worthy of praise. He could entrance anyone willing to listen to his stories. His tales were borrowed from accounts recorded in the royal library, but he longed to have his own experiences to weave into an entrancing tapestry, instead of embellishing the dry accounts of others. Oh, if only he could go on his own adventures! But alas, he mustn't stray too far from the castle, least the kingdom needs a spare spare.

Brcck is a well known master of the sword arts. Her quick feet, laser like focus, and cunning technique have been unrivaled for years. In the past, she taught pupils under strict guidance. However, that came to an abrupt stop after one fateful day.

She once leant her expertise in the appraisal of blades to a university that had inherited a large collection of swords from a mysterious old man. During the inspection of one peculiar blade - Brcck unknowingly bound herself to this cursed blade and changed the course of her fate forever.
<br><br>
The cursed sword is one of the finest in the world, using its dark magic to slice through anything its blade cannot. This blade has stirred envy and dark intentions within its admirers for centuries. With so many of its wielders meeting their ends by nefarious deeds, the sword now craves endless, unrelenting revenge.

Afraid of what endless revenge would do to her mind and heart, Brcck sought desperately for a loophole that would allow the sword to stay quiet and her conscience clear. Now she is a bounty hunter traveling the land to help others in their quests for revenge.

The name "Lavendetta" has been whispered across bar stools and alleyways throughout the country. The name has morphed into a curse, not unlike the boogeyman. When a member of the shadier side of society goes missing - rumors begin to spread that Lavendetta has struck again. Thieves and crooks fear for their lives when their name is whispered as Lavendetta's rumored next victim.
<br><br>
But Lavendetta has a list. A list of members that belong to the Greater Northern Shipping Guild, the legal entity that serves as a front for a dangerous crime syndicate. It is an open secret who really runs the Guild, but political pockets are stuffed deep with bribes to look the other way.
<br><br>
Born as Lavender to a well-to-do family of merchants, she had a comfortable life growing up. However, one month her family refused to pay the 'protection' fees of the Guild, putting their foot down and refusing to bend to the Guild's will. They ended up paying the price of that defiance, and became a nefarious example to others to never cross the Guild. Lavender was traveling that day, in another city visiting with friends. Many called her blessed and lucky - but she only saw the end of her world and the beginning of a rage that burned brighter and brighter. 
<br><br>
Grief gave way to the beginnings of a plan for revenge. She had heard tales of the swordmaster Brcck, who carried out revenge for others with her cursed sword. Lavender traveled across the land to meet with Brcck and present her request. Brcck refused, however, citing that the mindless slaughter of an entire group of people was not revenge, but madness. After Lavender refused to leave, Brcck realized nothing would stop her. The burning fire of rage in her heart had grown too large for it to simply smolder out on its own. Brcck took her on as an apprentice, more tough on Lavender than she had been with any of her other students. For she knew Lavender's quest ahead would be long and dangerous, and any mistake would lead to her end.  
had grown Lavender, so she mentored her until she was almost as good with a blade as Brcck.
<br><br>
Years under the tutelage of Brcck, Lavender was born again with a new purpose. Lavendetta is now taking out the trash one by one, and has the criminal underworld looking over their shoulder in fear of being next.

Shydalu is a traveling merchant that specializes in rare wares from all reaches of the globe. Her wares travel with her in her enchanted caravan.
<br><br>
The enchantments were achieved after a tense, hours-long negotiation with Alchemysts. Shydalu parted with a stash of her extremely rare potion ingredients for the powerful enhancements needed to upgrade her caravan. Both women admire the steadfastness in each over, but will never admit it lest they lose the upper hand.
<br><br>
The caravan has been extended on the inside to be as large as a brick and mortar store. Products on display are magically encased to prevent shoplifting. Extra stock is locked in a back room behind a reinforced door. Also included in the deal was a magic safe that only opens for Shydalu.
<br><br>
The store does not have a counter with a till, but rather a table where interested parties negotiate a sale with Shydalu. In the back corner of the room is a spiral staircase that leads to Shydalu's sleeping quarters. For obvious reasons, the staircase is strictly off limits to visitors.
<br><br>
The caravan is expansive and secured with the strongest magic in the realm. Bandits have learned the hard way that it is an impenetrable fortress even an army would have trouble taking.

Ajinks also knows a lot - well, he 'overhears' a lot. It's not his fault his ears immediately tune into whispers. And it's not his fault people don't notice him as he gets closer to 'overhear' better. Never mind that as a former sneak thief, he is quite good at sneaking.
<br><br>
Shydalu might frown in distaste, but Mohpps pays well for the information he collects. She can't be disappointed he's making honest money! Well...semi-honest money. Mohpps doesn't ask where the information comes from as long as it's reliable. But Ajinks can picture the disappointment on Shydalu's face and the sigh that would follow. She might not actually be his older sister, but she sure acts like it.

It's not like she's the perfect angel everyone claims she is. They say that just because her smile can turn the toughest soldier into a harmless kitten.

There isn't a face or name Mohpps has forgotten. He greets everyone as if they're a long, lost friend. The drinks are cold and the food is served hot. Lodgers can ask for a blanket without receiving a snear, and baths are delivered hot and steaming instead of lukewarm. 
<br><br>
Not only is the Cheshire Inn &amp; Pub known for its excellent service, but it's also known as a major information center. Gossip tends to run rampant when a few brews are involved, and since there are so many regulars, the bar becomes a hotbed of local news.  
<br><br>
A visitor can sit at the bar for an hour and learn much of the comings and goings of many individuals - but if they're wanting to know something specific, all they have to do is ask the man behind the bar.
<br><br>
Mohpps tends not just drinks but also information; Lavendetta's next victim, Alchemysts' latest feat, how to contact Brcck with a bounty, or the goods Shydalu is currently selling. And if the quality of the information reflects the quantity of the visitor's tip? Well then, Mohpps is nothing but a successful businessman.

<div class="words">
<p>
Trovus just needed some stamps. To send a mortal letter through the mortal post to a mortal. <br><br><i>It shouldn't be so confusing to send a missive through the mortal ether,</i> Trovus thought as he cursed bureaucracy.
<br><br>
How did he manage to reanimate an entire corpse when he was just trying to summon the correct postage for his missive? The mortal world will crumble because of bureaucracy, Trovus thought as he tried again to summon stamps; now with a half sentient being off to the side in his workshop. 
<br><br>
A roll of stamps appeared in the middle of his summoning circle. His relief was dashed when he picked up the roll and realized, as all the stamps fluttered off the roll and onto the floor, that the adhesive failed to materialize. He sighed, this really shouldn't be so complicated. His gaze lifted to the body standing awkwardly across the room. Of course, Trovus chastised his stupidity, dragging a spirit from the ether into this realm has disturbed the balance of my magic. Necromancy tended to tip the scales too far away from the neutral side of magic. Smoothing the transition for this spirit should help tip the balance back to his favor.
<br><br>
."You shall be known as ConjureStamps, henceforth," Trovus pursed his lips. Creativity was never his strong suit. The being blinked and tilted its head.
<br><br>
."You may wander freely under my purview," he paused to think of a direct command to give the creature something to do, "Go and find Undo - he is a Farnswap, if that means anything to you. He will surely be somewhere on the property digging up bones. Make sure he at least puts them back in the right grave this time."  
<br><br>
Trovus nodded to himself - this arrangement might actually prove to be useful. ConjureStamps stumbled out of the room with the sudden duty to search for a small creature with an affinity to bones. 
<br><br><br><br>


Conjure may not be that being Undo answers to - but as they are both beings accidentally reanimated by Trovus, they have a certain comradery. 
<br><br>
Conure has a deep seeded desire to collect stamps that he can't seem to shake. Despite that, he longs for more out of his life.
<br><br>
With a bright spirit, he never dwells on what his past might have contained - but rather what his future will bring.

<div class="words">
<p>
Benthos exploration Vessel AI - version J (BVA-J) is an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).
<br><br>
It is equipped with advanced AI, allowing it to explore the seafloor and run experiments without needing direct input from scientists on land.
<br><br>
Its primary mission is to study the local benthos, the community of organisms that live on the bottom of the sea. More specific research aims include: to survey the abundance of individual species, as well as the diversity of species present; research how the seafloor terrain influences benthic organisms; and to gain a better understanding of how pollution and the local water traffic affect these organisms.
<br><br>
BVA-J is equipped with multiple high-resolution cameras, sensors to measure the surrounding environmental factors, and samplers that non-invasively collect environmental and DNA samples.
<br><br>
Every 24 hours or so, BVA-J must return to the surface and recharge its battery on the boat stationed at slip #14. 
<br><br>
Despite being a vessel created solely to research the seafloor, BVA-J has a friendly disposition and will gladly chat with anyone that stops by slip #14 while BVA-J is recharging or under-going routine maintenance.

<h2>Wharf Ghost</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
Primrose Marina prides itself in being around since 1682. Much has changed since then. One thing that hasn't is the ever present ghost of a young sailor. Most people who come and go do not see this whisper of the past. He isn't there to haunt or seek revenge, he is simply here, forever tied to the physical realm. 
<br><br>
Wharve has resided at Primrose Marina for a long time, watching cloth sails turn into steel motors and treated lumber into sleek metal. The vessels that once carried barrels of sherry and bushels of wheat now take a few adventure-seeking folk on a meandering path out at sea before returning. No shipments, no missions, no goal at all from what he can discern - except for a slice of entertainment and escapism. He has learned over the years such aimless trips are called "vacations".
<br><br>
He scarcely remembers events from when he was alive, but he does remember the aches of hard labor, the pain of hunger, and the constant uncertainty of his future. Perhaps it is not such a bad thing for such trials of the sea to be a thing of the past.

<h2>Navel Naval</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
Navally didn't ask for this. He didn't ask to be kicked out of his apartment. And he certainly didn't ask for his recently deceased grandfather to leave him anything in his will.
<br><br>
And he most certainly didn't ask to be both terrified of open water and to be the new owner of a houseboat.
<br><br>
Pragmatically, he knows this is the best course of action. He needs a place to live and there is a perfectly good houseboat in his name that is completely paid off. All he has to pay is the marina fee, which is way less than the rent he was paying before he got evicted. 
<br><br>
But as he stands in the marina's office with his new set of keys in one hand and a suitcase in the other - he can't seem to make his legs start moving. He caught sight of the harbor and a flood of irrational fears clogged his brain.
<br><br>
He went through some of the breathing exercises his therapist taught him until his heart rate returned to normal. Step by step he made it across the dock and to the side of the boat.
<br><br>
There was a dubious plank across the sliver of water between the deck and the boat. Navally took a deep breath, squeezed his eyes closed, and ran across the bridge.
<br><br>
And there he was. In his new home. He went below deck, placed his suitcase on the couch in the galley, and slowly walked to the bedroom. He collapsed on the bed, continuing his breathing exercises to calm his heart. The waves of the harbor gently rocked the entire boat. Navally first found it alarming, but the less he focused on the fact he was on water, and more on the solid walls around him and the soft bed underneath him, the gentle rocking lured him to sleep.
<br><br>
When he woke hours later, Navally reckoned he'd never slept that well in his life.

<h2>Yacht Socialite</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
Yvesanna is a beautiful socialite that spends most of her time on her father's yacht (which is, not coincidentally, named Anna of Yves). 
<br><br>
He barely uses the yacht anyways, giving Yvesanna free reign to throw as many parties as she wants. She's at the marina so often she practically lives there. Note "practically", not actually like Giorgieo does.
<br><br>
That's another thing, she lets her best friend Giorgieo stay there (unless Father needs the yacht to impress clients - then Giorg has to clear out). In return, Giorg hosts the best parties. She has her own set of people to impress.
<br><br>
She doesn't understand why her father is so obsessed with Primrose Marina. There are much better marinas to keep their yacht in - but no, he likes that "history" of it or something lame like that. Whatever. She will admit though, it is picturesque and looks great in her Insta stories.
<br><br>
The best thing about Primrose Marina, she supposes, is that anything goes. No one really knows who her dad is here, so there's no one to tell on her. Except Scuttlest, but they have an agreement - she keeps him employed, and he doesn't tell her dad when she asks him to take the yacht out of the harbor. No one complains when her parties go through the night into the early light of day, with music so loud it can be heard even from the lighthouse. She likes to think it's because all the other patrons are too intimidated by her beauty to confront her. 
<br><br>
That's another thing, there's also no one there that really knows who she is, so she doesn't have to be perfect all the time. She can run to the cafe without makeup and no one is going to take a photo of her and post it on social media. It's weird, people are actually nice around Primrose Marina. So unlike the other parts of her life, where everything is cutthroat and you never know who your friends really are. 
<br><br>
Some nights, when it's just her and Giorgieo, and she's lying on the deck looking up at the stars - she thinks this is what life should be. Simple. But then her phone pings with a notification and simple seems so far away.

<h2>DJ Yatcht</h2>

Giorgio is a producer, musician, and best friend to Yvesanna. In that order. He's going to be really famous one day, he swears. But for now he's a producer with a modest following that lives on his best friend's dad's yacht. He swears he can afford his own place, but it would be stupid to pass up free rent, right? Also living on a yacht suits his brand so much better than living in a one-bedroom apartment. 
<br><br>
Yvesanna likes to think the marina is beneath them, but he likes the place. He's even started to become more acquainted with the other patrons. He even invites Navally to go get coffee sometimes, now that he no longer looks perpetually terrified.

<h2>Lighthouse Keeper</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
Just a little bit down the shore from the marina is a picturesque lighthouse that is still in use. It is largely on an automated system these days, but it still requires a live-in keeper for general upkeep and in case of emergencies. 
<br><br>
The keeper is a quiet individual named Chrollian, who likes more than anything to keep to himself. Living in solitude in an old lighthouse is his idea of a perfect life. He has been deemed a recluse by the locals, and is not in a rush to dissuade that notion. 
<br><br>
Chrollian simply loves the company of a good book more than the company of others. He gets groceries delivered to him by Navally, and he buys everything else he needs online_  so he sees little point in going into town. Although, he does enjoy the company of Wharve when he occasionally comes by to watch old black and white films.
<br><br>
Chrollian is a prolific reader; every surface in the living quarters of the lighthouse is covered in stacks of books. He also writes scholarly essays in his spare time. His favorite topic to write on is philosophy - and most of these essays could be classified under "Nihilism". 
<br><br>
Chrollian, however, will argue that classification strata is meaningless and that his works are simply just "A collection of words in which every individual derives a different meaning from, because our notion of language is merely a reflection of our societal upbringing. Since there are a multitude of interpretations, there is no singular true meaning that stems from the words I have selected, and thus they are intrinsically meaningless." In other words - he can be very insufferable.

<h2>Silver Fish</h2>
<div class="words">
<p>
Clupeidae is a small fish in the Clupeidae family. He is a small fish with smooth, silvery scales - much like his cousins the herring or the sardine. 
<br><br>
Cluppy has a large family, but he is the bravest of all his brothers and sisters. He likes to venture out on his own- but never too far from home! One day he noticed a strange metal creature investigating one of the sunken people vessels. Curious as ever, Cluppy introduced himself and surprisingly the metal thing spoke Fish! It introduced itself as BVA-J, an AI robot (whatever that means) that studies shipwrecks and the ocean floor. How cool! 
<br><br>
Clupeidae and his family were identified by BVA-J to be a unique species of fish. His name in Fish is impossible to say in human languages, so BVA-J simply refers to him in notes as "Clupeidae". BVA-J is not the most creative AI out there.
<br><br>
Cluppy likes to join BVA-J on their expeditions and gossip about the ins and outs of the ocean floor community.

<h2>Hermit Hoarder Crab</h2>

<p>
Kolakola is a timid, but grouchy, little hermit crab that lives at the marina. He collects anything shiny that is small enough for him to carry back to his home sweet hoard. His collection includes twelve crumpled aluminum cans, an altoid tin filled with loose change, a broken light bulb filament, and twenty-eight gum wrappers - the kind with the silver lining.
<br><br>
Not many at the marina know he exists, since he is not one for socializing and keeps to underneath the boardwalks. Kolakola is only regularly seen by Navally, but that has more to do with the shiny pennies Navally gives him than anything to do with "friendship".

Biolag is a living petri dish (that's what he says he is anyways) who "coincidentally" studies bacterial growth cycles. <br><br>

Biolag moves over to a dry erase board. His movement is more of a glide instead of the steady cadence of steps. It is as if he is actually made of trillions of tiny organisms.
<br><br>
."The growth of a colony of bacteria can be represented as a logarithmic curve," no one asked, but he begins to explain anyway.
<br><br>
He pops the cap off a dry erase marker, draws an x- and y-axis, then a rough looking curve. He labels the x-axis as 'time' and the y-axis and 'log # of bacteria'.
<br><br>
He points to a short flat section at the start of the curve, "This is called the lag phase." He labels it. "When bacteria are added to a new medium, a lag phase occurs as the cells adjust to the new environment."
<br><br>
Then he gestures to the steep diagonal rise in the curve, "bacteria then enter the log phase, in which the population grows exponentially. This growth continues until the population hits the stationary phase…"
<br><br>
He labels the flat top of the curve. Then continues to discuss reasons a population hits this phase and how it can be predicted. Through his ramblings, he fails to see no one is in the room anymore.

Just let him be, he's in his own world now.

EmGFP stands for Emerald Green Fluorescent Protein. This is a twist on the classic GFP. GFP is a protein that was originally discovered in the jellyfish Aequorea victoria. This species uses the green fluorescent protein to provide flashes of green bioluminescence.
<br><br>
Scientists studied this jellyfish and were able to identify the gene that produces this protein. Knowing this piece of genetic code was exciting because now scientists now had a reporter gene they could insert in tandem with a gene of interest into cell cultures, bacteria, and other organisms. If the gene of interest was successfully introduced into the cells, the GFP gene would also be expressed. If the organism glowed green - the experiment worked!
<br><br>
EmGFT is a next-generation GFP that has been optimized for mammalian use. EmGFP (the gnorbu, not the protein) is living proof this reporter gene works! He seems normal at first, but shine blue light at him and he lights up like a glow stick!

<h2>Living Fossil</h2>

<p>
A living fossil is a species that superficially looks like an ancestral species that we only know from fossils. Swengu is not actually millions of years old. His lineage just hasn't changed much in that time.
<br><br>
It does not escape him, the irony, that he is a paleontologist with a prolific career. He has published many seminal works that have solidified hypothesized taxonomy or brought current classifications into question. At the time of writing this, he has 18 extinct species named after him.
<br><br>
One of his major works was the discovery of the common ancestor of the canidae petpets; the doglefox, droolik, manjeer, puppyblew, spardel, warf, and zomutt. While it had been long hypothesized that they were part of the same clade, Swengu found the fossilized remains of the species confirmed to be their common ancestor. This also allowed biologists to narrow down the time frame in which these species began to diverge, giving us a more accurate picture of when each of these species became domesticated.
