- If you see an <span class="u">ABC Extra</span>, this means it's miscellaneous information that you might find interesting.
<br>
- Some of the animations might seem to lag.  This is probably due to the large number of graphics and 
other animated images.  To view an animation, try isolating it by dragging and dropping it into the address bar.
<br>
- Tutorials are for <i>Photoshop 7</i>.  However, the same concepts can be carried over to GIMP.
<br>
- Screenshots and other large images have been scaled down.  To view the full size, right-click on and choose "View Image" or drag and drop into the address bar.
<br>
- This is <b>not</b> an animating guide.  Because I use Photoshop 7 and animate in GIMP, my technique for animating will be too complicated for many people to follow.

<h1>Ch.1: Terminology</h1>
If you're completely new to making buttons, this page is a great area to start.  Here, I'll go over some terms I'll be using throughout the guide. 
<br><h2>Border</h2>
The border is what frames your button base image.  Having a border (and in most cases, an inner white 
border) is a very good way to make your button look unique and finished.  Here are some examples:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/OpenEyes/normal.png" style="padding: 3px;" title="Normal border; just as it sounds, this one is a completely normal border"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/reellife.gif" style="padding: 3px;" title="Inverted Border; uses a white thicker outer border rather than a black one, while using a thin black inner border instead of the typical white"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/solace.gif" style="padding: 3px;" title="Widescreen Border; one that I came up with myself!"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/sweettooth.gif" style="padding: 3px;" title="Candy Border; it's a super cute border that's popular with many requesters"></center>
<p>
<span class="u">ABC Extra:</span> Hover over the images to see what I call each border type.
<br></p>
<h2>Text and image placement</h2>
This term is very important and it's something to get familiar with because I'll definitely be making references to this throughout the guide.  Text and image placement is the area they take up on the button.  For example:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<a href="/~interstade"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/buriedtreasure.gif" border="0"></a>
</center>
<p>
The text placement is on the right while the image placement is on the left.  You could also go a step further to describe your text placement and say that the text is on the right side of the button, centered between the top and bottom border.
</p>
<p>
Here's another example:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<a href="/~interstade"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/baranni.png" border="0"></a>
</center>
<p>
It's the opposite here.  The text placement is on the left (centered between the top and bottom border) and the image placement is on the right.
</p>
<p>
And one last example:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<a href="/~interstade"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/colorblock.gif" border="0"></a>
</center>
<p>
The text placement is completely centered.  There's no main image, so we can't say a lot about its placement.
<br></p>
<h2>Focal image</h2>
The focal image is the main image on your button.  Ideally, you wouldn't want more than one since that can make your button look busy and complicated (there <i>are</i> examples of multiple focal images which I'll point out later).  Here are some examples:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<a href="/~interstade"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/sushiroll.gif" border="0"></a>
</center>
<p>
Here, the focal image is the sushi on the left.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<a href="/~interstade"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/zomutthills.gif" border="0"></a>
</center>
<p>
The focal image is the zomutt on the right side of the button.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<a href="/~interstade"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/flux.gif" border="0"></a>
</center>
<p>
In this example, there's no focal <i>image</i> as the button base uses a simple pattern in the background.  However, we can still use the term "focal" to describe the text.  Here, the text <i>is</i> the focal point of the button.

<br></p>
<h2>Breathing space</h2>
This term relates to <i>animation</i> and it's how I describe the amount of time between each animation loop before it repeats again.  In other words, "breathing space" will refer to static text, rather than the dynamic animation sequence.  Here's an example:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/OpenEyes/example1.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/OpenEyes/example2.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
In the first button, there is <i>little to no</i> breathing space.  The sweeping animation repeats almost instantly.  In the second animation, there's approximately 10 static frames (i.e. "normal text" where no animation occurs).  This is the breathing space between each animation loop.

<br></p>
<h2>Small font versus "large" fonts</h2>
Small fonts include 04b03, Bangalore, and Wendy.  Here's a visual example:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/OpenEyes/example5.png"></center>
<p>
I like to call these the "tried and true" fonts because they <i>will work</i> with the majority of buttons you produce.  On the other hand, "large" fonts are much more popular to use these days.  Here are some examples of buttons that use "large" fonts:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/moonless_2.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/promise.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/able_2.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Using large fonts is <i>much harder</i> than using small fonts because it requires you to analyze the amount of space you have on your button base. 

<br></p>
<h2>Animation</h2>
This doesn't really need an explanation, but there are some animation types that may need more clarification.  Take a look at these:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/demure_2.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
The animation here is what I call "fading", where one text phrase fades to another (here, the phrase "vote for me @" fades to "demure" and back again).  With this type of animation, it <i>directly</i> impacts text visibility and clarity.  I suppose you can call it <i>text visibility animation</i> because the animation will always have an impact on the text readability.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/gingersnap.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Here, the sweep animation goes through the text, but the words are always visible on the button image (i.e. it doesn't "fade").  With this type of animation, I tend to refer to them as  <i>text-based animation</i>.  Though not as "intensive" as the other example, these animations tend to use the text in some way, such as sweeping through them with colour or blinking from one letter to the text.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/tog.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
This is probably the best type of animation in terms of text visibility because it has no impact on the text itself (note that I'm <i>not</i> talking about the sparkle effect specifically).  Here, the animation goes <i>around</i> the text and uses the background instead.  Because the animation is completely distinct and doesn't interfere with the text in any way, I call these sort of animations <i>base animations</i>.

<h1>Ch 2: Choosing an image</h1>
Alrighty, let's get started!  The first thing you should think about is what you want your button to look like.  Do you want to use an image or a simple textured background?  Most buttons that have images look very nice, but that doesn't mean you "have" to use one.  It's completely up to you!  I'll be providing examples with <i>both</i> images and textured buttons.  

<br><h2>Images with focal points</h2>
Here are some examples of buttons that have focal points:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/shinybutter.png" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/parchment.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/image_1.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Here are some examples of easy to use images:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/games/new_tradingcards/lg_pteri_day_2005.gif" style="padding: 3px;" width="100" height="100" title="the Pteri's face"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/new_tradingcards/lg_bruce_day_2004.gif" style="padding: 3px;" width="100" height="100" title="the snow Bruce or the Candychan"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/new_tradingcards/lg_chocchiaday_2006.gif" style="padding: 3px;" width="100" height="100" title="either of the two Chias"></center>
<p>
Notice that in each of the three examples above, the optimal choice for a focal image is extremely apparent and easy to find.

<br></p>
<h2>Textured or general background images</h2>
Here are some examples of buttons that use textures or a generic background as the base:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/erised.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/flux.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/karma_3.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/able.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
The first two use a texture or pattern, while the third and fourth example use a Neopet background (like those found at <a href="/~Voget">Charly's SWF Collection</a>).
<br></p>
<h2>Combining a focal point <i>with</i> a textured background</h2>
If you own a button request site, chances are you'll come across this problem.  A requester wants you to use an image that has a white background such as this:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/image_2.png" style="padding: 3px; float: left;" width="150"></center>
<p>
Sure, you can crop that image to 88 by 31 pixels, but a white background is <i>so dull</i>!  Just take a look:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/image_3.png" style="padding: 3px;" border="0"></center>
<p>
Here's my technique for combining a focal image with a textured background.
</p>
<h3>Tutorial: Blending images with textured backgrounds</h3>
<i>Step 1: </i> Take a look at your focal image and note the dominant colours.  In this case, the faerie grarrl's colour palette consists mainly of a strong orange colour with pink highlights.
<p>
<i>Step 2:</i> Look for a textured or patterned background.  To make things easier for yourself, keep your colour palette in mind and search for something that's orange in colour.  Here are some great examples:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/image_4.png" style="padding: 3px;" border="0" height="100" width="100" title="texture from deviantArt"><a href="/~ilvire"><img src="http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/297/3/e/texture_31_by_xnienke-d4dst39.jpg" style="padding: 3px;" border="0" height="100" width="100" title="texture from Details"></a>
</center>
<p>
<i>Step 3:</i> Crop the texture to 88 pixels by 31 pixels.  I'll be using the first example for this tutorial.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 4:</i> With your image (i.e. not the button base), select all of the white area.  
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/image_5.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 5:</i> 
At the very top of your main screen, click "Select" and then "Inverse".  As a quick alternative, you can also hold Shift and Ctrl, then press "I".
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/image_6.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
This inverts the selection.  Now the grarrl is the area getting selected, not the white background.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 6:</i> Hold "Ctrl", then press "C" to copy the selection.  Try not to "cut" the image out (i.e. don't press Ctrl + X).  Sometimes when I "cut" images rather than copy, the edges are much more jagged and there's more "white" bits.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 7:</i> Going back to your textured button base, paste your grarrl image by holding Ctrl and pressing "V".
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 8:</i> Since the grarrl image is very large, I'll need to resize.  To do this, I make sure the layer with the grarrl image is highlighted.  Next, I hold Ctrl and press "T" (alternatively, you can also go to the top of your screen, click "Edit", and choose "Free Transform").  Now that your focal image is selected, hold the "shift" key and use the four corners to make your image smaller.  You <i>must</i> hold the shift key while doing this because that keeps your image's original proportions.  If you don't hold the shift key, you'll end up with a "squished" looking image.

<p>
<i>Step 8:</i> Once you've resized your focal image, it should look something like this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/image_8.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
The focal image still looks a bit awkward though.  It's not blended very well into the background texture.  While you <b>can</b> leave it like this, let's go a step (or two) further.  I'm going to rotate my Grarrl image so that it faces the opposite direction.  
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/image_9.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 9:</i> With my image layer selected, I add a <b>layer mask</b> (alternatively, you can go to the top of the screen, click "Layer", choose "Add Layer Mask", and choose "Reveal All").
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/image_10.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 10:</i>  A quick and easy way to "blend" images is to apply a gradient mask that makes the image seem as if it's fading. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/image_11.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center> 
<p>
After applying the gradient, I'm left with this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/image_12.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Using this technique, I created this button for a requester:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<a href="/~interstade"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/scotti.gif" border="0"></a>
</center>
<p>
<span class="u">ABC Extra:</span>  Sometimes you'll find a nice pattern or texture that you want to use as a base but it may not fit your colour 
palette.  In this case, you can use gradient layers to re-colour your texture/pattern.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Final tips</h2>
- If you're just starting out, try to choose simplistic images that are relatively neutral in colour.  Stay away 
from anything that is super complicated (such as the Christmas example with tons of pets in the image).  In 
terms of colour, the more simplistic the colour palette, the easier it'll be for you.  For example, 
the faerie pteri image only has a few main colours (yellow, pink tones).  Once you become more experienced, 
you can isolate colours and shift the palette towards one shade or another.

<h1>Ch 3: Cropping</h1>
Cropping's so easy.  You can just skip this chapter and go on to the next.
<p>
<b>Wrong!</b>  Cropping is actually the biggest issue I come across when I'm reviewing button request sites.  It <i>may</i> seem like a basic concept, but it's actually pretty hard.  We all know what we want to crop for: a focal image.  However, getting there might be a bit tricky.  New button makers often make the mistake of cropping for too large an image, or too small.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/cropping_1.png"></center>
<p>
Here's another image example:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/cropping_2.png" width="300" height="50"></center>
<br><h2>Common mistakes</h2>
<b>Cropping images and making them too small</b>
<br>
An example of this is the first button base in the "Cropping" image above.  The purple hot air balloon is absolutely tiny and so many details are lost. This problem often occurs is when button makers crop for the entire body, rather than the face only.
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/cropping_3.png"></center>
<p>
Another common issue is when button makers crop for the entire <i>scenery</i> rather than focus
on one aspect of it.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/cropping_4.png"></center>
<p>
Though this isn't a "rule", my general preference is to devote 50% of the button to imagery and the other half to text.  A lot of sites have longer site names (especially with link directories where it's (Name's) Directory) so I always like to 
have room to work with.
<br></p>
<h2>Cropping for a single focal point</h2>
This is probably the most common choice for button makers.  Cropping for <i>one</i> focal point means there's a deeper focus to your button.  In other words, it's the main "picture" that the viewer sees.  Here are two examples:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/clockcatchers.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/thefontbarista_2.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
In the first example, the clock is the focal image.  In the second, it's the cupcake.  
</p>
<p>
<span class="u">ABC Extra:</span> If you're a completely new button maker, my advice is to crop for a single focal point on the left or right side.  This means that your text should be on the opposite side of your focal point (for example if your main image is on the left, your text placement should be on the right, making use of that empty space).
</p>
<p>
There are some rare cases where the focal image can be in other areas, like these:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/frequentflyer_2.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/downfall.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
In the first example, the image of the plane stretches across the top half of the button.  While the text placement could have been placed on the far right, writing it out across the bottom makes better use of space.  It also emphasizes the entirety of the plane, rather than just the front half.  In the second example, the focal image is the spiky cave formations which help frame the text.
</p>
<p>
In all of the examples above, there is only <i>one</i> picture that is considered to be the "focal point".
<br></p>
<h2>More than one focal point</h2>
In very rare cases, your button may have more than one focal image.  This is extremely hard to do because most of the time you button may look too busy or messy.  However, there are some examples I managed to track down:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<a href="/~duchess_gydo"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GabXm.gif" style="padding: 3px;" border="0"></a>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/visiblesketches_3.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
The first button, made by <a href="//www.neopets.com/~duchess_gydo">Box</a>, uses two main aspects of the button as "focal images".  both the white flower on the right side and the text act as focal images. When the text is on screen, it's the focal point, but when it fades and we only see the background, then the white flower also acts as a secondary focal point. 
</p>
<p>
In the second example, the text isn't the main focal point - it's the palm tree on the left and the building on the right. While the text could have been placed on top of the tree (making the building the only focal point), putting it in the middle centers the two images.  It also helps frame the text a bit better and makes it a part of the entire scenery.
<br></p>
<h2>Cropping a texture or pattern</h2>
For textures and patterns, you won't have a specific focal point.  What you're aiming to do here is use parts of the texture or pattern as a background to provide some style to your text.  Here are some examples:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/cloudyskyagency.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/colorblock.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
The first button uses a cloud background but we can't really call it a "focal point" because one area of the image isn't favoured over another.  Here, the pattern has been cropped to include the details of the cloud.  The second button is a bit more interesting because that uses a texture.  It's been cropped to provide a sense of colour symmetry (note the orange tones on the left and right, but also the contrast of blue and green).  
</p>
<p>
<b>Do you want a general texture or do you want to capture the texture's details?</b>  Here's an example of what I mean:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/cropping_5.png" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/cropping_6.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Both bases use the same grungy texture.  The difference is that in the first example, I scaled down the 
texture to 88 by 31px.  In the second, I opened up an empty 88 by 31 px screen, and pasted that 
same texture in there.  Then, I moved it around to find an area that I'd like to use for the button base.  
The difference is astounding, isn't it?  It all really depends on your intentions for your button base.  Here's another example:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/cropping_7.png" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/cropping_8.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Like the previous set of button bases, I did the same thing with these two.  The first example is scaled down, the second is "full sized".  Note that this time, the second button base isn't that great.  That's because the texture was quite blurry to begin with.  While I could sharpen it to create a functional button base, why not scale the image down?  That's what I did in the first example and it looks much better.  Notice how at super small sizes, the major blurry issue isn't noticeable in the first button.  Instead, you just see a nice watercolour effect.
</p>
<p>
<b>Tips for using texture/pattern button bases</b>
<br>
- Don't rely on them too much.  If all you use for your button bases are textures and patterns, your buttons will generally start to look similar!
<br>
- If you are using textures as button bases, make sure that they're varied.  Don't just use bokeh textures, but try abstract, light, grunge, you name it!
<br></p>
<h3>Tutorial: Cropping images in Photoshop</h3>
I've talked about <i>what</i> to crop for but now let's actually crop the image!  In this tutorial, I'll be cropping for a <i>single</i> focal point.  Here's what I'll be using:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/button_example.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<b>Step 1:</b> Open up your image in Photohop 7.  In your Tools screen, click the "Crop" tool (alternatively, you can press "C" on your keyboard for a quicker and easier method).  In the screenshot below, I've highlighted the Crop tool in a red square.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/cropping_9.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
When you click that tool, the options near the top of your screen should change.  Make sure that your values are similar to what I have in the screen above.  When typing in the width and height, remember to type in <b>px</b> to indicated that you want it to be 88 <b>pixels</b>, rather than cm or any other measurement.
</p>
<p>
<span class="u">ABC Extra:</span> If you just type 88 and 31, then the program will only scale your image in terms of the ratio.  For example, your image might still 216 px in width and 76 in height even after cropping.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 2:</i> 
With the Crop tool selected, click on your image, hold down and drag to create a rectangle.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/cropping_10.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
The dark areas will be the "deleted" parts of the image, while the area inside the four squares will be the button base.  You can move the rectangle around the image and re-size it however you want.  I want the Scorchio's face to be the focal image so this is how I cropped mine:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/cropping_11.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 3:</i> When you're happy with your selection, hit "Enter" on your keyboard and your image will be cropped to your selection.  Alternatively, you can also look near the top of your screen and click the checkmark as indicated in the screenshot below.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/cropping_12.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<span class="u">ABC Extra:</span>  Did you hit the "Enter" key only to be unhappy with your button base?  Quickly go back to your "original" image by holding the "Ctrl"  key and pressing "Z".  
</p>
<p>
And we're done!  The image is cropped and here's what it looks like:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/cropping_13.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Final tips</h2>
- After cropping, your image may become blurry.  Be sure that when you're <i>editing</i> your button base, you remember to sharpen it to make it crisp again.  In the tutorial above, the image quality is relatively nice though I'd probably sharpen it once I start adding textures.
<p>
- Sometimes, you might be using an image where the focal point isn't as obvious as others.  Here's an example:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/games/new_tradingcards/lg_happyheroes_day.gif" style="padding: 3px;" width="200" height="20"></center>
<p>
What I  like to do is open up the image multiple times in my workspace (i.e. I'll have about three or four screens with the same image).  In each of the screens, I'll crop to a different area.  After, I'll compare all of them to see which one works best with the text I'll be writing on it.
</p>
<p>
- Cropping is something that many new button makers need to work at because it's the first step in creating a high-quality button.  If your image looks "squished" or stretched out, then your button has already made a negative impression.


<br></p>

<br><br><div class="smallbox">
<a name="ch4"></a>
<h1>Ch 4: Editing</h1>
Cropping an image and slapping on borders and text is <i>not</i> how you make a button.  Well, not a high-quality one, anyways.  You'll need to edit your image a bit further to make it interesting and creative.
<p>
</p>
<h2>Sharpen to enhance image clarity</h2>
Make sure the image isn't blurry. One of the <i>most common issue</i> for new (<b>and</b> veteran) button makers is that their button base image is too blurry and isn't crisp or clear. 
A blurry image makes the button look low-quality. Especially when you're working with small images, the clarity of the picture will degrade with more texture layouts applied on top.  To view a tutorial on sharpening your button base, click <a href="#sharpen">here</a>. 


<p>
Here's a comparison of button bases. One was left unsharpened and the other has been sharpened. 

</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/frequentflyer/flowerbomb.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
While the one on the right isn't that bad (I've seen much worse button bases around), it's still not very clear. There is so much more detail to be seen with the sharpened image.  No matter how well a button maker has designed the border, coloured the image, or styled the font, a blurry image is an instant marker of low-quality.
<br></p>
<h3>Tutorial: A "soft and dreamy" effect</h3>
This is probably the first "technique" I learned as a graphics maker way back in the day.  It's not only super easy, but it makes your image look so vibrant and pretty.
<p>
<i>Step 1:</i> Open up your button base in Photoshop.  For this tutorial, I'll be using this example.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_1-1.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 2:</i> Duplicate your image layer.  You can do this quickly by holding "Ctrl" and pressing "J", or go to the top of your screen, click "Layer",  and choose "Duplicate Layer".
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 3:</i> With your <b>top</b> layer highlighted, go to the top of your screen, click "Filter", go down to "Blur", and choose "Gaussian Blur".  A screen should pop up.  I usually set the blur radius to 2.0 pixels, but feel free to experiment!
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_2.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 4:</i> In your Layers screen, set the top layer (i.e. the one you just blurred) to overlay.  You should have something  like this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_4.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
At this point, you can edit the opacity or leave it as it is.  See, wasn't that simple?  One final step I like to do is merge my  layers together.  Either hold "Shift", "Ctrl", then press "E", or go to the top, choose "Layers", then click "Merge Visible".
</p>
<p>
<span class="u">ABC Extra:</span>  One thing I've noticed is that this effect can have very different outcomes depending on your original image.  For example, using this technique on a very light or brightly coloured image makes it look <b>way</b> too bright and eye-straining.  On the other hand, if your image is very dark, then using this "blur" method makes it seem ever darker.  Here are examples of "light" and "dark" images:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/games/new_tradingcards/lg_blizzard_2006.gif" style="padding: 3px;" width="100" height="50"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/new_tradingcards/lg_lord_darigan.gif" style="padding: 3px;" width="100" height="50"></center>
<p>
As an "experiment", you can try using the blur technique on the images above to see what I mean.
<br></p>
<h3>Tutorial: Editing the colours</h3>
Since this isn't supposed to be an in-depth guide on colouring, I won't go into things like curves and other intermediate techniques.  However, there is an easy way to play around with the colours of your image.
<p>
<i>Step 1:</i> We're continuing straight from the previous tutorial with this button here:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_4.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
At the top of your screen, click "Image", go down to "Adjustments", then click "Color Balance".  A quicker method is to hold "Ctrl" and press "B".
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 2:</i> A screen should pop up.  Play around with the levers until you're satisfied with the colours of your button base.  For this example, I want to make my button base a bit more dramatic and emphasize the red shades.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_5.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_6.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
And that's it!  Here's a "before and after" look:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_4.png" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_7.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
On the other hand, what if I wanted a retro-inspired look?  I would emphasize green/blue tones, resulting in this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_8.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Adding textures and other fun stuff</h2>
While the button can certainly be considered finished, some button makers like to go a step further and add some textures or patterns to help accent their base image.  One of my favourite types of textures is <i>bokeh</i> or <i>light</i> textures.  These can really make your button shine!  Continuing from the previous tutorial, I'll be using that scorchio button.  The texture I'll be using is from <a href="/~liahness">Details</a> and can be seen below:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<a href="/~MrDoedel"><img src="http://i1116.photobucket.com/albums/k573/nienkju4/lt30.jpg" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="100" border="0" title="Texture from Details"></a>
</center>
<p>
<span class="u">ABC Extra:</span> You don't "need" textures!  If you think your button looks better without one, then that's fine!
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_7.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
For the example above, I'll be trying to position the texture so that the stars appear in the <b>empty areas</b> of the button (i.e. the upper half of the right side, above the stream of fire).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Tutorial: Applying bokeh textures</h3>
<i>Step 1:</i> Open up your button base image in Photoshop.  Copy and paste your bokeh layer <b>above</b> your image layer.  Set your bokeh (or texture) layer to screen.
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_9.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 2:</i> Remember the tutorial where we re-sized the grarrl image?  That's what we're going to do here.  With your bokeh layer highlighted, hold Ctrl and press "T".  From there, make the bokeh image a bit smaller and move it around so you get a sense of where the "stars" are.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 3:</i> After doing that, I'm left with something like this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_10.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
You <b>can</b> leave it at this but I'm super picky and even if it's a pixel out of place, I'm still going to edit it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 4:</i> I don't like how there's a "star" in the top left corner.  Sure, it seems like a small issue, but at this point I'm not sure what border I'm going to use.  It's best if I just deal with any imperfections now, rather than later.  There are two ways I can edit the texture.  Remember in an earlier tutorial where I applied a gradient mask to "fade" the grarrl image? I can do that here as well.  However, here's a much quicker and easier way.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_11-1.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
After clicking on that corner with my eraser two or three times, I have this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_12.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
It might be the case that the border design I choose would have covered that area anyway.  Still, I like to perfect a base <b>before</b> because sometimes the requester may ask me to use a different one instead.
</p>
<p>
Let's compare the "before" and "after" versions:
</p>
<p>

As you can see, the bokeh we added works very nicely because it makes use of otherwise empty space.  The stars add a nice effect.  As an interesting <b>side effect</b>, notice the colours of our button base.  It seems a bit bright and more orange.  If I wanted to keep the deep colour tones of the first button, I could have gone and lowered the opacity of the bokeh layer (I usually lower bokeh to around 80%).  For this tutorial, I left it at 100% to show the unintended colour change. That's why experimenting with many different textures is a good idea!
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Tutorial: Adding scanlines</h3>
Let's rewind a bit.  What if you wanted to add scan lines or a repeating pattern instead of a texture?  Here's how I go about doing that.
<p>
<i>Step 1:</i>  We'll be using the unedited version of the scorchio button (the one prior to the bokeh addition):
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_7.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
For this tutorial, I'll be using a white diagonal scan line.  Open up your button base in Photohop, and make a <b>new layer</b> above your image.  You can do this by going to the top of the screen, click on "Layer", select "New Layer", then press "Okay".  Fill this new layer with your pattern.  This is what I have so far:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_13.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<span class="u">ABC Extra:</span> You can get premade scan lines from a variety of places.  <a href="/~singlerain">Create Impressions</a> has one in the "button resources" section near the top.  In this tutorial, I used a Paint Bucket and set the "fill" to "Pattern" because I have a pack of scan lines downloaded into my program.  If you want to learn how to <b>make your own scan lines</b> in Photoshop, click <a href="#scanlines">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 2:</i> Set the layer with your scan lines to <b>soft light</b>.  My button now looks like this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_14.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 3:</i> Yeah, that's not a good-looking button at all. The scan lines are so harsh and obvious!  Let's blend it into our button base, shall we?  Again, we're going to use the gradient layer mask method (refer back to the tutorial where we faded the grarrl's wing).
</p>
<p>
Since I've already used this step before, I won't go into major detail, but here's a refresher.
Add a layer mask to your scan line layer.  From there, make sure your foreground and background colour is black and white, respectively.  Choose the "gradient tool".  For this button, I'll start my gradient on the far left side and drag my line towards the right side.
</p>
<p>
Here's what I have:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_15.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
With scan lines, you never want them to overlap your focal image.  This makes them look strange and out of focus.  Instead, confine your scan lines to empty areas.  In this example, the empty areas are on the right side.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 4:</i>  The scan lines are still too harsh.  I'm going to lower the opacity a bit to 77%.  Finally, I have this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_16.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
With scan lines, what you're trying to do is help add some charactertics or details to your button base.  You're <b>not</b> trying to cover anything and you especially don't want the scan lines to cover your focal image.  It makes it look low-quality.
</p>
<p>
The scan lines in the image above are still a bit on the harsh side.  I'd probably lower it even further to 50%.
<br></p>
<h2>Using lighting effects to your advantage</h2>
While you can use light and bokeh textures to add some shine to your button base, there's a very simple technique you can do that allows you to <b>control</b> the "shine" itself.  Check out the <a href="/~la_roque#shine">shine tutorial at The Lunch Box</a>.  Here's a before and after look:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_7.png" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_17.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
In the second example, I used a brush and drew a wavy line in the area above the flame (this is done in a new layer above the button base).  I set that layer to "overlay" and lowered the opacity to around 65%.  If you don't have any suitable premade textures on hand, this technique is an extremely easy way to add some nice highlights to your base.
<br></p>
<h2>With textures, less is more!</h2>
Button bases are these tiny 88 by 31 pixel images, so be sure that you're not piling on textures and patterns without thinking about what they're adding to your base.  Ask yourself whether you <b>need</b> to use scan lines and be sure that if someone asks you why you used it, you can answer that question.  In the tutorials above, I used the star bokeh texture because I wanted to add some nice accents to the empty areas.  The same can be said about the scan lines.  With the "shine" effect, I did that in order to put more emphasis in that area.
<p>
Using scan lines <b>and</b> the bokeh texture <b>and</b> the shine effect was too much.  It made my button base look way too messy.  From here on out, I'll just use the bokeh texture.

</p>
<h2>Stay away from "neon" and super bright colours</h2>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/waytoobright.png" style="padding: 7px; float: right;">
How bright is <i>too</i> bright?  Your button is meant to attract people to visit a certain site, not drive them away because your button is a mixture of bright yellows, harsh reds, and neon greens!  Take a look at these two buttons.  Both of them are super bright (almost white).  The colours are very "neon" and eye-straining.  Poor colour choices can make your button look very low-quality, but more importantly, bright colours make your text harder to read.
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/waytoobright2.png" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/waytoobright3.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
While editing colours and applying textures, keep a close eye on your button base.  Sometimes, your button might seem too bright and eye-straining.  This is <b>not</b> a good way to finish off your button because it doesn't look very attractive.  That's not to say that you "have" to use dark colours only, but use some common sense when editing colours and do your best to stay away from "neon" colours that are just way too intense.  For example,  <font color="94F9DC">94F9DC</font>,  <font color="FFFF78">FFFF78</font>, and  <font color="A0FF68">A0FF68</font> are <b>not</b> good colours for your button (for those of you who are curious, the colours are #94F9DC, #FFFF78, and #A0FF68).
</p>
<p>
Take a look at the panel of colours on your right.  Using the eyedropper tool in Photoshop, these are colours that I grabbed off of buttons that are <b>way</b> too bright.  These were the dominant or main colours on the button, and I couldn't stand more than a passing glance because the "neon" palette was just so strong.  
</p>
<p>
Now, don't mistake <b>bright</b> for <b>light</b>.  The brightness of a colour means we're talking about how strong or intense it is.  The brighter the colour (like a neon green), the more tacky and eye-straining your button will look.  


<br></p>
<h2>Final tips:</h2>
<p>
- I sharpen and use the "dreamy" effect for a <b>lot</b> of my graphics, buttons, and layouts.  It's such a common process that I made a <i>Photoshop action</i> to speed up the process.    
Pressing a single button goes through each step of sharpening, blurring, and merging my layers.
</p>
<p>
- Part of creating a unique button is being able to experiment.  Here are some examples of "before" (the image has been cropped) and "after" (the image has been edited).  Some stay on the simple side, while others get really creative!

<h1>Ch 5: Borders</h1>
While borders may seem like an "add on" or something that's not very crucial, it's actually a very important step.  What borders do is help <b>frame</b> your button base.  In certain cases, some border styles might even help direct the viewer's attention to specific parts of a button.  
<br><h2>Parts of a border</h2>
For the majority of borders, you'll have a dark "outer" border and a white "inner" border.  In the visual example below, the borders have been scaled up so that you can make out the tiny details.  The red line points to the outer border while the blue line points to the inner border.
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_1.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
A border is more than just a rectangular square.  Now, it can be all sorts of different styles!  One of the fun part about owning a button request site is taking time to create totally unique borders.  Take a look at some I've created over at <a href="/~Interstade#custom">Open Eyes</a>.
<br></p>
<h2>Creating your borders</h2>
<a href="/~interstade"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/OpenEyes/cloudy.png" border="0" style="padding: 3px; float: right;"></a>
As a button maker, you should <i>respect</i> your fellow button makers and stay away from tracing over their borders.  Even if it's something as simple as a "cloud" border, draw it by hand yourself.  When I first started making buttons, I had a list of border styles I liked.  Other sites were using the neat "cloud" border so what I did was open up a blank 88 by 31 pixel screen in Photoshop, and started to draw it.  I did <i>not</i> use any other border as a reference (for instance, I didn't say "well, this site's cloudy border has three pixels in the top, then they go down one pixel, then inwards two pixels").  I just started with the concept (i.e. a cloudy shape) and went from there.  It took a lot of trial and error since I wanted to make each side even, but in the end I got it to work!
<p>
While using popular border designs isn't a bad thing, why not go a step further and design your own border from scratch?   Here are some that I've created myself:
</p>
<p>
</p>

</center>
<p>
Completely original button borders may be hard to come up with, but it's very satisfying when you <i>do</i> offer something unique.  It'll make your buttons stand out from the crowd!
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>The importance of the inner border</h2>
It may seem strange that such as small aspect of the button can make it feel completely unfinished, but that's the case here.  A white border helps accentuate your outer border while helping it frame your button base.
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_2.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Some border styles don't use a white inner border, such as these:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/OpenEyes/bricks.png" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/OpenEyes/shadow.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
When creating your button borders from scratch, make sure that the white inner border lines up appropriately with the darker outer border.

<br><h3>Tutorial: Adding a border</h3>
<span class="u">ABC Extra:</span> You may want to check out the <a href="#makingborders">border making</a> tutorial first.
<p>
<i>Step 1:</i> Open up a new screen and make it 88 pixels in width and 31 pixels in height.  The <b>most important</b> thing to remember is to set the screen to "transparent" as indicated in the screenshot below.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_4.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 2:</i> For this tutorial, I'll be using this image:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/edit_12.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 3:</i> Open up your file that contains your border.  If you don't have a border ready to go, you'll have to create yours from scratch (see <a href="#makingborders">here</a>).  For this tutorial, I already have a file with a border I'll be using.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_11.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
With my border screen selected, hold "Ctrl" and press "A" to select your entire layer.  Alternatively, you can go to the top of your menu, click "Select", "Load Selection", then press "OK".
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_12.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
While your layer is selected, hold "Ctrl" and press "C" to copy your  layer.  Alternatively, you can go to "Edit" at the top, and click "Copy".
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 4:</i> 
Click on the screen that has your button base.  Hold "Ctrl" and press "V" to paste your border.  Make sure that the layer with the border is at the very top.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_13.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 5:</i> 
Repeat the same process for the black outer border.  Click on the screen that has your border and highlight the layer that has the outer border.  Select it all, copy it, then click on the screen that has your button base and paste it there.  Again, make sure it's at the very top.  This is what you should have so far.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_14.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 6:</i>
From this step forward, I won't be using the screen with the border anymore so I've closed that.  The button border I've selected requires me to delete some of the edges to make it transparent.  To make things easier on yourself, let's zoom in.  At the bottom left corner of your screen, you should see something like this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/scan_2.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
I've set mine to 1600%.  In the "tools" screen, select the "Eraser".  If your icon looks different than the one in the example below, right-click on the image and select the correct  eraser icon.  After doing that, you should see "Mode" pop up at the top of your -blocked-  We'll need to set it to "Block" because we want our eraser edge to be completely straight.  
</p>
<p>
After making sure that your image is selected (in the layers screen, it'll be highlighted in blue; you can always click your layer to choose it if it's not already highlighted).  Using the black outer border as a guideline, carefully erase bits of your image.  Don't go overtop of the black border, just erase anything <b>outside</b> of it.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_15.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 7:</i> 
Repeat this erasing process anywhere it's needed.  For example, if you're using a "cloud" border, you'll have a ton of pockets to erase since it runs around the button.  On the other hand, a border style like "three singles" is super easy.  There's no area you need to erase!
</p>
<p>
</p>

<p>
After erasing everything, you should have something like this (note the curved corners):
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_16.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 8:</i> 
We're definitely not leaving our border like that as it doesn't match our colour palette.  Plus, it's a bit on the unattractive side, isn't it?  There's so many things you can do with border styling!  You can see a couple techniques in <a href="#styleborders">this tutorial</a>.
</p>
<p>
After some editing, I have this:

<p>
</p>

<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_25-1.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<br><h2>Final tips</h2>
- Having a "white inner border" doesn't mean it <i>has</i> to be white.  What I like to do is set the opacity of the white inner border around 60-80%.  This gives the inner border a nice faded effect.  Also, to have that nice "neon" look that some buttons have, you can set your white inner border to "overlay".  This works best with dark images.  Of course, if it's too "bright", you can lower the opacity (I tend to put around 70-80% opacity with overlay).  
<p>
Here's an example of all three "types".  In the first, the white inner border has no fade or layer effect.  It's simply a full 100% opacity white border.  In the second example, the white inner layer has been faded a bit as I lowered the opacity.  In the third example, the white layer has been set to overlay.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/signaturefonts.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/oe1.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/promise.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
I personally think of them like this.  If I want a simplistic button, I use a 100% white border.  To make the button 
look softer (perhaps becuause of the theme or the bold colours), I lower the opacity.  For a "neon" look that's bright 
and eye-catching, I set it to overlay.

<h1>CH 6: ADDING TEXT</h1>
Now that you have a spiffy button with a border added to it, one of the last things you need to do is add text.  

<h2>Should I choose a "large" font or a small font?</h2>
The answer to this question depends on a few things.

<p>
<b>The area you have to devote to text</b>
</p>
<p>
As I said in a previous chapter, I like having 50% of the button space available for text.  Depending on whether or not you've chosen a focal image, your button may have more or less room.  Here are some examples:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/rileysport.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
This is what I mean by a 50/50 split between the focal image and the area the text sits.  
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/calibre_2.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Here, the focal image is a bit small so the text takes up about 70% of the button space.  
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/heathersport.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Here, the "50/50" split is horizontal.  The focal image stretches across the top, leaving the bottom half for the text.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/alliance.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
There's no focal point here, so the text has 100% of the button space.
</p>
<p>
In general, the larger the area you have for your text, the better the "large" font used will look.  In the scorchio button I've been using through this guide, there's a rough 50/50 split of focal image versus text space.  This ratio is very common so I'll be using it for this step.  Suppose someone requested from me and wants me to write "Turnip's Button" on the button. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_3.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
The most common mistake that new button makers do is try to use large font.  The font above looks very unappealing because the word "Turnip's" just isn't large enough.  What if we tried a different font?
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/popshop.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
In the example above, I used a font called Bubblegum.  Even at smaller font sizes, the thickness of the font design allows for easy reading. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_4.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
While this text could look fantastic with some additional styling, it's <b>covering the focal image</b>, which is bad.  Looks like we're back to the drawing board because the button above looks very low-quality.
</p>
<p>
After trying a few other large fonts, it just doesn't seem to work.  Sometimes, it's best to use a small font.  While the "fad" these days is to use large fonts because they look stylish, why should your button quality suffer?  Text should first and foremost be <b>functional</b>.
</p>

In the example above, the word "Turnip's" is written in a small font called Bangalore.  It's one of the larger small fonts and judging by the button above, it's not a good choice either.  The text is still covering parts of the focal image.
</p>
<p>
</p>

<p>
You know what?  Simple <i>works</i>.  Sure, the font isn't fancy but not only is it easy to read, it works well within the space you have.  Why bother having a focal image if you're going to cover it up with text?  Here are some examples where I've used large fonts:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/atthebakery_2.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/aqua.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/moonless_2.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Note that in every example, I have a large amount of space available for text design (more than 50% of the button space). <b>Because</b> I have the space available, I chose to write the text using a large font.  <b>Don't</b> go into a button thinking "I'm going to use large font" without analyzing your button base and text first.
</p>
<p>
<b>The text you intend to write</b>
</p>
<p>
You're definitely not going to want to write "Turnip's Link Directory of Button Sites" in large font because that's just silly.  There's no way you'll have enough room to even write "Directory of Button Sites"!  With large fonts, I tend to use them for single site names or to emphasize a particular word.  Take these for example:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/creativeflow.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/katesport.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/selenasport.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
In all of the examples above, the site names are not "single" names (i.e. there's more than one word).  However, I use large font to emphasize the more important part of the name.  
</p>
<p>
If you desperately want to use large fonts for one reason or another, here's a way you can squeeze them in:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/minutiae.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/pixiedust_3.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
By limiting the "large" font to a single letter or two, you can add a lot of style to your text design.
</p>
<h2>Small fonts</h2>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_27.png" style="padding: 3px; float: left;"></center>
<p>
That's a list of the more popular small fonts.  The font <i>name</i> is written in all capitals, and the word "Example!" is written in sentence case.  I've also provided the size I use when writing with specific fonts.
</p>
<p>
<b>Here are some quick tips:</b>
</p>
<p>
- When you choose the "text" tool, make sure that your <i>anti-aliasing method</i> is set to "none". You can find this option at the top of your window next to your font size option.
<br>
- If you want to use a small font on the larger side, Awesome and Bangalore are both excellent choices.  Awesome has a larger width (i.e. thickness to the font) and I find it works extremely well if you want to do a colour gradient.
<br>
- Have a <b>ton</b> of text?  Wendy is a suitable choice.  It's on the smaller side so you'll have to be careful when styling the text in order to make it easier to read.
<br>
- Why use just one small font?  Take a look at the bottom two examples (the ones that say "A Button Collection").  In the first example, the letters A, B, and C are written in Bangalore and the rest in Silkscreen.  In the second example, the letters are written with Pixel-Love and the rest in 04b03.
<br>
- Try to stay away from using <i>only</i> cursive small fonts (like writing your entire text in Pixel-love).  It can get hard to read.
<br>
- <b>Always</b> capitalize every single letter of your small font.  For example, if a requester wants the text "Turnip's Portfolio", you'd write "TURNIP'S PORTFOLIO" in whatever 
small font you choose.  The need for all capitals is due to the fact that the text will be easier to read and it'll stand out much more.  Especially with fonts like Bangalore, writing in normal 
sentence case makes it harder to read because of the font style.
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_29.png" style="padding: 3px; float: left;">
In the visual example to your left, I have three sets of buttons.  The text used in the first row is Bangalore, the text used in the second row is 04b03, and the bottom row uses Pixel-love.  In each set, the first button uses normal sentence case and the second button uses all capitals.
</p>
<p>
Capitalizing the entire word just makes it much more visible and easy to read.
</p>
<p>
Remember when I advised you to stay away from cursive small fonts?  The first button example in rows one and three both have a major issue: text readability is low.
</p>
<p>
<span class="u">ABC Extra:</span> With Pixel-love, I like using it as the first letter in a site name (like <b>A</b> <b>B</b>utton <b>C</b>ollection).  This gives the text a bit more style without hurting its clarity.
<br></p>
<h2>Large fonts</h2>
I always get asked what type of fonts I use so here's a short list!
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_28.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
These are some of my absolute favourite fonts to use on buttons.  Some, however, are easier than others.  Be very careful about using cursive fonts like Wendy Medium.  The font is on the thin side and has no weight, meaning that you need to make the font size larger in order to make it easy to read.  Take a look at this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/melliesport_2.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Normally, I wouldn't use cursive font in this case because I had a lack of vertical space and the there was a lot that needed to be written.  Since this was requested by a user, this is absolutely the smallest I would go in terms of font size.  Cursive fonts tend to look much more appealing when they're written very large anyways.  Take a look at these:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/able_2.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/demure_2.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><p>
</p>
</center>
<span class="u">ABC Extra:</span> If I'm using a texture background (i.e. my button doesn't have a focal image), I love using cursive fonts since I have a ton of space to work with.
<p>
<b>Here are some quick tips:</b>
</p>
<p>
- Don't want to download new fonts?  That's fine!  There are a lot of generic fonts I use that should have come pre-downloaded on your computer.  Look for fonts like Impact, Century Gothic, Times New Roman, and Georgia.
<br>
- When you choose the "text" tool, make sure that your <i>anti-aliasing method</i> is set to "crisp". You can find this option at the top of your window next to your font size option.
<br>
- If you're completely new to using large fonts, try to experiment with the easier styles first, like Okuda and Headline.  These are similar to Sans serif fonts due to the fact that they're more "normal".  From there, perhaps move on to a slightly more decorative font, like Hand of Sean or Happi.  I would only recommend using cursive fonts like Wendy Medium after you know what you're actually doing.
<br>
- Want to <b>save space</b> when using a large font?  Simple!  Don't capitalize any of the letters or site name. If you look at the example above, both the site names "able" and "demure" are written in lower case.  
<br>
- With thinner fonts, I like to duplicate the font layer to "beef" it up a bit.  This adds a small amount of "weight" to the font, meaning it'll be more visible.  Sometimes you might get jagged edges when duplicating your font layer so be careful.  Experiment and lower the opacity of your duplicated font layer.

</p>
<h3>Tutorial: Adding text to your button</h3>
<i>Step 1:</i> Open up your blank button in Photoshop.  I'll be using this one here:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_25-1.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Since I'm making a link back button for this site, I'll be adding the text "A Button Collection".  This won't be an easy task since this site name is on the long side.  Still, let's continue.  In the "tools" screen, click on the "T" icon as indicated in the red square below.  
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_7.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
For this button, I'll be using the font called <b>0b403</b>, a very popular <b>small</b> font.  I want each of the words in my site name to go on a separate line, like this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
A
<br>
Button
<br>
Collection
</center>
<p>
To do this, I'm going to select the "Type" tool (i.e. the "T" icon), click on the button base, and type "A".  When I'm finished, I click the "checkmark" symbol indicated in the screenshot below.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_8.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
I click in an area beneath the "A" and type in "BUTTON" (in capitals).  I repeat this process for the word "COLLECTION".  After moving each layer so that it's somewhat centered, here's what I have:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_9.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 2:</i> 
After all of the text is on the button, actually <b>look</b> at it to see if it's visually appealing.  Here, the word "collection" is a bit large.  It's almost touching the focal image and the right border.  I think I'll change the font to a smaller "small" font, such as Wendy and see how it looks.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_10.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Well, the word "collection" is definitely smaller, but I think I'm going to go ahead and change all of the other words to the same font, just to keep things symmetrical.  As you can see, text is one of the more fickle aspects of buttons.  If one font doesn't work or doesn't look appealing, change it right away!
</p>
<p>
Here's what I have:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_11.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
The new font is called "Wendy" is as you can probably see, it's bordering on tiny!  However, this is the smallest you can go and after I'm done with styling, it should be very readable.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 3:</i> 
In your Layers screen, make all of the layers invisible <b>except</b> your text layers.  You can do this by clicking the "eye" symbol beside each layer.  
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_12.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 4:</i> 
Highlighting one of the text layers (it doesn't matter which one), hold the "shift" and "Ctrl" keys, then press "E" to merge the visible layers (or go to "Layers" at the top and choose "Merge Visible").
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_13.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
In the example images, just ignore the last two layers (i.e. layers 5 and 4).  Those were the scan lines and shine layers from previous tutorials.
</p>
<p>
And that's it!  In the next section, we'll be <b>styling</b> our text because we definitely don't want to leave it plain old black! 
<br></p>
<h2>Text placement</h2>
Not only do your font choices matter, but <b>where</b> you put your text on the button base is crucial.  It can be the difference between a button that looks messy, complicated, and unorganized, or one that looks tidy and high-quality.  Take a look at the visual below:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/placement_1.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
In the first button on the left, I used Bangalore.  This was <b>not</b> a good choice because it's quite a large font.  I switched to 04b03, but notice how it's still covering parts of the focal image.  The bottom button example shows a much better use of space.  Note how none of the text covers the facial area.  The text is relegated to the empty areas of the button.
</p>
<p>
 Also, the text has been aligned to the right.  If you notice the left side of the text, it looks like it's curving around the petpet's face.   
</p>
<p>
To set different alignments to your text, take a look at the screenshot below.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/placement_2.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
The three options are align to the left, center, and align to the right.
</p>
<p>
<span class="u">ABC Extra:</span> In the third button example, do you see the top right area of the button?  It's completely empty so I may want to put an animation there (for instance, a sparkle animation would be a great use of space).  Here's an example:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/chrysalis.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><p>
</p>
</center>
In the Chrysalis button above, each aspect of the button has its own specific spatial area.  The focal image is on the left, the text placement is the top right corner, and the animation plays out in the empty space below that.
<p>
While the second button example (the one where the "Neopets Directory" is only slightly covering the focal image) isn't completely unusable, it's best to make sure that your focal image isn't covered by anything just to be on the safe side.
</p>
<p>
For focal images that are on the far left or right, text placement will be easy.  Take a look at these examples:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/magnet.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/esteem.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/sweeters_3.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
On the other hand, what if your focal image <b>isn't</b> easily defined?  Here are some that uses different text placement than the ones above:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/retouch.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/signaturefonts.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/sincerelyyours.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
For Retouch's button, the focal image is the row of roses at the bottom.  Thus, the text placement is above it.  The same situation can be seen in the second button.  For the third button, the focal image is quite large (it's the character writing in the journal).  The text placement is placed in the very top corner.
</p>
<p>
<b>Are you using a textured/patterned background?</b>
</p>
<p>
Here are some examples of buttons that do not have an image focal point:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/alliance.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/treasuretrove.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/flux.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
What's interesting to keep in mind is that all of the text placement is centered.  This is because there is <i>no</i> image focal point.  For example, take a look at the first button.  If the word "Alliance" was placed on the far right of the button, this implies that there's a focal point on the left.  There isn't one because the background is a textured background.  
</p>
<p>
When using textured backgrounds, putting text in the middle helps emphasize it much more.  It's also aesthetically appealing because of the symmetry. 
</p>
<p>
If using a simple patterned background or texture, putting the text anywhere besides the center can look a bit strange.  Here's an example:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<a href="/~la_roque"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/TLB/Resources/bh116.png" style="padding: 3px;" border="0"></a>
<a><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/TLB/Resources/bh105.png" style="padding: 3px;" border="0"></a>
</center>
<p>
With buttons <b>text is the most important thing</b> (I'll probably repeat this over and over again throughout the guide).  What's the purpose of a button?  To advertise your site.  For the examples above, the point isn't to advertise a site, but to add a bit of design to a page (i.e. colourful placeholders).  If the blue example was a button for a site, however, note how much <i>empty space</i> there is.  The text isn't as noticeable but a larger problem is that it just looks a bit dull.  The purple example is much better since the text is centered. Note how it's the very first thing you see when you glance at it.  Also, the patterned background is <i>accenting</i> the text, rather than becoming the focal point.


<br></p>
<h2>Final tips:</h2>
- The <i>anti-aliasing</i> mode is extremely important!  If you're using a large font, then your AA should 
<i>not</i> be set to "none" (personally, I like setting large fonts to "crisp").  If you're using a small font, 
then the AA should be set to "none".  How do you fine the anti-aliasing option?  When you've selected your 
Type Tool, look at the top of your screen.  The AA is highlighted in the red box below:

<h1>CH 7: STYLING TEXT</h1>


Here's another one of those "aw, it's so easy.  Why should I pay attention to it?" categories.  If you only take one thing away from this guide, it should be this: <b>text is the most important aspect of a button</b>.  Nothing else matters nearly as much.  A button is meant to advertise a site and it can't do that very well if the text is unattractive and hard to read.  What new button makers often do right away is make the jump to "large" fonts without perfecting their "small font" technique.  This is a <b>major error</b> and it's often the #1 reason why a button will look low-quality.
<p>
Time to go back into the vault and pull out some of my earlier buttons.  At the time, I was super proud of these but looking back on them, I cringe a bit inside.  As a new button maker, my focus was too much on making the button look "pretty" rather than making it look polished and finished.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Single coloured border</h2>
Probably the most common button technique is to outline the white-coloured text with a single coloured, 1 pixel border.  Here are some examples:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/erised_3.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/buildingblocks-1.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Simple, but effective.  If you have a super colourful button base, using white text will help make it stand out.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Gradient overlay</h2>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j259/thelayoutdesign/TLB/Buttons/button2.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
In the example above, a gradient overlay was applied to the text.  However, it's not very effective.  It makes the text look harder to read because the border isn't a strong colour.  If you want to apply a gradient to your text, I suggest using white and another very light colour.  Here are some examples:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/erised_4.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/allofthecupcakes_4.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
In both examples above, the text has been treated with a gradient overlay.  In the first, I chose white as the "main" colour and I used the eyedropper tool to grab a purple tone from the button base.  However, I edited the purple colour selection and made it extremely light, going from the original colour of <font color="BA5675 ">#BA5675 </font> to <font color="F2E0E5">#F2E0E5</font> (or #F2E0E5 since that colour is hard to read).  The idea is to create enough of an effect that it's noticeable, but not strong enough to make the text overlay dark and hard to read.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>White as the outer border</h2>
In rare cases, you may want to have coloured text with a white outer border (rather than the common white text and coloured border).  This is a bit of an advanced method and I wouldn't recommend new button makers do this.  It's not so much the technique that's hard, but how it's used.  Here are some examples:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/yeppeo.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/daybreak.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/shiawase_2.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
When using a white border, you have to carefully maintain a thin balance between text readability and button aesthetics.  With buttons that have much darker images, using a white border will make the edges of the text stand out so that it looks really low-quality and awkward, like this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_1.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
The colours of this button are on the darker side, so choosing a white border isn't the best choice.  The edges look jagged and the text style isn't visually appealing.  On the other hand:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_2.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Using a coloured outer border makes the white text stand out much more in this case.
</p>
<p>
My general rule of thumb is that white borders look best (and can be used) with button bases that are light in colour (for example, the Yeppeo button above).  With a base image that is darker, white stands out way too much.

</p>
<p>
<span class="u">ABC Extra:</span> With new button makers, I always recommend they perfect the first text style option (white text with single pixel, solid colour border) before moving on to other techniques that require a more careful eye.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Using white stripes</h2>
If your button base image is on the busy or colourful side, using a white stripe behind your text can improve visibility and readability.  Here are some examples:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/wazzled.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/inthespotlight.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
In the first example, the white stripe is at 100%, while in the second button the opacity has been lowered by about 15%.  With white stripes, be careful that you don't fade it too much (the second button works because the colour of the text is dark and easy to read anyways).
</p>
<h3>Tutorial: Add some style to your text!</h3>
<i>Step 1:</i> We'll be using this button from previous tutorials.
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_11.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
As you can see, the text definitely needs some sprucing up.  It's very plain and low-quality right now.  With your text layer selected (it should be highlighted in blue in the Layers screen), go to the bottom and click on this symbol:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_14.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
From the menu that pops up, select "Color Overlay".  Click the coloured square indicated in the red box.  Once you click that, a new screen should appear called "Color Picker".  I want my text to be white in colour, so I'm going to click in the area indicated by the red arrow.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_15.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 2:</i>
That results in this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_16.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Let's put a nice solid border around our text.  If you look at our Layers screen, notice that the "Color Overlay" style has been added to the text layer.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_17.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
To quickly bring up the style menu, double click on "Color Overlay" and the previous "Layer style" screen should come up.  This time, click on "Stroke" near the bottom.  Set the "size" to 1 pixel.  In the "Fill Type" option, click on the coloured square.  This should turn your cursor into an eyedropper.  Use the eyedropper to pick a suitable colour from your button base.  In the example below, I've chosen a nice brown shade.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_18.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<span class="u">ABC Extra:</span> I try to position the screen with my button in an area where it won't be overlapped by the new screens.  This allows me to see the button and click on it to get the colour I want.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_19.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 3:</i> 
While the border makes the text easier to read, it stills needs a lot of work.  Let's add a shadow to the text to help make it "pop".  Again, click "Color Overlay" in your Layers window, bringing up the Layer Style screen again.  This time, we'll be choosing Drop Shadow.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_20.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
The default colour of your shadow is black.  To help blend the text in with the button, I've changed it to a very dark brown (make sure your shadow colour isn't too light or the shadow won't be very substantial).  For the "opacity", play around with the setting.  Some lighter buttons require a lower opacity since you don't want your shadow to be harsh or obvious.  Here, I've lowered it from 75% to 60%.  
</p>
<p>
In addition, I changed the angle of the drop shadow so that it drops in the opposite direction (the shadow now lies on the left side rather than near the bottom right).  The rest of the settings work generally well, so you don't have to change them if you don't want to.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 4:</i> 
One last step I'm going to do in terms of layer style is add a soft <b>glow</b>.  In your Layers screen, double click on "Color Overlay" to quickly bring up the Layer Style screen, then choose "Outer Glow".
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_21.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
The default colour of the outer glow is this neon yellow.  While it certainly gets the job done in adding a nice glow, let's customize it and make it match our button base colours.  I've changed it to orange (remember that to change the colour, you just need to click on the coloured square to bring up the "Color Picker" window).
 </p>
<p>
Here's what we have so far:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_22.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 5:</i> 
While you can leave the button like that, the text looks like it could use a bit more work.  Create a <b>new layer</b> below the text layer.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_23.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 6:</i> 
Go back and select the <b>text</b> layer (it should be highlighted blue in the Layers window). At the top, click "Select", "Load Selection", then "OK".  This should select your text layer (i.e. only the words themselves).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_24.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 7:</i>
While your text layer is being selected, go back and click on the empty layer that was created earlier.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_25.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
Set your <b>Foreground color</b> (i.e. the large square in the Tools screen) to a colour that matches your button border.  In my case, I chose <font color="902103">#902103</font>.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 8:</i> 
Choose the "Paint Bucket" tool (or press "G" on your keyboard) and click once into the selected area.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 9:</i> 
Hold "Ctrl" and press "D" to deselect your text layer (or click "Select" at the top and "Deselect").  What we just did is create a coloured version of our text <b>under</b> the text layer.  Our next step is to blur that layer so that it creates a nice background effect for our text.  First, make sure that the bottom layer is selected.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/text_25.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
Go to the top and click "Filter", "Blur", and finally "Gaussian Blur".  I usually use a radius of 2 pixels.  Click "OK".
</p>
<p>
And finally, this is what we have:
</p>
<p>
</p>

<br><h2>Final tips:</h2>
<p>
- With text style, always make sure you're putting <b>functionality</b> before "looks".  
<br>
- There's absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to stay simple.  Don't think of the single coloured border as being too "plain" or "interesting" just because it's not as fancy as a gradient or other techniques.
<br>
- I find text design to be one of the interesting aspects of button making.  Here are some examples of how different text can look:

<h1>General Tips</h1>



<h2>Text overlap</h2>
This isn't a tutorial, more of a general guideline but hopefully you'll find something useful here.
<p>
For the most part, try to keep your text <b>off</b> of your focal image.  If the words are covering your focal image, then your button will look more messy and less polished.  Some <i>very</i> slight overlapping is OK.  Let's take a closer look:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/maddiesbanners.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/honeysport.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
In the buttons above, the the <b>face</b> is the focal point, so putting the text over the body area or the side of the head is completely fine.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/light.gif"></center>
<p>
Here, the text overlaps the border, but only slightly.  It adds something unique to the overall button.  
However, you want to be careful with overlapping because it can easily get out of hand.  If your text is <i>on top</i> of your other layers (like in the button above), then it'll have a higher chance of looking better.  If your text is <b>below</b> or under your border layers, then your text will look cut-off and lower quality.

<br><br></p>
<h2>Colouring and editing your button base</h2>
Stick to a colour palette. One of the best ways to create a visually unified button is to use colours that are found in your button base. For example, don't make your border green if there's no green shades in your base image at all.
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/OpenEyes/example3.png" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/OpenEyes/example4.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
With the first button, the border is still black. This makes it stand out a bit too much and doesn't really add any style to the button. Additionally, the text border colour is pink but there is no pink in the base image. The second button is much more unified. The dark blue colours for the border and the text are both taken directly from the button base. Everything looks more in place.

<h1>The Button Survey</h1>
Yes, this is a rather lengthy survey, but it's for a good purpose!  My goal for this survey is twofold:
<p>
First, I want to learn more about the <b>visitor's</b> perspective on button-making.  From someone who <i>doesn't</i> make buttons, what do they think is "high-quality"?  What aspects do they pay attention to the most?  
</p>
<p>
Secondly, I hope this survey helps established button-makers with improving their own quality and service at their site.
<br></p>
<h2>The survey...</h2>
<span class="u">Important!</span>  There are two separate surveys.  One is for button <b>makers</b>, 
those who own (or have owned) a button request site or those who make buttons on a frequent basis.  
Even if you do request buttons <i>and</i> make them yourself, please limit your answers to a button maker's 
perspective.
<p>
Button <b>requesters</b> refers to those who primarily request buttons and have very limited or no knowledge of button-making itself.

<i>The phrase "button maker" refers to an individual who either owns a button request site or makes buttons frequently.  "Button requester" is someone who does not make buttons.</i>
<br><br></p>
<h1>Button makers</h1> 
<br><center>
<h2> <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=trubiekatie">Kate</a> (button maker)</h2>
<div style="padding: 4px; overflow: auto; text-align: left; width: 500px; height: 150px; line-height: 15px;">
1) About 6 months or so, but very on and off. I got into a big faze, then stopped, then started again around in November/December 2012.
<p>
2) Yes. I opened Oasis on December 27th, 2012 and it's currently still open.
</p>
<p>
3) Quality (5), Satisfaction (4), Speed (3), Communication (2), Convenience (1)
</p>
<p>
4) 5
</p>
<p>
5) I think a high-quality service encompasses a very user-friendly site, with on-time and consistent 
delivery. Nothing is more frustrating to requesters when they expect something and it's not delivered. If 
complications arise, they should be communicated immediately. I also think that how frequently 
requests are open is a huge part! If the site has requests perpetually closed, are they really offering a 
good service? I'd argue no - there is no service at this point. Your requesters wait and are unsure as to 
when they will ever be given the chance.
</p>
<p>
6) I think most differentiate between and high and low button quality, but not the service. Many, however, 
sacrifice good service for a good quality button.
</p>
<p>
7) I think out of something like 40 requests, I've had about 5 people fail that part of the trick.
</p>
<p>
8) Rules: sometimes
Credit: rarely
Theft: none (but I've noticed similar buttons, which is a bit frustrating)
Unused: often+ (I wouldn't say all the time, but very frequently)
</p>
<p>
9) 5
</p>
<p>
10) Once every two weeks and take many, or small batches once a week (1:5, 2:9/10)
</p>
<p>
11) 5. With school it can be tough, but I know people wait and I don't think it's fair to them.
</p>
<p>
12) Requesters should never ask if requests are closed if the signage says otherwise. That really irks the 
button makers. On the flip side, button makers shouldn't be choosy (and I can be bad for this). Some 
requests are simply just not as fun as others. That shouldn't make the quality suffer because you want
 to move on - stop, take your time, and do a great job on the button anyway.
</p>
<p>
13) 5
</p>
<p>
14) Good text placement, good font choice, appropriate border, appropriate and not-over powering 
animation, a matching colour palette, unique designs (not just seeing one button and doing a very 
similar overall design), delays between animations and effective use of cropping/space.
</p>
<p>
15) For the most part, yes. Requesters flock to certain sites because they are perceived or are very high 
quality buttons. But for the most part, these sites are full of requests or have closed requests, so they 
choose the lower quality due to its availability.
</p>
<p>
16) Text clarity (6), Text styling (4), Image clarity (7), Border (1), Animation (5), Image editing (2), Cropping (3)
</p>
<p>
17) Text clarity (6), Text styling (4), Image clarity (7), Border (1), Animation (5), Image editing (2), Cropping (3)
</p>
<p>
18) Animation 
</p>
<p>
19) No pause between animation and animations that exceed the borders stand out in my mind.
</p>
<p>
20) Image clarity - if you use an image as the base and you can't tell what it is, what was the point? 
This is really hard to decide though. I think buttons really do need every aspect.
</p>
<p>
21) I had one a long time ago and I thought it was hideous. A lot of borders I think are unique I then find 
on other button sites. 
</p>
<p>
22) I think animation is my strong point. I try to offer a lot of different types so people can choose. I also
 think it gives the button that final touch, making it just a bit unique and exciting. I love watching the
 buttons loop over and over. There's some sort of life that gets added.
</p>
<p>
23) I feel somewhat satisfied with all of my buttons (but some more than others). They all meet my base
 requirements.
</p>
<p>
24) Other button makers (some of the time), other site owners (rarely), from other neofriends (sometimes),
 from friends/family who don't play Neopets (never), 
other (sometimes I get inspiration from the site I'm requesting for)

<p>
3) Speed (3), Quality (5), Communication (2), Satisfaction (4) , Convenience (1)
</p>
<p>
4) 5
</p>
<p>
5) To me, high-quality service is about delivering high-quality buttons in a suitable amount of time.  
I also think having regular open requests is important since the point of a button request site is to 
make buttons for people, rather than let the site and the "requests are closed" sign sit there.
</p>
<p>
6) For the most part, I don't think visitors distinguish between high and low quality, other than the 
button (the final product).
</p>
<p>
7) About 30-40% of people fail
</p>
<p>
8) Rules (often), Credit (rarely), Theft (never), Unused (sometimes)
</p>
<p>
9) 5
</p>
<p>
10) At least twice a month, though once a week is something I aim for
</p>
<p>
11) 4
</p>
<p>
12) I think communication on the requester's part needs to be improved, especially when site owners  
finish a button but then the requester neomails back and says something like "can you 
use this font?"  I feel that if the requester knows what they want, they should clearly tell the 
button maker ahead of time.
</p>
<p>
13) 5
</p>
<p>
14) Text clarity is a must, image shouldn't be blurry, the border (if there is one) shouldn't cover the text/image 
too much; animation is completely optional, but if it's there, it shouldn't be too harsh and the repeat 
speed shouldn't be too fast
</p>
<p>
15) Sometimes.  I think most requesters know what makes a button high-quality, but on the other hand, 
I've seen buttons that have extremely blurry images, poor text design, and tacky animation called 
high-quality.  It really depends on the person and how much button knowledge they have.
</p>
<p>
16) Text clarity (7), text styling (3), image clarity (6), border (1), animation (2), image editing (5), cropping (4)
</p>
<p>
17) Text clarity (2), text styling (6), image clarity (3), border (5), animation (1), image editing (7), cropping (4)
</p>
<p>
18) Text styling, cropping, image clarity
</p>
<p>
19) Blurry image, hard to read text, animation that repeats too fast
</p>
<p>
20) Text clarity.  A button might not use a focal image (ex. the button might just be a textured backgrond), 
but all buttons will have some sort of text on it.
</p>
<p>
21) Yes
</p>
<p>
22) Most of the time I add animation because the requester wants it.  For buttons that I completely 
design, I tend to add animation to fill in awkward empty spaces on the button base.
</p>
<p>
23) Feel satisfied with a small portion of my buttons.  I get really picky and if I could realistically do so, 
I would take each button request form and make 5 different buttons because I like to experiment.  
</p>
<p>
24)     Other button makers (rarely), 
    Other site owners (non-button sites) (never), 
     From other Neofriends (non-site owners) (never), 
    From friends/family (those who don't play on Neopets) (never), 
    Other (inspiration from the image itself or the textures I intend to use) (most of the time),

5) The site must be user-friendly, great speed/delivery, great communication (be in touch with the
 requester frequently), have a guarantee/policy, have requests open frequently, and things similar 
to this!
</p>
<p>
6) Of course! Requesters definitely know if they are being treated the right way. Most sites today offer 
high-quality requests, but lack in the high-quality service portion.
</p>
<p>
7) I don't do tricks. I assume my requesters will "use" my rules, not "misuse" them.

them in a timely matter. =D
</p>
<p>
12) Button Makers shouldn't be choosy/picky with their requests. Sure there are some requesters that are a bit more rude, but offering high-quality service means offering it to EVERYONE.

20) Image Editing.
</p>
<p>
21) At one point I did. But some of the borders requested didn't go with the requesters button well. 
</p>
<p>
22) To add a bit of unqiueness to the button. Some buttons don't need animation, and that is just fine.
 Animation isn't necessary. 
</p>
<p>
23) I feel completely satisfied with all my buttons. I do have my favorites though. If I don't like how a
 button turns out, I take my time to make another one.

<h2>Anonymous (button maker) </h2>
<div style="padding: 4px; overflow: auto; text-align: left; width: 500px; height: 150px; line-height: 15px;">
1. I've been making buttons for two years.
<p>
2. I own Saranghae, which has been offering button requests since January 2011 (before that date, it was a premade layout site).
</p>
<p>
3. Quality (5), Satisfaction (4), Speed (3), Convenience (2), Communication (1).
</p>
<p>
4. 5.
</p>
<p>
5. High-quality service doesn't only mean making high-quality buttons, but also being professional and on task. The requester shouldn't have to wait too long for their button and the requester should also be satisfied with the result. If the requester feels that button isn't what they were expecting and wants a slight change, then the maker should be able to alter whatever necessary.
</p>
<p>
6. Honestly, no. I find that most visitors judge the service based on the quality of the maker's buttons.
</p>
<p>
7. Of my latest requests, about 10%.
</p>
<p>
8. Rules: sometimes, credit: rarely, theft: never, unused: sometimes
</p>
<p>
9. 5
</p>
<p>
10. At least once a week (based on a waiting list with 5 requesters).
</p>
<p>
11. 3. Although I love owning my sites and it's apparent that I should be professional, my priorities lie on school and family.
</p>
<p>
12. I /never/ neomail the requester if I've accepted their request; I only neomail them when their request is finished. On my part I find it extremely unprofessional, but I personally never liked the idea because I found it a waste of time (even if I just use a copy and paste form!) Because of this, I had to include a NOTE on the requesting page stating this.
</p>
<p>
13. 5.
</p>
<p>
14. My view of a high-quality button is one with a crisp image, visible focal (if any), visible and clear text, a well-chosen font, and good text-placement. With animations, it shouldn't be too fast, strong, and choppy.
</p>
<p>
15. For the most part, yes. There's only so many high-quality button sites, though!
</p>
<p>
16. Text clarity (7), image clarity (6), image editing (5), cropping (4), text-styling (3), animation (2), border (1).
</p>
<p>
17. Image editing (7), cropping (6), text styling (5), cropping (4), border (3), text clarity (2), animation (1).
</p>
<p>
18. Animation.
</p>
<p>
19. Often low-quality buttons will have illegible text, blurry images, and very fast and choppy animations.
</p>
<p>
20. Text clarity. The reason for a button is to advertise a site. No one will know what the site is if the text can't be read!
</p>
<p>
21. I have in the past, but let's just put them all in the past (they really weren't the best).
</p>
<p>
22. Animation adds a type of uniqueness to a button. It helps emphasize the text or fill in some quiet spots.
</p>
<p>
23. I only feel somewhat satisfied with all of my buttons. There are times where I'm so unsatisfied with a button that I've /asked/ the requester if I could remake their button a few days after completion, despite them being satisfied!
</p>
<p>
24. Other button makers: rarely, other site owners: never, from other neofriends: never, from friends/family: never, other (the image itself): most of the time.

<div style="padding: 4px; overflow: auto; text-align: left; width: 500px; height: 150px; line-height: 15px;">
1) If I have a new site that requires buttons, I request. Other then that, I don't really request buttons.
<p>
2) I visit several button sites everyday just to browse through the portfolio, completed requests, waiting list, etc.
</p>
<p>
3) Speed: 1
Quality: 5
Communication: 4
Convenience: 3
</p>
<p>
4) 5 - Buttons have a very special place on a site because they sort of "represent" the site. A pretty button will make viewers more likely to visit rather then a not so pretty one.
</p>
<p>
5) For me, high-quality service means the person making the button keeps in contact with the requester and that the finished product is not blurry, squished, and readable (text).
</p>
<p>
6) I certainly hope that they can. Sometimes when visiting a button site, I do get the feeling that the owner is not able to differentiate between high or low quality. I get this feeling because over time, the buttons still do not improve which is weird.
</p>
<p>
7) I don't mind at all! It is a great way to get people to read your rules. HOWEVER, some people may just look for the word in the rules and carry on without reading the rest. Although it is a great "trick," it is over-used and easy to find. I suggest using other tricks in the rules besides the word one.
</p>
<p>
8) a. Every button site I've visited had fair rules
</p>
<p>
9) From 1 (not important at all) to 5 (extremely important), how much importance do you place on the "rules" at a button request site? Choose from:
4 - somewhat important.
</p>
<p>
10) Once every two weeks is nice, but twice per month is nice as well!
</p>
<p>
11) Never - After sending in my form, I wait for their reply whether it be a rejection or acception neomail. I NEVER pester the maker about when my button(s) will be done.
</p>
<p>
12) Quality is one of the main things people should focus on. Communication, such as rejecting or accepting a request, is also very important. I feel that button makers should always contact requesters to let them know if their request has been rejected or accepted.
</p>
<p>
13) No replies back from my request. A simple rejection or acception neomail would be very nice.
</p>
<p>
14) Text is legible, image is not blurry or distorted, and nicely animated.
</p>
<p>
15) Yes.
</p>
<p>
16) Text clarity: 7, Text styling: 1, Image clarity: 6, Border: 3, Animation: 4, Image editing: 2, Cropping: 5, 
</p>

17) Text clarity: 5, Text styling: 3, Image clarity: 7, Border: 1, Animation: 4, Image editing: 2, Cropping: 6
</p>

18) Yes - a distorted or blurry image.
</p>
<p>
19) Image clarity
</p>
<p>
20) Button quality: 4, Frequent open requests: 3, Word of mouth: 2, Quality of service: 1
</p>
<p>
21) The quality of the button and NOT the time it takes to make.
</p>
<p>
22) Feel satisfied with some of your buttons
</p>
<p>
23) Never.
</p>
<p>
24) I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the finished button.
I requested a button for a new site but it never ended up opening.
</p>
<p>
25) Yes.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
26) I never got a reply back.
</p>
<p>
27) Yes - I was immediately worred about not getting a reply back.

5. I would define a high-quality service as a site that, first and foremost, offers buttons that look good as well as satisfies their customers so they'll be sure to return. I also feel that speed plays a huge role in a high-quality service button request site. If I requested from a site &amp; receive a button weeks or months later, I probably wouldn't put the site as my number one choice.
</p>
<p>
6)  Yes
</p>
<p>
7) I can definitely understand why button request sites have trick in their rules, and I think it's a great idea. Though, sometimes, I find myself reading the rules over and over to make sure I didn't miss any changes to the 'word'.

12) I feel like lots of requesters could be more polite and load up on the "please &amp; thank yous".

13) I haven't run into too many problems, but I have been in a situation where the requester /lost/ my request, or never ended up making the button they agreed to make.

3: Least important comes first: communication, speed, convenience, satisfaction, &amp; quality.
</p>
<p>
4: 4.5
</p>
<p>
5: In my eyes, a high quality button request site would have decent or quality buttons, and have them completed up to at least 2 weeks. It also adds in if the owner is kind! (:
</p>
<p>
6: Yes, they should be able to. Otherwise, they're buttons will never improve if they don't compare, contrast, and distinguish the differences.
</p>
<p>
7: I think it's okay that they do that, though I immediately hit the 'back' arrow if there are too many tricks (at least three) or if it's too complicated.
</p>
<p>
8: b. The majority of the button sites I've visited had fair rules.
</p>
<p>
9: Somewhat important (probably a 3.5).
</p>
<p>
10: I think it'd be nice to have requests open a good amount of time, like once or twice every week. But buttons take a while to make, and button makers do have lives too. I'd say around three to four times a month is good.
</p>
<p>
11: Never.
</p>
<p>
12: I think quality is important, but a lot of button sites these days already have great buttons. I think they should focus on communication more now, because avoiding a requester is just plain rude, and happens quite a bit now.
</p>
<p>
13: It'd probably be no reply to my request.
</p>
<p>
14: Original (over-inspired buttons make me bleh), pretty, the image is cropped nicely, and a good, readable font and matching animation to top it all off.
</p>
<p>
15: Of course. That's one of the reasons on whether you want to continue on or leave the site.
</p>
<p>
16: Text clarity, image clarity, image editing, cropping, animation, text styling, and border. Ranked from most to least important.
</p>
<p>
17: Animation, text styling, cropping, image editing, border, image clarity, and text clarity. Ranked from most to least important.
</p>
<p>
18: Yup. Blurry text and oddly cropped images are two. Animation is another one - it would look weird if a shine animation was really slow, or if a moving text animation was too fast to read. This isn't really common anymore, but some people use borders that take away from the button itself.
</p>
<p>
19: Image clarity.
</p>
<p>
20: Least to most important: Word of mouth, frequent open requests, quality of service, button quality.
</p>
<p>
21: Usually, quality. I don't want to waste buttons, so I request from sites with buttons that I'll actually use. Friendliness is next - I wouldn't want to request from a hostile or rude person!
</p>
<p>
22: Feel somewhat satisfied with all of my buttons.
</p>
<p>
23: Rarely.
</p>
<p>
24: I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the finished button.
</p>
<p>
25: Yep, but rarely. I usually like the end product and wouldn't want to bother the person who made it, even if they were busy or not.
</p>
<p>
26: They remade the button - it was just a minor change, but the button still looked better.
</p>
<p>
27: Yes. I usually don't do it if it's minor - after all, I can just live with it.

<h2>Anonymous (button requester) </h2>
<div style="padding: 4px; overflow: auto; text-align: left; width: 500px; height: 150px; line-height: 15px;">
1. I usually request only when I have to, and since I am able to make my own buttons, I don't feel like there's a pressing need. So really, only occasionally.
<p>
2. I visit a few times a week.
</p>
<p>
3. Speed - 2, Quality - 4, Communication - 1, Satisfaction - 5, Convenience - 3
</p>
<p>
4. 5
</p>
<p>
5. I think high-quality service is making the requester feel like they mean something important to the site and the site owner. I think requesters feel very brushed aside, almost like a nuisance, and good service is making sure the people you are serving are happy with the service you're giving them. It doesn't matter if I'm given the most amazing button in the world; if I'm treated like I don't matter or I'm a bother to a site owner, I won't come back.
</p>
<p>
6. I feel like they definitely can.
</p>
<p>
7. I'm half and half on the trick. I think it makes people read the rules more carefully, but most of the time "carefully" is just scanning the text until you see something along the lines of "If you've read the rules, please put ____ in your form".
</p>
<p>
8. A
</p>
<p>
9. Very important
</p>
<p>
10. I think at least three times a month, depending on how many requests are taken though; if only like three requests are taken at a time, then at least five times a month. If a request site barely opens requests, then I don't really consider it much of a request site if I can barely request anything half the time.
</p>
<p>
11. I usually only contact people I've requested from if I never got a confirmation mail from them.
</p>
<p>
12. I think something that's very basic but not that often done is confirming a request form with the requester. To me, that's a sign that someone has seen my mail, accepted my request, and started working on it; that they are taking an active role in the request. If I don't get a confirmation from them, I'll be sitting there wondering if I ever sent it in, or if my request was accepted, or if they even saw it or not.
</p>
<p>
13. I requested a button from a site over a week ago, and they still haven't replied to me. Their waiting list isn't updated, their site hasn't had any new updates, and so I wonder if they're even active right now. It heavily brings down the credibility of the site and I probably won't be requesting there again.
</p>
<p>
14. High quality buttons mean good image placement, good textplace, good font choice, and distinct and smooth animations.
</p>
<p>
15. I think visitors and requesters can definitely tell.
</p>
<p>
16. 6, 4, 5, 2, 3, 7, 1
</p>
<p>
17. 1, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3
</p>
<p>
18. I don't think so. I think a lot of different factors contribute to a low-quality button. It's different for every person, because everyone has their own expectations of what a good button is.
</p>
<p>
19. Image clarity
</p>
<p>
20. 3, 1, 2, 4
</p>
<p>
21. I first look at the portfolio to see what kind of buttons they make. If they make good buttons with pleasing animations and good image editing, I'll want to request there more. Also, if a site has a beautiful and unique layout, I will remember it and I tend to like sites with pretty layouts. Ultimately, I look to see the way they talk to the requester, the way their word their rules and such. If I see a person who doesn't seem like they will make the requesting experience good, I won't really request there. Also, I occasionally request from newer sites because I think it's good to show them some support.
</p>
<p>
22. I always feel completely satisfied with my buttons, because everyone I've requested from has always been willing to make little changes to my request. So in the end, I'm always happy with what I've requested because the site owners are more than willing to make changes if I'm not completely happy with it.
</p>
<p>
23. Never
</p>
<p>
24. n/a
</p>
<p>
25. Yes, but they were minor changes, such as a font choice, or a darker animation color. I have never requested a complete re-do of a button.
</p>
<p>
26. No, the button makers I've asked for changes from have been extremely helpful and gracious. They have been more than willing to make changes if I don't like something in my button. I think that's a huge mark of good service.
</p>
<p>
27. No

<h1>Editing resources</h1>

<br><br><h2>Button borders</h2>
Though you should be creating your own button borders by hand, brand new button makers may want to use 
premade ones for the time being.  Here are some sites that offer borders that you can use (I would recommend 
that you put some form of credit at your site):
<p>
- <a href="/~Dumblydohr#5">Impulse's Tutorial</a>
<br>
The borders will require you to do some "tracing" since they are grey in colour and not transparent.  
Some examples of borders from the site include:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/34hxsli.gif" style="padding: 5px;"><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/2a7hf95.gif" style="padding: 5px;"><img src="http://i50.tinypic.com/mhsqvs.gif" style="padding: 5px;"></center>

<p>
- <a href="/~quinsai#buttonresources">Bedazzled</a>
<br>
A lot of interesting border designs can be found here.  Note that the site is extremely image heavy and may take several minutes to load.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/25gw4qo_th.png" style="padding: 5px;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0S6ZJ.png" style="padding: 5px;"><img src="http://i40.tinypic.com/35l7n0i_th.png" style="padding: 5px;"></center>



<p>
- <a href="/~singlerain">Create Impressions</a>
<br>
There aren't a lot of super unique borders here, but if you're looking for simplistic ones, this is a good site to visit.  
Some examples of borders from the site include:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>

<h2>Textures and other image editing resources


</h2>
<p>
- <a href="/~liahness">Details</a>
<br>
The bokeh textures are absolutely gorgeous and well made.  I find that the abstract textures have less use since 
they are very heavy and will sometimes make the button base look more blurry and lower quality.

</p>
<p>
- <a href="/~seawihnd#BBA">Illusion</a>
<br>
For the most part, the bokeh textures here are extremely colourful, which may be a positive or negative 
depending on what you're hoping to achieve with your button base.  There are a few grey/colourless textures 
if you're looking for <i>only</i> the bokeh effect.


</p>
<p>
- <a href="/~tadpll">Whirligig</a>
<br>
There are a lot of large bokeh textures, but there's also <i>button textures</i> which have been re-sized 
so that they're 88 by 31 pixels.  This is great for those who don't want to re-size the textures themselves.


</p>
<p>
- <a href="/~Toit#three">Jubilee Resources</a>
<br>
A lot of different types of textures can be found here, ranging from dust/scratches to light/bokeh.

</p>
<p>
- <a href="/~quinsai#buttonresources">Bedazzled</a>
<br>
Like Whirligig, there are 88 by 31 pixel button textures here.  Most of them are colour-heavy and may change your 
button base image.  Note that the site is extremely image heavy and may take several minutes to load.




</p>
<p>
Need more textures?  I would highly recommend going to a large directory (like <a href="/~Directory">The Shelf</a>) and 
looking through the "graphics" section.  Sometimes, these sites will have "extras".






</p>
<h2>Button Bases</h2>
If you're completely new to button making, try your hand at adding and editing text before you go off 
and start your own request site.  The text should be one of the first things you master since a button's 
most important aspect <i>is</i> the text.  The list below are sites that offer button bases.

<p>
- <a href="/~XxNight_ProwlerxX110#bb">Dark Light</a>
<br>
A large handful of button bases here (over 20 Neo related ones). There are some bases that use 
generic backgrounds so if you're experimenting with a non-focal image button, check this site out.
Examples of button bases: 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i53.tinypic.com/25i7vo0.jpg" style="padding: 5px;"><img src="http://i54.tinypic.com/2u77yh2.jpg" style="padding: 5px;"></center>


<p>
- <a href="/~seawihnd#BBA">Illusion</a>
<br>
Not a lot of button bases here, but they are very high-quality.  The images are super crisp! 
Examples of button bases:

<p>
- <a href="/~Interstade#resources">Open Eyes</a>
<br>
A large handful of Neo-related button bases.  Examples of button bases: 
</p>
<p>

<p>
- <a href="/~quinsai#blank">Bedazzled</a>
<br>
There's a ton of high-quality Neo-related button bases.  One thing to note is that the site is extremely image heavy and may require a long time to fully load since the buttons 
are located at the same petpage as everything else.  Examples of button bases: 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/yPsMy.png" style="padding: 5px;"><img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/2mmbgol.png" style="padding: 5px;"></center>

<p>
- <a href="/~grundogeisha#resbut">The Workshop</a>
<br>
There's a handful of Neo-related buttons here, most of which have the border included.  Some of the 
images are quite blurry, so these would probably work best for experimenting with text and animation.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i50.tinypic.com/35jl5xy.png" style="padding: 5px;"><img src="http://i46.tinypic.com/2j47bew.png" style="padding: 5px;"></center>




<p>
- <a href="/~singlerain">Create Impressions</a>
<br>
There aren't a lot here (only 9 or so) so this is a good resource if you're just interested in experimenting 
with text placement, editing, and animation.  Examples of button bases: 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i26.tinypic.com/2wmnw2f.png" style="padding: 5px;"><img src="http://i32.tinypic.com/midnkg.png" style="padding: 5px;"></center>


<p>
Need more button bases? I would highly recommend going to a large directory (like <a href="/~Directory">The Shelf</a>) and 
looking through the "graphics" section.  Additionally, try looking at button request sites.  They sometimes 
offer bases as an "extra".

<p>

</p>
<h2>Neo-related images</h2>
<p>
- <a href="/~Voget">Charly's SWF Collection</a>
<br>
This is an amazing resource if you're looking for simple backgrounds.  It's frequently updated with new backgrounds so you'll always be able to find the latest images.
</p>
<p>
- <a href="//www.neopets.com/~hawiku">Background Bonanza</a>
<br>
Again, you can find many Neopet backgrounds here.  I've switched to using <b>Charly's SWF Collection</b> though, because Background Bonanza is hardly updated.
</p>
<p>
- <a href="//www.neopets.com/backgrounds.phtml">Neopets backgrounds</a>
<br>
This page is a great resource for button makers.  There's a <i>ton</i> to look through.  Most of the time, you can make your button bases directly from the "preview" image.  If you want to enlarge it to crop for a smaller part of the image, then it's best if you download the background and crop the much larger wallpaper.
</p>
<p>
- <a href="//www.neopets.com/~littlejublieee">Zel's Page of Shopkeepers</a>
<br>
Though this page doesn't have as many images as the previous examples, it's still a very good resource to keep handy.  Shopkeeper images are some of the newer ones on Neopets.
</p>
<p>
- <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/caption/caption_archive.phtml">Caption Contest archives</a>
<br>
With over 1000 images, this is another good resource but only if you're willing to put in the time and browse through them all.  I'd highly recommend skipping the ones where it's "real" images (i.e. the ones of plushies or other merchandise").
</p>
<p>
- <i>Dr. Sloth's Neopets Image Emporium!</i>
<br>
(<i>offsite</i>) This is my #1 resource for images.  There are just so many to go through!  I'd highly recommend searching by category if you're just looking for general images.

<h1>Applying a gradient overlay to text</h1>

Adding a gradient layer to your text can make it look much more stylish!  However, it requires that you pay attention to text visibility, making sure that it's not <i>too</i> dark.  Because of this, I would recommend this technique for <i>more experienced</i> button makers.
<p>
<b>Step 1:</b> The button I'll be working with is this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/grad1.png"></center>
<p>
So far, the text has been styled with a single-coloured border as well as a blurry layer underneath.  We could leave it like this, but the white text seems to be a little awkward.  Sometimes, standing out <i>too</i> much can make a button look odd.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 2:</b>
First, click on your foreground colour.  This should automatically transform your cursor into an eyedropper tool.  Then, click on your button base to "grab" a colour.  In the screenshot below, I've pointed out which areas you will be clicking.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/grad2.png" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
Make sure that at least <i>one</i> of your colours is white (i.e. the squares).  It doesn't matter whether the foreground or background colour is white, but at least one of them must be.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 3:</b> Because my text border colour is blue, I've clicked on a blue area of the button base.  If you notice in the screenshot in the previous step, the colour is quite dark.  If we simply went ahead and applied the gradient technique, here's what we would get:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/grad3.png"></center>
<p>
This is <i>bad</i>!  The text is almost unreadable and the colours just look way too awkward.  Instead, we're going to edit our colour choice.
</p>
<p>
Click on the square that contains your colour choice (i.e. not the white one, but the colour that you grabbed in the previous step).  When you click the square, the Color Picker window should pop up.  We want to make it much lighter so that we get the gradient effect but the text remains easy to read.  Take a look at this screenshot:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/grad4.png" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
The small red arrow indicates what you should click first.  That brings up the Color Picker -blocked-  The large arrow shows the "new" color I've chosen.  We're still in the same colour range (i.e. dark blue), but I've chosen a much lighter colour.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 4:</b> Now it's time to apply the gradient layer.  Looking at your Layers window, make sure your <i>text</i> layer is the one that is selected.  At the bottom of the window, click on "Add a layer style" (the symbol is a circle with a fancy "F").  A menu should pop up.  Choose "Gradient Overlay".
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/grad5.png" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<b>Step 5:</b> The "Gradient Overlay" window should pop up.  Take a look at the screenshot below.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/grad6.png" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
Click on the tab indicated in the red box.  This makes some options drop down.  What we want is the "foreground to transparent" option.  This is indicated by the red arrow.  Yours may not be in the same position so make sure that it looks somewhat similar to the option pointed out in the screenshot.  Once you find that gradient style, click it.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 6:</b> And this is what we're left with:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/grad7.png"></center>
<p>
If you find that your gradient overlay is took dark, you can always go back and choose a lighter colour
</p>
<p>
In many cases, I find that the text looks best when the white colour is near the top and the other colour is near the bottom (in this case, the blur is near the bottom).  
<br></p>
<h2>Final tips:</h2>
- Gradient overlays look very nice with the font used in the tutorial above.  It's called "Awesome", and it's a very large for a small font!  The gradient effect is much more noticeable than smaller fonts, like Wendy.
<p>
- Don't want to use white?  You can choose <i>two</i> colours instead.  However, this is not recommended for beginners as you can easily make a mistake with your colour choices, leading to a disastrous text style.

<h1>Sharpen your button base</h1>


Blurry button base?  Sharpening your button base is a way to improve image clarity which helps in maintaining a high-quality button.  

<p>
<b>Step 1:</b> Take a look at the button below:

</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/sharp1.png"></center>
<p>
It hasn't been edited in anyway.  However, after colouring techniques and applying various textures, you may notice your base getting "fuzzy" or blurry like this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/sharp2.png"></center>
<p>
Okay, so the button base here isn't really that blurry and I've seen far worse.  Photoshop's cropping tool is an <i>excellent</i> way to try to get the best possible button base.  This is because cropping in Photoshop retains your image's ratio.  You can read more about this in the "final tip" section at the bottom).
</p>
<p>
What we want to do <i>first</i> is duplicate your button base.  To do this, go to the top of your screen, click "Layer", choose "Duplicate Layer", then click "Okay".  What you should end up with is this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/sharp3.png"></center>
<p>
<b>Step 2:</b> Make sure your top layer is selected (if you take a look at the screenshot above, notice how the duplicated layer (Layer 8 copy) is highlighted in blue.
</p>
<p>
Go to the top, click "Filter", choose "Sharpen", then click "Sharpen".  
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/sharp4.png" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<b>Step 3:</b> You should see an instant difference with your <i>top</i> layer.  Here's what my button looks like now:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/sharp5.png"></center>
<p>
Notice how much more details have been "re-added" to the image.  The facial area of the focal image is much more crisp.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 4:</b> What happens if you sharpen <i>too</i> much?  In some cases, sharpening your top layer will result in lines that are jagged and "pixellated".  If this is the case, let's <i>blend</i> your top layer and with the bottom layer.  Go to your Layers window and make sure the top layer (the sharpened layer) is selected.  Then, change the <i>opacity</i> so that your image is still crisp but the jagged/pixilation isn't as noticeable.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/sharp6.png" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<b>And you're done!</b>  This is a very simple way to get the best out of your images and retain some of the details lost during texturing and colouring.  One last thing I like to do is <i>merge</i> the sharpened and "normal" layer together.  You can quickly do this by doing to the top of your screen, choose "Layer", and choose "Merge visible" (which should be near the bottom of the list).
<br></p>
<h2>Final tips:</h2>
- If you're using the "crop" tool in Photoshop with the correct button dimension input (88px for width and 33px for height), then chances are you may not need to sharpen all of your bases (only the ones that are super blurry).  This is because the crop function in Photoshop retains the ratio of the number you input.

<h1>Quick Photoshop 7 Tutorial</h1>

Here is a general overview of what my Photoshop work area looks like.  
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/tutorial_2.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<b>Layers screen</b>
The Layers screen is extremely important, so your workstation should include this.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/tutorial_3.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
The higher up a layer is in the list, the more it'll show.  
For example, Layer 2 is a bokeh layer set to <i>screen</i>.  If I were to move Layer 1, which 
contains my button image, above Layer 2, then the bokeh layer would not be visible.  
Where you organize your layers in the list is very important as well.  
</p>
<p>
Generally,  I put the button base image at the very bottom.  Any textures would go above that.  Near the very top, I have my text layers, and at the very top are the button borders.  Never put your text layers below your texture layers because then that will have an impact on text visibility.
</p>
<p>
Next is the menu at the top.  I make reference to this a lot so here's what it looks like:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/tutorial_4.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
Depending on what tool you currently have, the area in the red box will change accordingly.  For instance, if I chose a Brush tool instead, then I'll see brush options like size and opacity.
</p>
<p>
One of the most important screens you should have is the Tools. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/tutorial_5.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
In the screenshot above, I've highlighted some that I'll be using in various tutorials.
<br></p>
<h2>Why don't I have a certain screen up?</h2>
Depending on your Photoshop options, some of your screens might not be available.  To get them to "show up", go to the top bar and click "screen".  Then choose the screen you want to appear.
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/tutorial_6.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
If something has a checkmark beside it, then it's currently visible in your workspace.  If it doesn't have a checkmark, just click on it and it should appear.

<h1>Editing your borders</h1>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Gradient on the outer border:</h3>
<p>
<i>Step 1:</i> 
First, choose dominant colours from your base image. You can do this by clicking on the individual squares indicated and then using the eyedropper tool, click on your image.  This will "capture" your colour.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_16.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 2:</i> 
In your layer screen, make sure the layer with the <b>outer</b> border is selected (i.e. the black one).  At the bottom of your screen, click on the icon that has a circle with an "f" in the middle (an example can be seen below).  Choose "Gradient Overlay".
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_17.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 3:</i> 
A screen should pop up.  The default gradient colour is black and white, but we want to use the colours we grabbed earlier.  Click the "gradient" tab and choose the first option, "foreground to background".
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_18.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 4:</i> 
If you take a look at our button, you may notice that the darker tones are generally on the left side of the image while the brighter colours are on the right side.  Let's make our outer border reflect this!
</p>
<p>
In the same screen, adjust the <b>angle</b> degree so that our gradient is more horizontal (earlier it was dark brown at the bottom, orange at the top; we want dark brown on the left, orange on the right).  
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_19.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<span class="u">ABC Extra:</span>  After adjusting your colours, you might find that you're ending up with the complete opposite (for instance, orange on the left, dark brown on the right).  In this case, click the "Reverse" option which should switch your colours around.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 5:</i> 
After applying our gradient overlay, here's what we're left with:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_20.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Examples of other buttons that uses a gradient border:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/gingersnap.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/starspring.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
<b>Final tips:</b>
<br>
- When grabbing your two colours from your button base, you might want to edit them a bit 
further by making them slightly darker.  For example, let's say I have a button like this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/absolutely.gif"></center>
<p>
Choosing the colour for the left side of the border, I used the eyedropper tool and got this: <font color="FBDEC6">#FBDEC6</font> (#FBDEC6).  This is <b>very</b> light and wouldn't be a great choice for a button border.  <font color="F0BC97">#F0BC97</font> (#F0BC97) is a similar shade yet it's darker and more suitable.  Because it's essentially in the same colour range, it won't make your button look strange (in other words, you'll still retain your colour palette).




<br></p>
<h3>Darker "see through" border</h3>
<i>Step 1:</i> 
Make sure the layer with your black outer border is selected.  Near the top, set the layer to "soft light".
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_21.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Here's what we're left with:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_22.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Note the bottom right side of the button.  The yellow looks unappealing and the border seems to fade.  This border style isn't a very good choice with our button.  With border design, not every style will fit with your button base.  For intermediate button makers, there are ways around this (for instance, editing the colours in that particular area to make it darker).  If you're a beginner, it's best to just try a different border style.
</p>
<p>
Here are some examples of buttons that use the overlay method:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/ethereal_2.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/promise_6.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
<span class="u">ABC Extra:</span> Depending on the colours of your button base, setting your border to overlay or soft light may not do much.  Take the above example for instance.  Generally, I like to use overlay/soft light on somewhat lighter images.  If your image is too dark, then your overlay/soft light border won't show up.  But be careful!  Images that are <b>too</b> light will result in a border that doesn't look that great.  Experiment!
<br></p>
<h3>Editing the inner white border</h3>
Though you can leave the inner white border as it is, generally you'll want to play around with it a bit more to see the type of effects you can achieve.  Here are a few that I like to use.
<p>
<b>Neon overlay</b>
</p>
<p>
Choosing the layer that has the white inner border, I set that to "overlay".  Here's what I get
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_23.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Keep in mind that this technique may not work with every button base you have.  Here, it works generally well, especially in the bottom right corner.  You can definitely see the "neon" effect of the white inner border.  However, take a look at the top right area.  The white line is barely noticeable. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="u">ABC Extra:</span>  You might see this as the exact opposite problem with the black border set to soft light.  
</p>
<p>
With this type of border style, it's best if you can achieve an overlay effect with the entire white border, rather than just a corner.
</p>
<p>
Here are some examples of white inner borders set to overlay:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/parchment.gif" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/promise_8.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
<b>Soft light</b>
</p>
<p>
Setting the inner white border to "soft light" rather than "overlay" gives it a much more subtle appearance.  In this example, using soft light isn't a very good choice.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_24.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
The white inner border isn't that noticeable.  I tend to use the "soft light" technique with much darker images because the border will still be faded, but noticeable.
</p>
<p>
Here are some examples of white inner borders set to soft light:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/atalila.png" style="padding: 3px;"><img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/88BY31/calibre_2.gif" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Editing the opacity yourself</b>
</p>
<p>
Lowering the opacity of the white border to around 85% gives me this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_25-1.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
While the white inner border is still noticeable, it's blended into the button a bit better.  It's not so white that it's the first thing you notice.  
</p>
<h2>Final tips</h2>
- With lighter images, editing the white inner border may not be a good idea.  If you lowered the opacity of the white inner border, then it'll hardly be noticeable.
<p>
- For brand new button makers, I suggest perfecting single-coloured borders before moving on to these techniques.  Choose a single colour for the border is harder than it seems, especially if you're still new to creating buttons.  <b>Use</b> your colour palette - don't make your button border purple when your button base is comprised of blues and greens.  
</p>
<p>
- Like a frame for a painting, your button border <i>frames</i> your base image.  Your border is <b>not</b> the centerpiece of your button.

<h1> Creating your own button borders</h1>

<i>Step 1:</i> Open up a new screen by holding "Ctrl" and pressing "N", or go to the top of the screen, choose "File" and click "New".  This screen should pop up:
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_4.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
Make sure the height and width are 88 and 31, respectively.  In the "contents" option, choose <b>transparent</b>.  This last step is extremely important.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 2:</i> 
Since the screen is a bit small, let's enlarge it so we can work a bit more easily.  While holding "Ctrl", press the "plus" button until you're more comfortable with the size.  Note that we'll be drawing using a 1 pixel pencil brush so anyway around 900% zoom and up is useful.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 3:</i> 
In the "tools" screen, click on the "pencil" icon (alternatively, you can press "B" on your keyboard).  If you see a "brush" icon instead, right click it and choose the pencil.  Make sure your <b>foreground</b> colour is black since we'll be drawing the outside of our button base first.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_5.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
For the border, our pencil size needs to be <i>1</i>.  Here's a screenshot of the top of the window (make sure your settings are the same): 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/draw.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 4:</i> Now, just draw your <b>outer</b> button border.  For this tutorial, I'll be creating the "plus" button border.  After you're done creating the outer border, create a new layer above your outer border layer.  You can do this by clicking the icon highlighted in the red square below or go to the top of your screen, click "Layer", "New", "Layer", then "OK".  Choose your new layer by clicking on it.  It should be highlighted in blue.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_6.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 5:</i> 
Now we're going to draw the white inner border.  To quickly switch colours, just click on the double-headed arrow indicated in the screenshot below.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_7.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Make sure that your <b>second</b> layer is chosen (i.e.  the empty one that doesn't have anything in it).  Using the black outer border as our guideline, draw your inner border.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_8.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 6:</i> 
Save your border as a <b>PSD</b> file while keeping the <b>layers</b>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/border_9.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
Now whenever you want to use that border, you don't have to draw it from scratch.  You'll have a saved copy!

<h1> Creating scan lines from scratch</h1>
<i>Step 1:</i> In Photoshop 7, open a new screen.  You can do this by holding "Ctrl" and pressing "N" or go to the top of the screen, click "File", and choose "New".  A screen should pop up.  For this tutorial, I'll be creating a scan line pattern that's 5 by 5 pixels.
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/scan_1.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
Make sure that your new screen is <b>transparent</b>!  This is a very important step.  In the screenshot above, it has a red arrow beside it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 2:</i> The new screen is tiny!  Let's zoom in so we can easily work with it.  You can do this by looking at the very bottom left corner of your screen.  I've input 1600%
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/scan_2.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Alternatively, you can just hold "Ctrl" and press the plus sign (near the Backspace or the Delete key) until your screen is large enough to work with.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 3:</i> In the Tools screen, click on the "pencil" tool highlighted in the red square below (if you see a brush icon instead, just right-click on it, and choose the pencil icon).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/scan_3.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="100" height="50"></center>
<p>
For this tutorial, I'm going to be making black scan lines so that's what I've chosen as my foreground colour.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 4:</i> Time to draw our scan line!  Using the "pencil", draw the blocks so it looks something like this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/scan_4.png" style="padding: 3px;"></center>
<p>
Don't limit yourself to only diagonal scan lines.  Take a look at some others I've created:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/scan_5-1.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
It's strange to think of creating scan lines as creative, but it definitely can be!
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 5:</i> We've drawn our scan line so let's turn it into a <b>pattern</b> so that we can quickly and easily use it whenever we want.  At the top of your screen, click "Edit" and choose "Define pattern".
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/scan_6.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 6:</i> A screen like this should pop up:

<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/scan_7.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
Enter the name of whatever you want to call your scan line pattern.  I'm lazy so I never name my patterns.
</p>
<p>
<i>Step 7:</i>  Now that our scan line is a pattern, let me show you how to use it.  The first step is to choose the "Paint Bucket" tool.  You can do this easily by pressing "G" on your keyboard.  If you see a "gradient" icon instead, right-click it and choose the paint bucket.
</p>
<p>
Next, look near the top of your screen.  You should see something that says "Fill".  Change that to "pattern".
</p>
<p>
Beside that, the "pattern" option should pop up.  Click on the tab and select the scan lines.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<center>
<img src="http://i498.photobucket.com/albums/rr350/superbubblet/ABC/scan_8.png" style="padding: 3px;" width="300" height="50"></center>
<p>
<i>Step 8:</i> You're ready to go!  Using the paint bucket, you can fill a layer with that scan line pattern.

<h2>Final tips</h2>
- The size of your original screen will dictate how spread out the scan lines are.  In this case, I used a 5 by 5 pixel screen.  The scan lines are rather spread out.  Much smaller ones include 3 by 3, for a really "compact" scan line pattern.  I would suggest around 4 because smaller sizes can look low-quality very easily.
<p>
- When adding scan lines to your image, <b>always</b> make sure that you're filling an <b>empty</b> layer above the image, not the image itself.
</p>
<p>
- Experiment with colours!  I made mine black because it showed up more clearly.
