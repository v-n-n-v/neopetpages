<h1>Lucy's Button Tutorial</h1>

Welcome to Lucy's Button Tutorial. This tutorial was made by <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=lucyisdabomb">Lucyisdabomb</a> (aka Lucy) to help you make <i>high quality</i> buttons using a free (and amazing!) bug-free program, GIMP. This site was certified on September 22, 2010 and currently provides the only <i>in-depth</i> completely GIMP focused button tutorial in Neopia. Forget about MS Paint - it's unecessary! Just google GIMP and download the free program from the official website. How much easier could it get?! This layout is v.1 Calm Rainbow. I hope you find this tutorial helpful, but make sure you send me a <a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=lucyisdabomb&amp;subject=Lucys+Button+Tutorial&amp;message_body=Hello+Lucy...">neomail</a> if you have any questions, comments or suggestions.

<h1>Step by Step Tutorial.</h1>
I thought that because I am really good at making buttons, I should make a <b>button tutorial</b>. Do you want to make a snazzy link back button like following? In this tutorial you can learn how to add important skills to your image, and produce the highest quality, animated product. I proudly present an IN DEPTH tutorial to making amazing buttons using the free program, GIMP. It's easy to install, and it's completely bug-free. I am Lucy, owner of Lucy's Button Tutorial, since 22nd September 2010.<br><i>Please</i> credit me! You don't have to, but it'd be REALLY nice :3

<h1>HELP AND ANSWERS!!</h1>
This is not a 'FAQ' section. This is my Help and Answers section. I put up shortened answers that I have given to actual people! This means that I edit them down, making it an answer that could apply to a broader number of questions :D If you ask a question and I feel that it is very important and would help others, I will place it here. If you would like me to take your  question down for privacy reasons, that's fine. I totally respect that (: Feel free to ask a question...
<p>
<b>1. I'M NOT RECOMMENDED AT THE MAIN DIRECTORIES. WHAT CAN I DO TO FIX THIS?</b><br>
If you feel that your buttons aren't being appreciated, or that your buttons are not as skillfully made as they could be, I strongly suggest you ask a few of your affiliates for some tips.<br>
Catie @ <a href="/~VeraciousSmile">Dreams are Reality</a> (who is a very close friend of mine) taught me everything on my tutorial! I knew NOTHING about buttons before I asked her, and now look at me! I <i>own</i> a button tutorial (: That just goes to show that when you need help, there is a way to find it!!<br>
Most other high quality button site owners also give great advice. You could ask them to help you out too, if you feel comfortable! I'm sure they're very kind as well ^_^<br>
Maybe it's just that little spark that is missing! It may be the reason that you're losing you the prized 'recommended' bullet :o<br>
Everyone starts with the same knoweledge of buttons as each other. The most important thing is that you don't get too down on yourself (: <br>
Improving your buttons will take persistence and practise! Also, if you get tips from other button makers, don't just copy the ideas! Take their advice and make it original.<br>
All of you buzzing button makers have potential. It's a hard task, but I feel that it's worth it! Do you? If you don't, get out of the button business and find something that suits you (: If you do, get to work and score that 'recommended' bullet NOW!<br>
I hope I helped you out. Love, Lucy.
