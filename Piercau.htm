<h1>PERMANENT ACCESS TO THE MAGMA POOL</h1>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tjEzPQo.jpg" width="500"><br><br><b>The mystery must be solved by 11:59:59 on 31/12/20</b></center>
<h2>Things We Know:</h2>					
<ul class="list"><li>- Some users can take their pets to the Magma Pool at any time rather than having to wait for a specific 10-minute window each day.
</li>
<li>- When JumpStart bought Neopets, the server change meant that people's magma pool times changed. Nothing else about the process is known to have been affected by this.</li>
<li>- tnt Van Doodle has commented that <i>you have until December 31st, then not for a while</i>, and also that <i>If you're not locked out from a recent dip, don't worry about waits. Best of luck!</i></li>
</ul><h2>The Poem</h2>
On 18 Dec 2020 at 4:23 pm, tnt_vandoodle posted a cryptic message on our original Magma Pool thread. There were more cryptic clues hidden throughout his Neopets account - ciphers which needed to be solved in order to reveal a poem!
<p>
<i>before you set upon this path<br>
know it may already be in vain<br>
for some expeditions, now long past<br>
can not be done again</i></p><p>
<i>guard your heart, my dearest love.<br>
and heed the words i've spoken.<br>
but know that it can still be mended<br>
if you find it broken</i></p><p>
<i>a love that strong, my dear companion<br>
build it piece by piece<br>
for only through true dedication<br>
will it never cease</i></p><p>
<i>on your journey you may find<br>
the sunset fade to night<br>
but know that you are never lost<br>
for i'm your guiding light</i></p><p>
<i>times may come when harm will bounce<br>
towards you from all sides<br>
wait 30 score and half five more<br>
until the risk subsides</i></p><p>
<i>and when you feel that hope is lost<br>
and your future is uncertain<br>
seek counsel from the warm and wise<br>
to pull away the curtain</i></p><p>
<i>with this i leave one final tip<br>
for which you may now ponder<br>
remember that some time apart<br>
can make the heart grow fonder</i></p><p>

<b>Greetings, TNT! *hands out candy canes* I love the new magma Neopets! Why did some people not have to wait for the guard to fall asleep to get access to the Magma Pool? ~v*****</b><br><i>We guess the guard was impressed by them!</i><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=423">//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=423</a><p>
<b>Hey, TNT! I have a question I've been wanting to ask: are we allowed to go to the Magma Pool and get a magma Neopet on our side account? I know it's random at the Lab Ray, but what about going to the pool? Thanks, and here are some cookies! (please leave out my username) ~ username removed</b><br><i>You may not earn the right to visit the Magma Pool on your side accounts, as this would also earn you Neopoints, but you are welcome to visit in hopes of sneaking past the sleeping guard, as there are no Neopoints rewarded for doing so.</i><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=433">//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=433</a></p><p>
<b>Hi, TNT. I was wondering if we are allowed to use the Magma Pool on side accounts. It seems okay since the pool doesn't give out any items or Neopoints, but I thought I'd better check with you guys to be sure. :) ~g*****</b><br><i>Yes, you are more than welcome to visit the Magma Pool on your side accounts. :)</i><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=423">//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=423</a></p><p>
<b>Hello, TNT! I absolutely love the little worms that we can collect in Moltara now and I wanted to ask if we can collect them on side accounts? I asked on the boards and was given conflicting answers: some people said it would be allowed since the worms are "no-trade" items, while others replied that it would not be allowed since they can be used to get a tradeable item. I'm not interested in turning them in for the wearable lantern... I just want to put them in my side account's Gallery! Could you please clear this up for everyone (and please remove my username)? Thanks! ~username removed</b><br><i>
Sorry, but we have to ask you to please not collect the worms on your side accounts, as you can receive something that is tradeable from the quest.</i><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=423">//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=423</a></p><p>
<b>How many staff members are "well-versed in the ways of Moltara" and capable of entering the Magma Pool? What does it take to become "True Masters of the Ways of Moltara," and why is it so difficult to do? Seeing as how some Neopians got that right almost immediately, it seems like it may just be random, but I'm sure it's really something quite simple. Could you provide just a hint? *pretty, pretty please begging cookies* ~c*****</b><br><i>Staff members? Not many. The secret to unlimited access to the Magma Pool is well guarded, even here. Honestly we were hoping you guys would figure it out for us so we could know, too. *hangs head in shame*</i><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=436">//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=436</a></p><p>
<b>When individuals ask how to gain access to the Magma Pool in Moltara, others state that the "special" way has not yet been figured out. Is there any way to gain access other than by finding out the time frame of when the guard falls asleep for an individual? ~m*****</b><br><i>Yes, but as far as we can tell, no one has discovered that method just yet.</i><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=489">//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=489</a></p><p>
<b>Hey there CQ! I am very sorry to bother you at this time, but I wanted to bring up something that was kinda forgotten - the Magma Pool! I really wish to paint my pet Magma, but the Tonu guard always seem to be awake and claiming I am not wise enough. Could you please please please give a hint on what it takes to gain access to it? :c ~ s*****</b><br><i>I have no helpful hints on how to become wise enough to be allowed to enter the magma pool, you'll have to figure that out on your own. However, persistence is key - keep visiting at different times to find your time when the Tonu Guard is dozing off if you're determined to have a magma pet!

<h2>Info from People with 24/7 Access</h2>
<b>Cinders</b><br><br><ul class="list"><li>
- I have a bronze trophy and completed the plot, so gold is not a requirement.</li>
<li>- I have looked at plot books and have not read all moltara books to my pet nor did I equip wearables. The backgrounds went into my sdb as did most items.</li>
<li>- I have done all the plot parts. including the games.</li>
<li>- I have collected worms but I have never turned in the ore and gears and made a petpet. I have them all in my sdb. (lantern and worms)</li>
<li>- my account now is impressive, but back then it was not nearly as impressive as others.</li>
<li>- I may have not had it but on making a pet and disowning it.. I may have returned to have access.</li>
<li>- There are 4 games in the comic still open and a few items you can still collect. Those have also been tested including doing them all on the same day.</li>
<li>- [on noticing when they had access] for me it was about 1 month after the plot ended I believe..</li>
<li>- [on gallery size] doubt it it was 11 years ago and BTY is what forced my gallery expansion</li>
<li>- game count was one of my goals so i played a lot of games, sponsor and such to just add to the total games played.</li>
<li>- I ignored having it once I turned a pet and disowned it and it changed from magma.. before transfer made it work :)</li>
<li>- Silver AoTA trophy</li>
<li>- 15/16 quest items collected</li></ul><p>
<b>Angelfire</b>
</p><ul class="list"><li>- The only thing that I can think of is that I have all 10 worms and the lanterns in my gallery. No idea if that has anything to do with it though, or if it would matter these days.</li>
<li>- Just gave [pet] a dip, it's still working.</li>
<li>- Don't remember exactly when I noticed it, 4+ years at least.</li>
<li>- I've turned at least 5 different species to Magma, most recently my Kyrii</li>
<li>- Gold Magma AoTA trophy</li>
</ul><p>
<b>Leap</b><br></p><ul class="list"><li>- I also have permanent access to the magma pool. I don't remember doing anything special to get it, that plot was a long time ago.</li>
<li>- I did dip a pet, but after I had permanent access. I always thought it had something to do with worms, but knowing tnt it's probably totally random. :D</li>
<li>- I did make a Gio and attach to a pet within moments of Gios being a thing, I guess. That's my clearest memory of AoTA. That, and arguing with tnt about prizes.</li>
<li>- No, my account was meh and my gallery probably didn't even exist. AoTA was one of my earliest site event trophies. I had played a bunch of games by that point, that was the main thing I did on the site.</li>
<li>- I participated in the plot, was active when Moltara was first released. Also played a lot of games daily to earn nps at the time. If there was a sponsor game available to play, I played it.</li>
<li>- Gold AoTA trophy</li>
<p>
<b>Tr3b</b><br></p><ul class="list"><li>- The only thing I can remember from back then was going into the Moltaran Caves with the lantern and finding the Red Moltite first time. Other than that I have no idea.</li>
<li>- I had to collect all the worms for the lantern. Dipped plenty of pets in the years since.</li>
<li>- <i>So am I understanding correctly that you had the permanent access pretty much immediately after the plot ended?</i> Correct.</li>
<li>- that's all I remember from back then.</li>
<li>- Gold AoTA trophy</li>
</ul><p>
<b>Enchanted</b><br></p><ul class="list"><li>- I had permanent access on this account, but I lost it. I sent a ticket about it years later, and they wouldn't give it back (they don't keep records that long, so they couldn't if they wanted to). They did say I could gain access again, but I don't know how. I never found my time window on this account.</li>
<li>- I did the plot</li>
<li>- I did the worms (maybe after gaining access, I don't remember)</li>
<li>- I never dipped a pet before getting access, I was looking for my time window and one day found the guard just greeting me</li>
<li>- I play games every day, and do dailies, not much else, so the only thing I can think of is that is was a game or daily maybe + some things I already did like the plot. I also don't know why I and many other people lost the access.</li>
<li>- I remember I painted my Draik Magma when I created her November 14 2011. So I had access then.</li>
<li>- I think game high scores are not part of the requirements, because TNT told me they lost the record of me getting access and high scores are kept.</li>
<li>- Silver AoTA trophy</li>
</ul><p>
<b>Roxie</b><br></p><ul class="list"><li>- I have the perm pool from the start of the world. I just did a few steps and when to the pool and it said the Falling :
<i>Welcome to Moltara's Magma Pool! You must be a true master in the ways of Moltara. One of your Neopets may have a dip in the Magma Pool. Please select your Neopet to take a swim in the Magma Pool and be painted Magma.</i>
Any time day or night. I had played no games, but fine all the worms. and get the lamp glowing.</li>
<li>- AoTA items collected 10. 24/7 access</li>
<li>- Was on my second time to collect the worms. clicked over at the Moltara Town Hall and he told me I had access to the pool. It has been a long time again. But I think that was the order of things.</li>
</ul><p>
<b>Rical</b><br></p><ul class="list"><li>- So my story is: last Friday I came upon this thread and read a bit of it. I've never really been interested in the Magma Pool and this thread made me remember that I still don't know what my Magma Pool time is. So that day I decided to visit the Pool semi-regularly and see if by any chance I end up finding out my time.</li>
<li>- So I just started visiting the pool at random times about 5-6 times a day, not really paying much attention to it, to see if I could eventually find my time.</li>
<li>- That's basically what I've been doing since last week and today wasn't the exception. I visited the Pool probably twice today and as usual the guard was awake and didn't let me pass. The last time I visited it was at around 3:41-3:51 pm NST (don't remember the exact time, sorry). And then, about 1 h later, at 4:40 pm NST I visited it once again and for no apparent reason the guard now told me that I'm allowed into the pool, and so far, it seems to be permanent.</li>
<li>- I don't think I've done anything differenly today from what usually do. If anything, I haven't really spent much time on the site today so this was really a surprise. I've considered the possibility of it being a bug, maybe someone in the programming staff is testing something *laugh* but for now, it looks permament</li>
<li>- Lately I don't really spend much time on the site. My routine is more or less: play Trudy's surprise, get the gifts from the Advent Calendar, buy some stocks in the Stock Market, check my shop and not much more. I usually bet on the Food Club daily but I haven't been doing that for the last 3-4 days.</li>
<li>- Well, last week wasn't really the first time ever I visited the Magma Pool. I've visited it quite a few times since the plot; I just never really started to visit it semi-regularly many times a day to try and find out my time until last Friday. but the 7 days after fulfilling the requirements seems like a good theory! Maybe I fulfilled them sometime before last week and then when I visited it on Friday the countdown started?</li>
<li>- These past 7 days I haven't done anything outside of the routine I described earlier. It seems werid to me that I got access today out of the blue for no apparent reason. Why today? Why not last week, or last month, or last year? I've never dipped any of my pets in the Pool before since, as I said, I never discovered what my time was. I just started to try to discover my time last week, but I don't remember doing anything unusual other than visiting the pool more regularly.</li>
<li>- I'm pretty sure I did the whole worm finding quest at least twice just after the plot ended. I haven't done it again in years, though.</li>
<li>- All I have in my inventory now are the gifts from the last 10 days of the Advent Calendar and a Basic Gift Box.</li>
<li>- As for Moltara, I haven't picked up any of the items there, found any worms or done anything in there since the plot ended. At most, I may have visited some of its places a few times for events like the Festival of Neggs or similar.</li>
<li>- So thinking about what we discussed yesterday, I do believe the key to unlocking full access must have something to do with the 7-day interval. What I think happened in my case is: Maybe I fulfilled the requirements a long time ago but, to unlock full access I needed to either 1) Visit the Magma Pool everyday for 7-8 days in a row or 2) Visit the Pool once and then again exactly one week later. I think both theories make sense considering how I seemed to gain full access out of nowhere</li>
<li>- I started checking the Pool on Friday 11th at 9:53 am. Continued checking it multiple times a day for the next week. I finally discovered I got permanent access on Friday 18th at 4:40 pm. I had checked the Pool just 1 hour before (at around 3:41-3:51 pm) and I didn't have access yet so it was during that 1h interval that I must have obtained it. Also it was during that interval that Vandoodle posted the cryptic number message which made me think he might have had smthing to do w it</li>
<li>- Silver AoTA trophy</li>
</ul><p>
<b>Herdy</b><br></p><ul class="list"><li>
- I know for a fact I've not spoken to Igneot since the launch of Moltara.</li>
<li>- And on that note - I unlocked access today. No idea how since this is the first time I have checked it in a few months since JN launched the checker for the sleeping guard time (at which point I did not have access).</li>
<li>- I have previously spoken to Ingeot years ago, though certainly not enough to get all of his responses.
</li><li>- I've found all the worms previously (again, years ago) and made all the petpets.</li>
<li>- My Tunnel Tumble high score is well over 650.</li>
<li>- The only recent thing I have done is today picked up a fresh lantern and the three available worms on the map (purple, red, and blue at that point). I clicked the pool and suddenly have access.</li>
<li>- Aside from collecting obsidian from the quarry daily, that is literally all I have done in Moltara in the last few months - so presumably I can't have done anything else to qualify.</li>
<li>- I have a (gold) AotA trophy.</li></ul><p>
