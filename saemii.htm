<blockquote>
<h2>June 2024</h2>
<p>The threat of invasion had hung over the ocean all spring. My father, a commodore in the Oshan army, had been busy with work. I'd kept my head down knowing there were more important things at stake than the fact that I missed my father. I went to school, kept up my grades, did my chores and though, at eleven years old, I no longer needed a babysitter, still visited my babysitter regularly to stave off my loneliness and boredom. It helped that she lived just next door. 
</p><p>	It was no surprise when the pirates finally attacked. My father had been preparing for months on what to do when the moment came. He had taught me how to defend myself, hoping that I would never have to but wanting me to have the know-how, just in case. He had told that when the pirates attacked and he was not with me, I was to bunker down where I was, if possible, or better yet, get home. 
</p><p>I was home when the attack began but I wasn't about to abandon my former babysitter or the other children under her care, either. I grabbed my father's mace and shield where he kept them in his bedroom. I raced next door when Leonard, a little Maraquan Kougra swam right into me. 
</p><p>."Pirate inside," he panted, eyes wide with fright. 
</p><p>."How many?" I asked tersely. 
</p><p>."I don't know! More than one!"
</p><p>,"Leo, listen to me. Go into my house, find the safe room next to the bathroom and stay there. I'm gonna help the others."
</p><p>I watched the little Kougra make it inside before entering the neighbor's. At once, I saw a red Jetsam pirate trying to corner Blue, a baby Jetsam. Naturally bitey and incredibly fast, he wasn't letting the pirate close, but he wouldn't be able to keep that up for long. 
</p><p>Taking the scene in at a glance, I didn't hesitate, ramming the red Jetsam from behind at full force and sending him flying into the nearest wall. He fell to the floor, unconscious. 
</p><p>."Hey, Blue! Let's get you to safety, yeah?" I spoke softly, uncertain whether the baby Jetsam would cooperate. I had nothing to worry about as he raced right to me. 
</p><p>Corrie, a Maraquan Kau and my former babysitter, rushed into the room. She gave me a surprised look. "Titanoros, what-"
</p><p>."I'm here to help. Leo's in the safe room at my place already. You take Blue and I'll gather up the others, okay?"
</p><p>."Okay," Corrie agreed, scooping Blue into her arms and leaving the house. 
</p><p>I went further into the house to find Margo, a Maraquan Moehog a year younger than me trying to wrangle the five-year-old Flotsam twins, Sunny, and Summer. 
</p><p>."Can't catch us!" one squeaked while the other made faces at Margo. 
</p><p>They both swam circles around Margo. 
</p><p>."Gotcha!" I exclaimed, snatching one of the twins as they swam past. 
</p><p>."Hey!" the other squeaked with indignation but this allowed Margo to grab them. 
</p><p>."Corrie, Leo, and Blue are in the safe room at my house. Can you manage the twins while I-"
</p><p>A scream of fright sent a jolt of alarm through all of us. 
</p><p>The twins very suddenly realized this was not a game and huddled under Margo's fins. 
</p><p>."They won't give me any trouble," Margo said. 
</p><p>They headed for the front door, and I headed further into the house. The next room had a little Maraquan Korbat cowering in a corner, a pirate Tuskaninny towering menacingly over her. 
</p><p>."Help, please!" Serena, the little Korbat, begged upon seeing me. 
</p><p>There went the element of surprise. 
</p><p>The pirate turned to face me, a cutlass in one flipper. He sneered at me, and I knew this was going to be a far different fight from the last. 
</p><p>."What's this? A boy pretending to be a soldier? Git outta here afore I show you what a real fighter looks like."
</p><p>."Swim, Serena!" I yelled, charging the pirate. 
</p><p>His cutlass met my horn, and the battle was joined. 
</p><p>Each time I tried to attack, he parried with his blade. My hide was tough, but I wasn't used to a prolonged fight. Then, he got a slash down my side. It was the worst pain I had ever experienced and as the water turned red, he grinned evilly at me. He seemed to think I was finished but I wasn't about to give up. At least I could be comforted by the fact that, even if I didn't make it, at least I had saved everyone else. 
</p><p>."Need a little help?" a familiar voice asked from behind me. 
</p><p>I felt a rush of relief so strong I almost cried. It was Salvator, a Maraquan Krawk, and one of my father's most trusted crew members. His pale-yellow eyes glinted with a fierce light and his grin was self-assured. He held his fighting staff easily in his webbed fins. 
</p><p>Uncertainty flashed in the pirate's eyes at this change in opponents. Then he scoffed. "You brought a stick to a sword fight?"
</p><p>Salvator's face never wavered. "Go ahead. Make my day."
</p><p>With that, the battle was joined. It took only a few deft moves for Sal to knock the pirate out. With the threat neutralized, he immediately turned his attention to me. 
</p><p>."How you doin', kid?" Sal asked. 
</p><p>."Hurt but is everyone else safe?" I asked anxiously. 
</p><p>."Yeah, they are thanks to you. Now, lets get you checked out."
</p><p>Sal helped me to the nearest triage station. I would be left with a scar, but I would survive and, most importantly, my neighbor and her young charges had, too. It was only after I had been patched up that I learned my father had been severely wounded. By the time I arrived at the infirmary he was out of danger, but it would be a long hard road to recovery. We had both been through some tough things that day, but we <i>had</i> made it. 
</p><p>."Sal told me what you did today," Father said. "You could have stayed safe but instead you put yourself in harm's way to save others. Not everyone would have done that."
</p><p>."I couldn't bear the thought of hiding while innocent 'pets were hurt or worse if there was something I could do about it."
</p><p>Father grasped my flipper in his. "I'm proud of you, son."

<h2>May 2024</h2>
<p>	."Hey, cool guy?"
</p><p>.	"Yeah, hot girl?"
</p><p>	Tor was on the floor, leaning against the bed while Divine sat on the bed. It was unusual for him to have to look up at her. Usually, he towered over her much shorter frame so this was a change. 
</p><p>.	"Do you remember when you first called me that?" Divine asked. 
</p><p>	Tor winced. "How could I forget? Not my best moment." 
</p><p>.	"Actually, I've never acknowledged just what you did for me that day."
</p><p>	Tor arced a brow. "What do you mean?"
</p><p>	Divine dropped to sit next to Tor, close enough to touch. It had taken quite some time to get to this point. Her being a fire elemental and him being an ice elemental, their elements weren't exactly compatible. So, being able to sit side by side like this was not something they took for granted. She looked up at him now, more serious than Tor had ever seen her. 
</p><p>.	"Before that moment, I had no idea that I was an Ignis."
</p><p>	Tor frowned. "What do you mean?"
</p><p>.	"I mean, Tor, that my power never showed itself until that moment where I confronted you."
</p><p>	Tor studied Divine's face but she was clearly in earnest. He shook his head slowly, trying to understand. "But that doesn't make sense. Why did you go to the Academy if it was only for elementals? And every elemental presents some sign of their element on their thirteenth birthday. Even I did that and I'm-" He shrugged his shoulders in a helpless gesture. It had been years since then but he still struggled with being the only ice elemental in existence and how difficult that transition had been for him. 
</p><p>	Divine placed a hand over his, comforting him even now. "This was before the Mage War. I can only guess that the Nomalans were trying to find a way in to the Academy and they were able to work that out due to my parents' greed." A hint of bitterness coloured the girl's tone. "As for the second thing, I don't have an explanation for that, Tor but that's what happened."
	</p><p>Tor sat in silence for a moment, trying to reason it out. Then, titled his head as something occurred to him. "Well, normally, our powers are triggered by heightened emotion. Do you think you weren't allowed to feel while at home? That you were only able to really feel things once you got away from your parents?"
	</p><p>."No, that's ridiculous. Of course, I felt things!" Divine began to protest but stopped as she began to think about what her friend said. Living with her parents before the Academy had been pretty unbearable, even if she didn't realize it at the time. She'd had plenty of feelings but hadn't necessarily been able to express them. It was pointless, given that her parents just didn't care about her, let alone what she felt. It hadn't been until she'd left home that she'd been able to express herself openly. "Well, now that I think about it, that does make sense." She sighed, leaning against Tor as she usually did when she needed that extra bit of comfort. "I know one thing."
	</p><p>."What's that?" Tor asked, resting his head atop hers. 
	</p><p>."It all worked out in the end."

<blockquote>
<h2>April 2024</h2>
<p>	It was a beautiful day in Meridell. The sun shone down from a clear blue sky. As a result, the marketplace was more crowded than ever with sellers and shoppers alike. One such shopper was a familiar figure in the village.  An elderly Yurble with an empty bag slung on one shoulder entered the marketplace as was his daily habit. 
</p><p>	His first stop was at a stall selling an assortment of baked goods. 
</p><p>.	"Good morning, Art!" The biscuit Kau running the stall greeted the Yurble with a warm smile. 
</p><p>.	"Good morning, Cass!" the old Yurble greeted in return. 
</p><p>	The two of them had only known each other since childhood. Each had made their lives in Meridell, settling down and raising their families. Now they were both grandparents. Cassidy still ran a successful baked goods business while Art had essentially retired now that his wife was gone and his children were grown. 
</p><p>.	"What'll it be today?" Cass asked. 
</p><p>.	"I'll take a cherry tart for myself and what do you have to share with the family later?" Art raised his bushy eyebrows at Cass. 
</p><p>.	"How about a lemon meringue pie?"
</p><p>.	"Perfect!"
</p><p>.	"Here you go, Mr. Yubby," Chloe, Cass' eldest daughter, said, handing him a box with his purchases inside. 
</p><p>.	"Thank you, dear. How are those children of yours?" Mr. Yubby, as the old Yurble was called, asked. 
</p><p>.	"Doing well! They're around here somewhere. I'm sure you'll see them."
</p><p>.	"I'm sure I will. Take care now," Mr. Yubby said, continuing his way through the market. 
	</p><p>The old Yurble paused to watch a Quiggle bard play his lute, eating his cherry tart in a few bites. 
</p><p>	Mr. Yubby had known the Fairwaters for three generations. They were a lively bunch of Quiggles so it had been a surprise to no one when young Willie Fairwaters had picked up the lute to pursue the life of a minstrel. He was a natural at his craft, entertaining the small crowd with a funny song about a Mortog princess. He hopped around, feathered cap tilted jauntily atop his head as he strummed his lute and sang at the top of his lungs, urging the crowd to sing and clap along. As the song finished, Mr. Yubby moved on, knowing he had other errands to run. 
</p><p>	Next, he stopped at the Bancroft Kitchen booth. The Bancrofts were a young Meerca couple that had decided to start a food kitchen. It had grown faster than expected and anyone that needed a good meal could find one at their Kitchen. They had a broad selection of fruits and veggies, all grown in the surrounding countryside. While they gladly gave out free meals, they also sold any surplus to those that chose to support the Kitchen that way. 
</p><p>.	"Good morning, Mr. Yubby!" Bell Bancroft greeted, her five-month-old son, Benedict, gurgling happily in her arms. 
</p><p>.	"Good morning, Bell! And you too, little Ben!" Mr. Yubby responded, waving to the baby. "How goes the sales?"
</p><p>.	"Good, as usual. Folks love their fresh fruits and veggies and your honey always sells out quick. We've got a bunch of donations to load up as well."
</p><p>	Mr. Yubby beamed at this. He was proud to donate what he could. 
</p><p>.	"Mornin'!" Russ, a red Kyrii and the Kitchen manager, paused in loading up crates of food onto the delivery cart. 
</p><p>	There was no sign of Skip, the Kitchen assistant, but that was no surprise. Skip was possibly the laziest 'pet in Neopia. When there was work to be done, the burlap Ixi could be counted on to make himself scarce. 
</p><p>	Mr. Yubby waved to Russ and continued on his way. 
</p><p>	Just a few stalls down was his family's honey stall. His daughter, Beth, was helping customers but she smiled at him in acknowledgement. Not wanting to disturb her, he waved and moved on. 
</p><p>	Passing an alley full of boxes, burlap sacks and barrels, Mr. Yubby's eye was caught by a foot sticking out. He raised a bushy brow at this. At first, he was just going to pass by but then decided to stop. He could hear soft snores coming from the alley. He cleared his throat but got no response. 
</p><p>	He rapped his walking stick on the nearest crate and this got a scruffy looking Doglefox to stumble out, a leaf stuck to his ear. He stretched and yawned. Spotting Mr. Yubby, he wagged his tail in recognition. This only confirmed Mr. Yubby's suspicions about who was sleeping in the alley. The elderly Yurble stepped into the alley to see a burlap Ixi sprawled asleep on some sacks. 
</p><p>	Mr. Yubby nudged the sleeping Ixi with his walking stick. 
</p><p>	The Ixi shifted in his sleep, brushing the walking stick away. 
</p><p>	Mr. Yubby snorted. He shook the Ixi's shoulder. "Skip!"
</p><p>.	"Five more minutes, Russ!" Skip whined, turning and snuggling deeper into the burlap sack he was resting on. 
</p><p>.	"Skip, this isn't Russ. Its Mr. Yubby," the old Yurble tried again, this time with no response. He looked over at Wes, the Doglefox in disbelief. "Well, I tried."
	</p><p>Wes trotted over and hopped lightly on top of his owner's reclined form. He gave a sharp bark and this did the trick. 
</p><p>	Skip sat up with a start, looking around with bleary eyes (or as bleary as buttons can look). "Huh, what? What is it?"
</p><p>.	"Shouldn't you be helping your friends at the Kitchen?" Mr. Yubby asked. 
</p><p>.	"Oh, yeah! I was just resting my eyes for a moment, is all," Skip said, getting to his feet. 
</p><p>	Having gotten the lazy Ixi moving, Mr. Yubby returned to the marketplace to finish his errands. Bag now bulging at his side, Mr. Yubby went home and put his belongings away. He deserved a rest after that. Pleased with the productive morning, the old Yurble eased into the rocker on his porch with a sigh. He rocked in his chair, content to let the rest of the day happen as it would.

<h2>March 2024</h2>
<p>It was a beautiful day in the Woods, a gray fog obscured the trees but not the leaves having turned their splendid colours for fall like a warm plaid quilt. It was my favourite sort of day so why did I feel a sense of foreboding? It was a feeling I had come to respect over the years. I didn't feel this way for any reason other than something bad was going to happen and soon. The problem was, I had no idea what it could be. 
</p><p>	I resolved to be on my guard for whatever trouble was coming to Crossroads. 
</p><p>.	"Stella, is everything alright?" Cloudy, a grey Kougra, asked me with concern in his soft brown eyes. 
</p><p>	I mustered a reassuring smile. "Yes, Cloudy. Everything's fine."
</p><p>	He breathed a soft sigh, and I could tell he didn't believe me, but he didn't press the matter. He merely followed me as we made our way down the stairs. 
</p><p>	We were quickly swept up in the noisy busyness of breakfast at Crossroads. As I took my place at the table, I reminded myself that those that I cherished most were all present. We were all healthy and safe. Whatever was coming we would face together. Though, I knew that I would bear the brunt of the burden as they all looked to me to protect and guide them. 
</p><p>	It was a burden I took on willingly. The Woods were a dangerous place to live but home, nevertheless. My house-situated at the halfway point on the only road that ran through it-had quickly become a haven for the lost and alone. Those that couldn't defend themselves or were simply too soft-hearted to make their way through the Woods on their own. They had refuge here and I quickly had a host of regulars that helped me run this little place we called Crossroads. 
</p><p>	The house was a simple two-story clapboard with plenty of windows and a front porch on one side. It was big enough to accommodate twenty-four residents though it would be a bit of a squeeze. We had a big kitchen and dining area, along with a sitting room. It had no sign or distinguishing features but everyone that visited said it felt like home. This house had seen many things, both happy and sad, and it had served its purpose well.
</p><p>	Despite my unease, the day passed without incident. The sun burned away the fog and we went about our normal routine with regular upkeep on the house. With as many visitors as we had on a regular basis, there was always something that needed doing! Night falls early in the Woods and, just when I was beginning to feel that we would be able to have a peaceful end to the day, I felt a rush of something that told me that the bad thing I had been anticipating all day had finally arrived. 
</p><p>	Abe, a grey Lupe and my second in command came running. "It's Dante. He's here and he's not alone."
</p><p>	I rushed to the nearest window to see a tall, scrawny Darigan Bori glaring darkly at Crossroads. As I looked closer, he could see other dark, menacing eyes peering through the gloom of the night, all of them fixed on my home. When his red eyes caught sight of me, his fanged maw lifted into a smirk. With a flick of a claw, he sent his group of bandits charging straight for us. 
</p><p>	 Having been caught unawares and inside, I was unable to stop the attack entirely by using a force field. Besides, I could either use a force field or fight, not both. There was also no telling whether Dante and his cronies would set themselves up for a siege, trapping us for who knew how long. Though it looked like we were outnumbered, especially with our varying degree of fighting ability, it was better to fight than to resign ourselves to a slow, torturous end. 
</p><p>.	"Rally the ot-" I began before I heard the front door open and glass shatter below. 
</p><p>	An alarmed shout that sounded like Trixie, a Halloween Ixi, made me and Abe scramble for the door. 
</p><p>	Cloudy stumbled out of his room, wide-eyed with alarm. "What's happening?"
</p><p>.	"Dominik," Astraea, an eventide Scorchio said grimly, the crac.kle of flame already gathering in her throat as she took flight over the railing to charge downstairs. 
	</p><p>."It's going to be alright, Cloudy," I said, trying to sound more reassuring than I felt. 
</p><p>	Once more, I could see he didn't believe me but there wasn't time to do anything else. I charged down the stairs with Abe on my heels only to be halted in my tracks by a brawny Yurble bearing a war hammer. 
</p><p>	He roared, raising his hammer to swing. 
</p><p>	I ducked and his hammer smashed into the wall. 
</p><p>	With an angry roar, he pulled his hammer free, but this allowed the others to get by. 
</p><p>	It took a few more moments before I was able to deal with the Yurble and follow my friends down the stairs. A skirmish had broken out throughout the house and my heart leapt into my throat as I saw the fallen form of one of my friends. Thankfully, someone else helped him to his feet and they continued. We were badly outnumbered, and I wondered how long we would be able to fend off our attackers. 
</p><p>.	"Fire!"
</p><p>	The shout came from Augustus, a mutant Bruce, who had once been one of Dominik's minions but had long-since been a dear friend. 
</p><p>	I knew then that Crossroads was lost. All I cared about now was that my friends and I got out alive. We stumbled out, our foes still coming at us from all sides. Two of my friends were badly injured and I wanted to see to them, but I couldn't do that in the thick of the fight. 
</p><p>	Suddenly, Dominik was in front of me, blade drawn. His eyes gleamed with malice, and I knew there was only one way to finish this. 
</p><p>	In an instant, the battle was joined. 
</p><p>	I was a stellar fighter but so was my opponent. I fought with all my might, but I had worked hard all day and Dominik appeared fresh. It wasn't long before Dominik struck a fatal blow and I stumbled back, where a few of my surviving friends had formed a protective ring. 
</p><p>	With the last of my strength, I raised a force field but knew it wouldn't last long.
	</p><p>Dominik's malevolent gaze never left mine and he smirked to see me defeated. With a flick of his hand, his minions fell back into the shelter of the trees, as swiftly and silently as they had come. 
</p><p>	Everything I had built over the years was nothing more than a smoldering ruin. 
	</p><p>Crossroads had been a safe haven in a place full of nothing more than darkness and evil. I had stood alone, offering peace and safety to all those that needed it. I had fought fiercely for the helpless souls that had come to rely upon me to protect them. 
	</p><p>But I had failed. 
</p><p>	Crossroads had fallen, my friends lost or scattered. In the end, the forces of evil had prevailed. As darkness overwhelmed me, the only thing came to mind.
</p><p>Nothing lasts forever.

<p><i>Thank you to <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=atomic_sushi">Zim</a> for allowing me to use their characters, <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=Dorithae">Dorithae</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=Mhadyx">Mhadyx</a> for this prompt. I had so much fun writing about our characters again!
	</i></p><p>."Alright, class now that we've completed our study of fairytales, it's time for our final assignment to complete the section," Mr. Vandal, their literature teacher said. "Now that you've become familiar with fairytales and their various elements its your turn to apply what you've learned and write your own."
	</p><p>There was a collective groan from the class, including from Vlad and his two Wocky companions, who were the loudest of all. On the inside however, Chad was thrilled. Having been born and raised in Faerieland, he actually enjoyed fairytales and was an avid storyteller himself. He had breezed through this section while much of the others had floundered, put off by the material. He knew he had this assignment in the bag. Of course, given his carefully curated persona Vlad, he had to pretend otherwise. 
	</p><p>So, he feigned boredom and rude comments along with his friends Kylleon and Val. Things only changed when he was safely behind closed doors. He peeled off his vampire costume as he went and by the time he reached his room he was fully Chad again. Tossing his satchel aside, he pulled out his tape recorder, clicked it on, scooped up a stress ball shaped like a carrot and began to pace. Ever active, he had learned that he worked best when he could talk it out, keep his hands busy and stay moving. This done, he began to talk. 
	</p><p>."OK, so, once upon a time, there was an evil vampire trapped in a maze. He couldn't find his way out no matter how hard he tried because not only was it a maze but there were traps and other things designed to keep everyone that entered it trapped there forever. There were other monsters trapped in the maze, too but unlike him, they <i>liked</i> the maze. But here's the thing," here Chad paused, the stress ball squeezed tight in one hand, "he wasn't really evil," he continued softly. "He was actually a prince cursed by a dark faerie to become a vampire and, having mistaken him for a monster, he had been locked away in the maze for the rest of his undead life. So, he wandered the maze, hopeless and alone, longing for the day when he could be free all while living a lie in order to protect his secret identity."
	</p><p>Chad's gaze drifted to a picture that he had over his desk. It was of himself, a burlap Kau, and a baby Gelert with their arms around each other as they made silly faces. The picture made him smile on his worst days. He had met the pair of sisters a couple years ago and they had become fast friends. In fact, Chad considered them the only <i>real</i> friends he had; they were the only ones that knew his secret. 
	</p><p>."Little did he know that his liberation was close at hand in the form of a young maiden named Dorothea, on a quest to save her sister Madyxa who had been abducted by a bunch of bandits. She had been told that the evil vampire would be able to help her get her sister back. So, equipped with a ball of yarn, a sharp sword, and a sharper wit, she entered the maze. The way was fraught with danger, but Dorothea persevered and eventually found the evil vampire."
	</p><p>Dorothea trapped the evil vampire with ease and, being a clever maiden, she saw right through his pretense. "You're not an evil vampire at all, are you?"
	</p><p>Unused to being discovered, he sighed. "No, I'm not. My name is Chaddeus and I'm actually a prince that was cursed by a dark faerie to become a vampire."
	</p><p>."Oh," Dorothea said. "But if you're not an evil vampire after all then that means you can't help me." 
	</p><p>."What did you need help with?"
	</p><p>Dorothea told Chaddeus her story. 
	</p><p>."If you get me out of here, I'll help you get your sister back!"
	</p><p>."And maybe break your curse after?" Dorothea gave Chaddeus a genuine smile, the first he'd seen in a very long time. "Then let's go!"
	</p><p>Having come to an agreement, the pair of young heroes escaped the maze. Through a series of adventures, they vanquished real evil and eventually reached the forest that served as the bandit stronghold. When they'd gotten only part of the way through it, Madyxa found them, having escaped the bandits herself. 
	</p><p>."I don't need rescuing!" Madyxa declared, blowing a raspberry at her sister. 
	</p><p>."Maybe you don't but I still do," Chaddeus said. 
	</p><p>."Who is this guy?" Madyxa asked her sister. 
	</p><p>."This is Chaddeus, a prince put under a curse by a dark faerie. In exchange for his help in rescuing you, I agreed to help him break the curse," Dorothea explained. 
	</p><p>."And how are <i>we</i> gonna do that?"
	</p><p>."The curse can only be broken by eating a plum from a magical plum tree," Chaddeus explained. "The good news is that it's located somewhere in this very forest. The bad news is that we still have to find it."
	</p><p>."Then we better get started," Dorothea said. 
	</p><p>Through yet another series of adventures in the forest, they finally found the magic plum tree. Just as Chaddeus was about to climb the plum tree, there was a high-pitched whistle and a rush of purple feathers. A giant mutant Beekadoodle was guarding the tree! Thinking quickly, Dorothea and Chaddeus unfurled a net that they had picked up on their travels. 
	</p><p>."Keep it busy, Madyxa," Dorothea ordered. 
	</p><p>."Why me?" Madyxa yelped as she ran in a zigzag pattern, trying to evade the Beekadoodle. 
	</p><p>Dorothea exchanged a look with Chaddeus, who nodded. 
	</p><p>."Alright, we're ready," Dorothea said. "Draw it over here, Madyxa!"
	</p><p>Madyxa darted between her sister and Chaddeus. Once she was clear, they raised the net and the Beekadoodle flew right into it! Working together, they quickly weighted the net and even though the Beekadoodle struggled fiercely, it couldn't break free. 
	</p><p>With the tree now unguarded, Chaddeus was able to climb the tree and pluck a plum from its branches. Prize secured, he carefully made his way back down. He looked at the two young maidens who had helped him get to this moment, feeling incredibly grateful. Throat suddenly tight with emotion, he found he couldn't speak but Dorothea seemed to understand. 
</p><p>The Kau maiden gave him an encouraging nod. 
</p><p>."Eat it already!" Madyxa exclaimed, ever impatient. 
</p><p>Chaddeus needed no further prompting. He took a bite of the plum, its sweetness filling his mouth and the juice dripping down his chin. 
	</p><p>."Did it work?" he asked, swallowing the bite he'd just taken. 
</p><p>.	"I think so if your new eye colour is any indication," Dorothea said. "Do you feel any different?"
</p><p>	His mouth felt strangely empty without fangs, and he no longer felt this deep thirst or the sun burning his pelt. 
</p><p>.	"I feel like myself again, I think. It's been so long I barely remember what it feels like to not be a monster." He heaved a breath and managed a smile. "I'm free!"
</p><p>	The trio laughed and hugged in shared delight. 
	</p><p>With Madyxa reunited with Dorothea and Chaddeus' curse broken, the three of them could finally go home and live happily ever after."
	</p><p>Chad clicked off his recorder and grinned. "That's it!"
	</p><p>He quickly shot an e-mail to Dorithae and Mhadyx and attached the audio he'd just recorded. <i>I hope you don't mind that I used the two of you for a school assignment</i>, he typed out before hitting send. 
	</p><p>He leaned back in his chair, hands cupped behind his head with a satisfied smile. He had this assignment in the bag!

<h2>January 2024</h2>
<p>.	"Look, Lunello. Do you remember when we helped this tree? It was just a sapling then but see how it's grown!" Solunad, the faerie Grundo, extended her arm so that Lunello, her mutant Clompkin, could make his way from her shoulder to the tree. 
</p><p>	Lunello secured himself to the tree's trunk with his tentacles. They busily worked across the tree's thick bark, assessing the health of the tree as the mutant Clompkin grinned at his companion. 
</p><p>	It had been over a decade since Solunad had left Kreludor to come to Neopia. Her family had been happy for her but the only reason she had gone at all was because her sister had asked. They may have lived on the moon but even they had heard the terrible news that Faerieland had fallen. Solunad's family was even more anxious because Skye, her older sister, had moved there a few years prior. They were relieved to hear from her at last.
</p><p>	That's when Skye asked Solunad to come to Neopia to help with Faerieland's recovery efforts. 
</p><p>	Not one to refuse her family anything and deeply moved by the tragedy, Solunad agreed. What a chaotic time it had been! The destruction had been severe, and recovery, reunification and restoration efforts were all underway. Of course, Solunad, having never left Kreludor, also had intense culture shock to deal with. Though, she didn't let that stop her from jumping right in and helping wherever she could. 
</p><p>	This was when she discovered two things: she had sleep-related magic and a green thumb. With just a touch, she could soothe anxieties and help even the most restless to settle. With just a word, she could ease someone to sleep. She could even influence dreams! She quickly developed a sleep potion to pass out to others that desperately needed it so she could do the most good. 
</p><p>	 Along with that, she was almost immediately fascinated by all the flora. The earth faeries took her under their wings when they learned about her interest. She befriended one named Idalia who had a faerie Minitheus with flower-growing magic. While her won magic didn't align with theirs, she loved learning all about the sheer variety of Neopia's flora. She would never forget when she applied her new knowledge and was rewarded with a seed blossoming into a flower for the very first time. 
</p><p>	It was also during this time that Solunad made a new, unexpected friend. Faerieland had fallen in an area that meant the Haunted Woods was their closest neighbor. While some Woods' folk took advantage of the faeries, many also stepped up to help like so many others across Neopia. Their help was invaluable as-while most of the wraiths had been dealt with-a few still prowled the outskirts. The Woods folk weren't daunted by the task at hand and had their own darker magic to rely on. 
	</p><p>Knowing the dangers and still learning her own powers, Solunad was careful not to go too far alone. So it was that Solunad was on the outskirts along with a few others. While she hadn't been taught to fear much of anything, she knew that ignorance was the biggest thing she had to worry about. In a damaged section of woodland, Solunad's attention was caught by a strange sight: a dark blue, almost black creature with an oversized, round head, with glowing, crescent shaped eyes and mouth, a thick vine-like body, and tentacles. It was the most alien thing Solunad had seen since she'd arrived in Neopia. 
</p><p>	The creature was on a tree and a sick one at that. They were unfortunately all too familiar a sight. Most of its leaves were gone, many of its branches were broken and the entire tree looked dull and almost droopy, as if it had lost the will to live. Solunad watched as the creature spread his tentacles across the tree's trunk as far as they would go. Then, he began to sway, almost hypnotically and his eyes and mouth seemed to glow more intensely. 
</p><p>	Solunad almost couldn't believe her eyes when the creature began to grow. He had been maybe the size of a small potted plant but there was no doubt he was growing. After a few moments he stopped swaying and was now about the size of a small shrub. He released the tree and returned to the forest floor. His tentacles swept across the forest floor; he appeared to be looking for something. 
	</p><p>Looking at the tree he had left, it seemed improved. It was no longer dull and lifeless. Gaze trailing up to its branches, it appeared that buds were beginning to grow. 
</p><p>.	"What is that thing?!" Idalia asked with some alarm as she and Rosey, her faerie Minitheus, joined Solunad. 
</p><p>.	"I don't know. I was going to ask you," Solunad said. 
</p><p>.	"And what is it doing to that poor sapling?"
</p><p>	The creature had discovered a sapling and was wrapping his tentacles around its base. He made no attempt to climb it but began to sway, eyes and mouth glowing. 
</p><p>.	"We have to stop it before it hurts that sapling!" Idalia exclaimed. 
</p><p>.	"No wait. It was just doing the same thing to this tree but I think he's helping them," Solunad said. 
</p><p>	Idalia frowned but put her hand on the tree and closed her eyes. After a moment, she opened them to look at Solunad. "You're right. He did help this tree. But how?"
</p><p>	Solunad could only shake her head. 
</p><p>	The sapling began to glow the same bright gold as the creature's eyes. This time, Idalia and Solunad both saw the creature shrink instead of grow. When he finished swaying, he was once more the size of a houseplant. He released the sapling and began his search once more. 
</p><p>.	"Huh, a mutant Clompkin. You don't see too many of those around," a mutant Lutari named Oren said as he joined them. 
</p><p>Are they nice?" Solunad asked. 
</p><p>.	"They are," Oren confirmed with a nod. 
</p><p>	That was all Solunad needed to hear. She approached the mutant Clompkin at once. "Hey there. My name is Solunad. We're helping the trees, too, and we would love for you to join us. So, what do you say?"
</p><p>	The mutant Clompkin paused to smile up at her and the rest was history. 
	</p><p>That little sapling from so long ago was a big, strong tree now. With a little help, a little encouragement, and a little guidance, it had gone from a scrawny, delicate little thing that couldn't even stand up straight on it's own to a central part of the forest it lived in, providing food and shelter to the Petpets that called it home. 
</p><p>	After all, that's all anyone ever really needed, Solunad reflected. Whether they were a sapling, a stranger in a new place, or a Petpet with an unusual ability, all they had needed was a chance to grow.

<h2>December 2023</h2>
<p>	Night had fallen on the Tyrannian Plateau. As was customary, bonfires were lit to ward off the darkness and the chill that quickly took hold when the sun set. These bonfires dotted the plateau blazing like stars fallen to the earth. Tyrannians gathered around their local bonfire to share news, meet up with family and old friends and eat a good meal. Though, one of the most important customs was the sharing of stories. 
</p><p>	These stories were told to teach valuable life lessons and pass on the long history of Tyrannia. The best ones, of course, were those that talked about Tyrannian heroes, past and present or great battles won and lost. As was common with stories, they were changed and embellished with time and teller. These were the stories told so often that they became the heartbeat of every Tyrannian. The ones that reminded them to have faith in themselves because they were Tyrannians and Tyrannians were survivors. 
</p><p>Some storytellers were more popular than others. One could always tell where they were because those bonfires had the biggest crowds but also the quietest. These were the storytellers that could hold an audience captive with their very words, transporting them into the story so that they felt like they were the hero. They were the ones that could make even an old, familiar story feel brand new. So, it was no wonder that Tyrannians young and old clambered to hear from these storytellers. 
</p><p>One such storyteller stood now, thick gray fur patched with scars, long ivory tusks and amber eyes gleaming in the firelight. The muscle rippled across his shoulders as he demonstrated a particular moment of action. His shadow was cast upon the wall behind him enhancing his already massive frame. His voice rumbled as he spoke. This was Jumangye, a Tyrannian Lupe who was popular because he told (mostly) true tales detailing his own adventures in Tyrannia.   
</p><p>."Just when I thought I was free, he grabbed me in his toothy maw. I looked that scaly beast right in the eye and I could see he thought he had me. But I wasn't beat yet! With a swing of my tusks, I nailed 'im right in the eye. With an outraged roar, he released me. I scrambled to my feet and made my escape."
</p><p>One little Moehog gasped. "You didn't give up?"
</p><p>."I thought for sure you were a goner!" a Tyrannian Bruce exclaimed. 
</p><p>."Nope!" Juma gave a toss of his head.
</p><p>."But how? What made you keep fighting even in such a hopeless situation?" a Tyrannian Kyrii pressed. 
</p><p>Juma straightened to his full height and looked around at his audience with a knowing smile. "Because I'm a Tyrannian and Tyrannians are survivors. Even when it looks like you've reached the end of the beaten path, you have to keep making your own way forward. After all, if I've gotten this far, I know I can go just a little bit farther. I believe in myself because, after everything I've been through, I know I can handle anything that comes my way."

<h2>November 2023</h2>
<p>It started, as it always did, with a single feather.
</p><p>Snowflake awoke that morning to find a brown feather left in her moccasins. Being a blue Bruce herself, the feather did not belong to her. Her gaze drifted up to see Tommy, her Gobbler, still sleeping in the elevated natural wooden bowl he used as his nest. Normally, he was up whenever she was. This only meant one thing: moulting season had begun.
</p><p>Snowflake swept her hand along her Gobbler's body as she always did first thing in the morning. He shifted and clucked, irritated at her touch. Normally affectionate, she didn't take his moodiness personally. It was only to be expected. Being a Bruce, she could relate to her feathered friend's condition. 
</p><p>Moulting season lasted roughly about a month. Feathers were shed in stages, making Tommy look rather patchy and unkempt until his brand-new feathers finally grew in. His normally pleasant nature was replaced with irritability and fatigue. He was also hungry all the time. Growing feathers was a lot of work!
</p><p>Snowflake knew exactly what to do.
</p><p>The blue Bruce gave her Gobbler plenty of space and kept him fed with his favourite high protein treats and meals. She let him sleep as much as he wanted and where he wanted. Without his feathers, he got cold easily and didn't like hard surfaces. So, she made sure to keep plenty of pillows and blankets around for him to choose from. In short, she did everything she could to keep him happy and healthy during his moult.
</p><p>She also had to deal with feathers.
</p><p>Lots and lots of feathers!
</p><p>They were everywhere. Not just in Tommy's nest but scattered across the rest of the furniture and trailing along the floor. They were in piles in random corners and swept up into mini flurries whenever there was a draft from an open door. They drifted through the air whenever Tommy moved and made it easy for Snowflake to track his movements even if she couldn't see him. There were so many that she couldn't quite keep up.
</p><p>His biggest, finest feathers could be used for decorating, given as gifts or sold as souvenirs (though she didn't make a habit of that if a tourist butted into a conversation she was trying to have with a friend <i>offering</i> to buy, who was she to stop them?). Of course, a Gobbler shedding all of his feathers in such a short amount of time meant that
she soon enough ran out of ideas of what do with them. While she enjoyed a clean house as much as the next 'pet, moulting season was the one time of year when she had to just let it go. She only cleaned what she actively used and left the rest be. But, it was only a month and then it was all over.
</p><p>One morning, Tommy awoke with a happy cluck and an affectionate nuzzle for Snowflake. His feathers were all shiny and new. The brown, blue, red and black feathers shimmered in the light. She complimented her Petpet warmly and he strutted proudly, wings and tail fanned out on full display. This moulting season had gone off without a hitch!

<h2>October 2023</h2>
<p>Night had fallen in Shenkuu.
	</p><p>The moon was barely a sliver in the sky but even if it were full, it's light could not penetrate the darkness of the evergreen forest. But that suited The Mist just fine. It was one of the reasons they used the forest as one of their many hidden bases across the Shenkuuvian mountains. They were there now, having made camp for the night. They were settled around their smokeless fire, talking quietly amongst themselves. 
	</p><p>Their leader, a stealthy Draik, watched her bandits from hooded sky-blue eyes. 
	</p><p>A green Krawk scowled at a Darigan Grarrl. He grinned, showing off his many teeth in a smile that made even grown adults tremble. But not the Krawk. She met his bold gaze with her own. She spat something venomous to him and he didn't flinch, merely growled something in reply. 
	</p><p>Next to the Krawk, a faerie Xweetok rolled her jade green eyes at their conversation, clearly not impressed with anything either of them had to say. As leader of the Jade Paw, they were long-time partners of The Mist. With her nearby, no matter how heated an argument got, things wouldn't get out of hand. 
	</p><p>A Tyrannian Eyrie sprawled nearby, apparently oblivious to the argument brewing. Only his crested ears belied the fact that he was not as indifferent as he appeared. While a foreigner to Shenkuu, he had adapted quickly to mountain life. His formidable appearance wasn't all for show; he was one of the biggest and strongest bandits in The Mist. While aggressive, he was fiercely protective of the group that had saved his life. 
	</p><p>Across the fire from them, a lanky mutant Gelert yawned and stretched, flopping lazily on his side; he was by far the gentlest of the bandits. He didn't really belong with the bandits but once he had joined them, he had never left. 
</p><p>Almost invisible in the darkness save for the gleam of her yellow eyes, a Halloween Kougra crouched before pouncing on the unsuspecting Gelert. Startled by this attack, he floundered to stand, the Kougra quick to avoid his oversized paws. Once he realized that he wasn't in danger, the Gelert wagged his tail at the Kougra and gave a happy play bow, bouncing towards her, eager for a game.
	</p><p>The game elicited a burst of laughter from a woodland Lutari. While the same age as the mutant Gelert, he also had no business being a bandit. He treated banditry as a great game and didn't take anything seriously. He wouldn't even be there if it weren't for the fact that he was brother to the faerie Xweetok. So, for better or worse, he was there to stay. 
	</p><p>A shadow Korbat, invisible until that moment, hushed the Lutari with a pointed glare. Having realized her mistake at causing a fuss in the first place, the Kougra quickly ended her game and padded silently over to sit beside the Korbat. The Gelert, confused, sat next to the Lutari with a disappointed sigh but quickly thumped his tail happily as the Lutari started talking with him.   
	</p><p>Nearby, a brown Ixi shook her head at their antics but didn't interfere. She could be prickly, but she was smart and fast and loyal. While she acted like she didn't care, deep down she had a good heart. But bandits couldn't afford to be soft. Like the rest of them, she had simply learned to build an impenetrable wall around it. 
	</p><p>On the Ixi's other side, a brown Bori sat hunched, a small frown marring his features. He was by far the jumpiest of the bunch. Small, quiet, and shy, even after being with The Mist for close to a decade now, he didn't seem to be bandit material. Yet, he had an innate ability to become invisible, even in plain sight as he was plain and unassuming, which made him easy to overlook. He was also a stellar lookout and one of the first to pick up on if something was off. He was an integral part of The Mist. 
	</p><p>Beside the Bori was a camouflage Cybunny and the reason he stayed at all. The Cybunny kept up a steady, mostly one-sided conversation with the Bori. The Cybunny's big mouth had caused some trouble over the years. Thankfully, his mouth wasn't the only fast thing about it. It was only his speed and light fingers that kept him with The Mist.
	</p><p>Almost directly across from the bandit leader sat two Buzz, one camouflage and one speckled. Twins, they shared almost nothing in common besides that fact. The camouflage Buzz was fast and cunning, quick to make the first move. Thankfully, she had no aspirations for leadership and was content to remain as one of the group. Her twin was calm and completely unflappable and could almost be mistaken for kind; if he weren't so deadly with a dagger, that is. He was loyal only to his sister and The Mist in that order.
	</p><p>The Draik looked to the stealthy Hissi curled up next to her. His sky-blue eyes looked steadily back, memories reflected there. He was the only one that knew her from her past, before she had ever been a bandit leader. Even if he weren't mute, he would never share the secrets he held. She wouldn't be where she was right now without him.  
Like a serving of sweet sticky rice with a dash of ginger on top to give it some spice, this bunch of bandits, with all of their good and bad qualities made up The Mist.

<h2>September 2023</h2>
<p>Fellow and I were sitting on the couch. 
	</p><p>."We've known each other for almost two decades now," I said to him. 
	</p><p>We had met when I was eight and he was fifteen. 
	</p><p>."My brothers and I didn't know what to make of the wee American lass with the wild golden hair and bold brown eyes," Fellow responded in his rich Scottish brogue. 
	</p><p>."We've been through a lot together, haven't we?"
	</p><p>."Aye, that we have."
	</p><p>We had been acquaintances for a year before Fellow finally moved into our little community. He, along with his two brothers, became a fixture in my life. As he became an adult, he married a dear friend of mine but then she passed of a chronic illness. Broken by the experience, that is where our bond truly formed. We shared the same values and ideals, knew each other inside and out and probably better than anyone else. It was joked by our friends that we could communicate without words and knew what the other would say before we said it. Though, it was <i>not</i> romantic, contrary to everyone that saw us together guessed. 
	</p><p>We were simply two individuals brought together by life that had chosen to stick it out. We had seen each other through many different bumps in the road, including the loss of more friends, family, a move across the country, raising countless youngsters that found themselves with no place to go or family to speak of, until they somehow found their way to our door. 
	</p><p>This was a rare quiet moment, much as we enjoyed it, our lives were filled with <i>too much</i> to ever be anything less than busy. But we had worked hard for this house, this land, and the environment we cultivated within its walls. It was a refuge, a safe place for those that chose to call it home. We worked together to keep everyone safe and welcome.  
	</p><p>I was proud of what we had accomplished here. It meant everything to me, but I knew that I wouldn't have been able to do any of it without the one sitting next to me. 
	</p><p>."I don't know what I'd do without you, Fellow," I said softly, my heart breaking at the very thought. 
	</p><p>He shifted to face me, brown eyes serious. "I'm here, lass and I'm not going anywhere."
	</p><p>This year in particular had been one of the roughest we had ever experienced. It seemed like we'd taken one hard hit after another, facing chronic illness, loss of loved ones and other stressors that-taken separately-were doable but altogether were almost too much to bear. 
	</p><p>This individual I'd called Fellow almost from the moment we'd met (though that wasn't his real name) had helped me through each of them. I'd cried as he held me and cried <i>with</i> me. We buoyed each other through life's toughest moments and while we were so often broken by them, we helped piece each other back together. We chose to keep going, together.

<h2>August 2023</h2>
<p><i>Lights will guide you home…</i>
	</p><p>Luomiere was at a music festival on Roo Island. While he was not musically inclined himself, he did enjoy listening to music of just about every genre so he made sure to attend the music festival every year. The energy was electric, with so many music lovers concentrated in the same place. It was always a great time, hanging with friends and listening to some jammin' music. He always came away with the greatest memories and some new music to add to his favourites. 
	</p><p>."Have you seen my grandson?" 
	</p><p>Luomiere turned to see a middle-aged Ixi showing his phone to fellow festival goers, his red eyes dark with concern. Those that he showed the picture to shook their heads and the Ixi moved on. 
	</p><p>Luomiere felt a tug to help. This happened to him often. The wayward and the lost seemed to find him and he in turn helped them find their way. The festival would last all weekend. He could take time out to help this Ixi. 
	</p><p>The glowing Buzz zipped expertly through the crowd and stopped in front of the Ixi. "You're looking for your grandson?"
	</p><p>."Yes, his name is Asher. He's eleven years old. Have you seen him?" The Ixi flipped his phone for Luomiere to see a picture of a gangly young fire Ixi. 
	</p><p>."No, I haven't but I can help you look."
	</p><p>."That would be wonderful."
	</p><p>."Is it just the two of you here at the festival?"
	</p><p>The Ixi nodded. "Yes, we wanted to try something new and decided that a music festival would be fun. Asher was so excited to see his favourite bands live. He's never been to a concert before."
	</p><p>."I bet. A festival is exciting, even for adults! Have you alerted security?"
	</p><p>The Ixi shook his head. "I wanted to try looking for him on my own first. Its only been half an hour since I lost track of him. I told him not to go too far from me."
	</p><p>."I'm sure Asher is fine. The festival is a big one but this is Roo Island. There isn't much to worry about here," Luomiere reassured. He looked thoughtful for a moment. "What are Asher's favourite bands?"
	</p><p>. "His favourite is Moehawk."
	</p><p>."And where did you last see him?"
	</p><p>."Near the Jazzmosis stage."
	</p><p>Luomiere looked at his shoulder, where his green Carmariller perched. "Glo, can you do an aerial search? I'll help from the ground but I'll need your perspective."
	</p><p>Glo chirped and immediately launched into the air.  She fluttered away, flying low over the crowd.
	</p><p>Luomiere had the Ixi named Magnus send a pic of Asher to his phone and then they split up, methodically working their way through the crowd. They slowly headed in the direction of the Moehawk stage. Twenty minutes later they arrived but to their dismay, they couldn't spot the young fire Ixi anywhere in the crowd and nobody nearby had seen him either. 
	</p><p>."I don't understand," Magnus said. "I thought for sure he would be here. Moehawk was the band he most wanted to see."
	</p><p>."I wouldn't panic just yet. Kids get distracted easily and there's a lot going on here," Luomiere reassured. Though, even he was beginning to wonder where this kid was. 
	</p><p>That's when he heard the alert whistle of his Carmariller. She flew up in a spiral, a small glowing light in the gathering summer dusk. She was clear across the festival grounds.
	</p><p>."Glo's found him!" Luomiere exclaimed, waving Magnus onward_  
	</p><p>The camouflage Ixi and glowing Buzz wove their way through the crowds as best they could. It took several minutes before they finally reached where Glo hovered just above the crowd, directly over a young, gangly fire Ixi. 
	</p><p>."Asher!" Magnus exclaimed, rushing forward to hug the younger Ixi. 
	</p><p>Asher let out an indignant squeak. "Grampa! I'm not a baby anymore."
	</p><p>."No but you're still my responsibility, you know," Magnus explained, letting his grandson breathe. "I was so worried because I didn't know where you were or whether something might have happened to you."
	</p><p>Luomiere reached out a hand for Glo to perch on. "Well done," he praised her softly. His eyes took in the crowd and was rather taken aback to see that they were surrounded by pirates. 
	</p><p>."What are you doing over here?" Magnus asked Asher. 
	</p><p>."I was looking for Moehawk but I came across this band made entirely out of pirates. Isn't that cool?" Asher exclaimed, with a little bounce of excitement. 
	</p><p>."Oh, that's right!" Luomiere exclaimed as something clicked. "The Mellow Marauders, they're called."
	</p><p>The music festival was arranged alphabetically so it was no wonder that on his way to see Moehawk, Asher had come across the Mellow Marauders first. What kid could resist pirates?
	</p><p>Magnus turned to Luomiere. "Thank you for helping me find my grandson."
	</p><p>."You're welcome. I'm always happy to help," Luomiere responded at once. 
	</p><p>The glowing Buzz left the reunited Ixi, pleased that he had been able to be a guiding light once again.

	<p>She watched. 
	</p><p>The Minitheus is a large, powerfully built Petpet. Most were intimidated by their sheer size and reputation though they were not usually aggressive unless provoked. Native to Altador, they were a common sight in that city guarding important places or objects. As a result, they became a symbol of nobility and loyalty. So, it was no wonder that King Altador, upon his city's return to modern Neopia, gifted one to Faerie Queen Fyora. 
	</p><p>She watched. 
	</p><p>The faerie Minitheus was the smallest of the species though still easily towered over even the tallest 'pets and faeries. Yet, she was also gentle and mild-mannered. She took readily to the queen's gardens where she could enjoy the feel of grass beneath her hooves and the sweet scents of flowers. It was a peaceful, quiet place perfectly suited for her kind nature. Faeries and other guests frequented the gardens, many unaware of her presence. 
	</p><p>She watched. 
	</p><p>Until one day this peaceful refuge was broken by the cry of an infant. The Minitheus followed the sound to find a fussy baby Gnorbu, her mother trying and failing to appease her. Drawn forward by the infant's distress, the Minitheus didn't budge, merely blew a breath of sweet-scented air in the direction of the infant. When the mother looked up, the Minitheus held her place, head lowered, and soft brown eyes fixed on the baby the mother held. To the mother's great surprise, the baby looked back with a laugh of delight and reaching hands. 
	</p><p>She watched.  
	</p><p>The world changed yet again this time from faerie garden to snowy mountain. An earth faerie briefly came to stay to train her how to live in a land of snow and ice where her gifts for growing flowers wherever she stepped was a huge problem. A greenhouse was built to accommodate her magical abilities. Soon, the flowers within that lovely little greenhouse bloomed, a shelter from the overwhelming whiteness of the world beyond it. 
	</p><p>She watched. 
</p><p>The infant grew to a toddler. One that loved to toddle about with wide green eyes and a smiling face. She loved hugs and stories and watching falling snow. She loved soft blankets, borovan and using her Minitheus as a giant bed. She delighted in the flowers her Minitheus grew and the Minitheus delighted in her just the same. 
</p><p>She watched. 
</p><p>The toddler become a child. One that liked to sing and dance. That loved pretty things. One that was generous and thoughtful. That learned to braid her Minitheus' mane and weave flowers into her own braid so that she and her Minitheus matched. 
</p><p>She watched. 
</p><p> The child become a teenager. One that began to learn more about the world that she lived in and how she would become a part of it. One that knew her own mind but learned to be gracious in the face of adversity. One that saw goodness wherever she went, not realizing that she often was the goodness. One that was compassionate and sensitive and not afraid to show it. 
</p><p>She watched. 
</p><p>The teenager become a young adult. One that had grown to be gentle and kind and beautiful. One that met another young Gnorbu with the same sweet spirit. The new young couple decided to start a family of their own. First, they welcomed one infant into the world, one with his mother's eyes but his father's colouring. Then another just like the first (but a little girl, this time).

<h2>April 2023</h2>
<p>."Its good to see you!"
</p><p>The two older teens hugged, reuniting after being apart for months.
</p><p>."How have you been, Tor?" Vic asked, black eyes assessing his friend with ease.
</p><p>Tor, ever reserved, merely nodded his head. He did not readily show emotion but his longtime friends could read him easily enough. "Fine."
</p><p>."Yeah, I missed you, too!" Vic agreed. Then, he gave a light laugh. "Have you gotten even taller since we last met?"
</p><p>Tor's lips twitched, though they didn't know whether to smile or frown so in fact did neither.
</p><p>Height ran in Tor's family but whereas his siblings were all tall and broad, the ice elemental was tall and lean. It wasn't something he could help, that he towered over his much smaller, stockier friends. Yet, they constantly marveled at him. The attention had definitely made him uncomfortable but he had gotten used to it, with time.
</p><p>."I told the girls to meet us in the plaza," Tor said.
</p><p>Vic nodded, used to Tor deflecting when things got too much for him to handle.
</p><p>The two of them chatted comfortably with each other as only old friends could. They strolled side by side, making quite an unusual picture. Vic, short and slim with dark eyes and hair, covered head to toe in a cloak that made sure not a speck of skin could be touched by the sun. Tor, tall and lean, all angles and edges, with white hair and pale blue eyes.
</p><p>Suddenly, a cry tore through the air.
</p><p>."That sounded like the girls!" Vic exclaimed.
</p><p>The two young men broke into a run. It had been a year since Tor had been in the village and while his memory was starting to fade, they were still fresh enough to help him now. He slipped through the narrow streets, Vic right on his heels. As they neared the plaza, Tor turned one last corner to see Divine and Jade squaring off against a couple of men twice their size. One of them had Divine by the arm and her face
twisted with disgust. Suddenly, the man cried out, staggering back as his palm sizzled with heat.
</p><p>."You're in for it now!" the other man growled.
</p><p>Before he could touch either girl, Tor extended a hand to throw up a thin sheet of ice, blocking the alley just enough to separate the young elementals from their attackers. The two men started crying for help and cries of alarm broke through the village. The rush of others coming to the rescue against the vile elementals would arrive shortly.
</p><p>."That ice isn't going to hold for long," Tor warned. He looked at Vic. "You're the only that can get out of here."
</p><p>."I can't leave you!" Vic protested,
</p><p>."You have to!" Jade gave the older boy a steady look. "No sense in having all four of us here if one of us has the chance to get away."
</p><p>."But I can help! It doesn't have to end like this!"
</p><p>."Vic!" Tor grabbed his friend by the wrist. Their gazes locked. "Go!" With a light shove, he pushed his first ever friend into the nearest shadow.
</p><p>Vic disappeared into the shadow without leaving a trace. Just as the ice wall broke and a crowd of angry villagers surrounded the three remaining elementals.
</p><p>Divine and Jade pressed in on either side of Tor. For once, Tor didn't flinch from Divine's inner fire. It was against the law for elementals to attack non-elementals. They had no choice but to surrender. They were in a deep mess and he had no idea how they were going to get out of it. He could only comfort himself with the fact that they were together.
Whatever happened next, they'd get through it together.

<h2>March 2023</h2>
<p>	Having newly arrived from Faerieland to Kreludor, Indigo was learning all sorts of new things about Neopia. Things like seasons and seasonal activities. Things like weather and nature. Very different from Kreludor! Strange as it all was, she was glad she had come. 
</p><p>	Especially because she had quickly made friends who were eager to help her transition. This time, she was in the marketplace with a faerie friend. The marketplace was full of strange food called vegetables. Her friends had already explained that autumn-the season they were in right now-was also harvest time. All the food the farmers had worked to grow from spring and summer were now ready to harvest. 
</p><p>	It was a time of celebration throughout Neopia. Even though faeries didn't farm, they still celebrated the season with harvest parties and other such activities. In fact, Indigo was invited to her very first one soon. She was looking forward to it and eager to try out the recipe she had learned for the occasion. For now, however, she was enjoying looking through the crowded marketplace and taking in everything it had to offer. 
</p><p>	So, it was that she found herself in front of a market stall labeled "Pumpkins". It was the only sign yet the so-called pumpkins were all shapes, sizes and colours. 
</p><p>.	"These are all pumpkins?" Indigo asked. She guessed they were like flowers in that regard with the same name but different appearances (or like Neopets for that matter). 
</p><p>.	"Yup, they sure are!" the shopkeep confirmed. 
</p><p>.	"And are they for food or decoration?"
</p><p>.	"Both. There's lots of pumpkin recipes but they're also used for decorations. Just like this but sometimes carved or even painted."
</p><p>	Indigo considered this for a moment. "Do you have any recipes you could recommend?"
</p><p>.	"Sure!" The shopkeep pulled out a small booklet. "There's several in here that you can try."
</p><p>.	"Thank you!"
</p><p>.	"Does this mean you'd like to buy a pumpkin?"
</p><p>.	"I'd like to give it a try."
</p><p>.	"Any that catches your eye?"
</p><p>	Indigo was about to shake her head when her eyes caught on a dark blue, almost black pumpkin, close to her own skin colour. "I'll take that one!"
</p><p>.	"Interesting choice but too small to eat," the shopkeeper pointed out as she plucked the palm-sized pumpkin from the pile. 
</p><p>.	"I'm not going to eat this one. I want to keep it for decoration."
</p><p>.	"Alright, so you set with the one or do you still want to take another to try some recipes?"
</p><p>.	"I'd still like to try some recipes so I guess I'll take two."
</p><p>	The shopkeeper plucked up a mid-sized, bright orange pumpkin from the pile for Indigo.
</p><p>	Now with her purchases in tow, she headed home. She put the orange pumpkin in the kitchen but the black pumpkin she placed on her nightstand. It was the last thing she saw before falling asleep. 
</p><p>	When the faerie Grundo blinked her eyes open the next morning, the pumpkin blinked back. She sat up with a gasp. Seemingly overnight, the pumpkin had gained three crescent eyes and a gap-toothed mouth. "The shopkeeper didn't say anything about this!" she marveled. "Well, new friend, let's start the day."
</p><p>	Indigo returned to the pumpkin stall to share this discovery. "You never mentioned that the pumpkins carve themselves!"
</p><p>.	"Carve them-whoa!" the faerie's eyes widened in alarm as the black pumpkin grinned up at her. "That is not a pumpkin. What you have there is, I think, a mutant Clompkin, a Haunted Woods Petpet," the faerie clarified at seeing Indigo's confused look. 
</p><p>.	"A Haunted Woods Petpet!" Indigo exclaimed. "Well, how did he get here?"
</p><p>.	"Its no secret that the Haunted Woods grows the best pumpkins. They sell them wholesale to other regions and this one must have been accidently sent with the last shipment."
</p><p>.	"What do you say, little guy? Would you like to stay with me?" Indigo asked the Petpet. 
</p><p>	His grin didn't waver and Indigo took that as a positive response. She hugged him close. "Its great to have a new friend!"
</p><p>	Indigo named her new Petpet Night, for he was the colour of the night sky and he had sprouted overnight. With time, he grew to have a thick black trunk and roots to help him move. He absorbed nutrients from the earth like any plant did but could grow and shrink at will. His preferred size was close to Indigo's own, if a little shorter though he could also tower to twice her height if he so chose. No matter his size, she was thankful for the friendship that had sprouted between them.

<h2>February 2023</h2>
<p>Two identical faces stood side by side staring into the bathroom mirror. So close were they that they could be mistaken for twins and often were. The problem was they
weren't twins. Maya was <i>Sky's</i> twin, not Teal's. Teal was a whole year older than the twins but there was no denying that he and Maya looked far more alike than Sky and Maya, especially because Maya favoured a shorter hairdo that made her look boyish.
</p><p>Sky had been passing by and happened to see her siblings in the bathroom and it suddenly felt like she had lost her twin. Her heart twisted painfully and she suddenly
felt short of breath, tears springing to her eyes. She ran away, unable to bear looking at the scene before her any longer. Blinded by unhappiness, she ran smack dab into
someone else.
</p><p>."What are you crying for?"
</p><p>The harsh question succeeded in shaking Sky out of her tears. She looked up into the dark features of her older brother, Cobalt. Not naturally sympathetic, he glared
down at her, taking in her tear streaked face without a flicker of compassion.
</p><p>Sky rubbed her face with one small fist and sniffed. "Maya's not my twin anymore."
</p><p>Cobalt snorted in disbelief. "What are you talking about?"
</p><p>."She and Teal look more alike than me and her do," Sky said sadly, looking down at her feet. Just saying the words aloud made her throat tighten and the tears begin to
fall once more.
</p><p>Cobalt heaved a sigh and crouched down to be on her eye level. He shoved a handkerchief at her. "Here. Stop crying. Maya is still your twin. She will <i>always</i> be your twin. Doesn't matter whether the two of you look alike or not."
</p><p>Sky scrubbed at her face with the handkerchief, voice muffled by the cloth. "I know but, I know but-" She let her hands fall, handkerchief crumpled in her hand, frustrated. "She spends more time with Teal than me even though she's <i>my</i> twin and not his!"
</p><p>."Sky, listen to me," Cobalt said firmly, grasping his baby sister's shoulders. "Just because you have a twin doesn't mean the two of you have to look alike or do
everything together. You are both your own person. You have your own talents and interests and they don't always have to involve your twin."
</p><p>Sky furrowed her brow, clearly considering what her older brother was saying. "Like what?"
</p><p>Cobalt rolled his eyes and rose to his feet, tired of crouching. "I don't know, Sky. Like…" He paused for a moment to think. "Like you wanna be a pilot when you get big,
yeah? So, you like learning about flying. You can name every airplane make and model and know all about their speed and what each type is best used for. Nobody else can say that and you're only five!"
</p><p>."Yeah, that's right!" Sky exclaimed, suddenly brightening. "I do know lots about planes and flying. I never thought about that before." She suddenly hugged her brother and before he could shove her off, reached up to peck him on the cheek. "Thanks, Cobalt!"
</p><p>The little girl skipped down the hall, sadness forgotten, leaving her brother staring after her, his own mood briefly lifted for the encounter.

<blockquote>
<h2>January 2023</h2>
<p>Cobalt scrambled up the tree. It was a familiar perch to him, he who spent the majority of his time out of doors and in the woodland surrounding his small hometown. Much better than spending time with people, especially his family. His reclusive nature had only intensified after the passing of his father the previous summer. Ironically, he was climbing the tree for his family now. 
</p><p>	The soft buzzing of Combee alerted him that he was drawing close to his goal. He clambered up a bit more, the Combee beginning to realize that he was drawing closer to their hive than he had ever dared before. Not wanting to aggravate them, he stopped on a sturdy branch and looked at the small swarm that buzzed around him. 
</p><p>.	"My mom's birthday is coming up. The first one without Dad and I know its gonna be hard on her. Birthdays are a big deal in my family and so there's no skipping it. All of my siblings are so creative and making her something personal." Cobalt sighed with a shake of his head. "I'm nothing like that. I don't like art or acting or cooking. I'm not inventive or crafty. But that doesn't mean I can't try. I've been wracking my brain for the past couple months and now I have an idea, but I need honey to do it." Cobalt looked at the Combee. He had their full attention. "I'm not going to take a lot and I'm not going to take it if you're unwilling to give it so I'm asking now.".
</p><p>	The Combee buzzed gently around him and one of them flew up to the hive nestled in the tree's upper branches. He returned with a chunk of honeycomb. 
</p><p>	Cobalt breathed a sigh of relief, the hint of a smile twitching his lips. "Thank you.".
</p><p>	The boy quicky wrapped the honeycomb in a container he'd brought from home and made his way safely to the ground. The honeycomb could be a gift in and of itself, but he also knew that it could be used to make all sorts of things from soap to candles to lip balm. His older sister, Cerulean, had started learning how to make a lot of things that they would otherwise have to buy, doing her best to make everything last now that there were six kids to feed on only half the income they'd had before Dad died. So, Cobalt was gonna try his hand at it. His mom was great and worked hard to take care of everybody, even at the expense of herself. 
</p><p>	His mom deserved only the best. 
	</p><p>Cobalt returned home and entered the kitchen, gathering the supplies and ingredients he'd need. Having assisted Ru more than once, he could handle himself and remembered all the steps necessary to create his gift. Giving it some though, he decided to make some honey lotion bars. They were simple enough to make and he was pleased with how they came out. He hoped Mom would feel the same. 
</p><p>~ ~ ~ 
	</p><p>."You kept this?" Cobalt was visiting his mom and gone into her bathroom to fetch something. To his surprise, he had seen a small round cake of lotion, recognizable by its rather haphazard shape and unusually dark colouring. It wasn't the prettiest in colour or smell. Seeing it again after a couple decades brought Cobalt right back to the little lost boy he had been. 
	</p><p>His mom smiled, eyes crinkled now with age but still beautiful. "Of course, I did. I've kept all the gifts my children have given me over the years. You made it for me and I'll always cherish it.".

<h2>December 2022</h2>
<p>The old Krawk closed his journal, standing quietly for a moment with one hand on the cover. After a short sigh, he went about his nightly routine. It wasn't much, mostly changing out of his day clothes and into his pajamas. Soon finished, he pulled back the covers and settled into bed. The last thing he did was click off the light before falling asleep. 

</p><p><i>	He opened his eyes to the sights and sounds of a jungle, something he hadn't experienced since his youth in Tyrannia. In fact, this</i> was <i>the Tyrannian jungle. He recognized the trees and hanging vines. The chattering of the Petpets as they moved through the canopy. Even the humidity was familiar as it pressed around him, warming his scales. 
	</i></p><p><i>Then, he cocked his head as a new sound caught his attention. It was the gurgle of water! He took a few steps forward to find a river flowing past. Now</i> this <i>was unexpected. There had never been a river in the jungle before, at least not during his lifetime. 
	</i></p><p><i>He had often dreamed of his childhood home but never like this. New details were never added and he wondered if this were not…something else. For the moment, he was more curious than alarmed. 
	</i></p><p><i>He drew closer to the river. As his eyes fell to the water, he found himself shocked by his reflection. For he looked as he had in his youth: vibrant scales, thick spikes, clear eyes. Reluctantly pulling his eyes away, he sensed that there was more to see though he only half-guessed at what it might be. He was drawn on by a deep yearning he had long denied. Around the next bend of the river, he found it. 
	</i></p><p><i>Emerald River. 
	</i></p><p><i>But he had never seen it like this. The castle stood tall and proud on the riverbank. Gone were the crumbling walls and vine covered stonework. It was no longer overrun by the jungle. There were no signs of neglect or disrepair to be found. Rather, it appeared that the jungle kept a respectable distance, as if in awe of the castle's quiet fortitude. 
	</i></p><p><i>Then, a silhouette caught his eye. A sight he had ached to see. A camouflage Eyrie circled the far tower and flew towards him. Like him, gone were any signs of age. In a moment, the two of them embraced like only old friends could. 
	</i></p><p><i>."What? How?"
	</i></p><p><i>."Have you not figured it out yet?"
	</i></p><p><i>Janga gave his lifelong friend a puzzled look. She was acting completely nonplussed by the whole situation. "No, not really."
	</i></p><p><i>Jade laughed. "Come on. There's someone else that's been waiting to see you again. Or make that two someones."
	</i></p><p><i>The Eyrie pulled the Krawk along toward the castle entrance. There, he saw two figures that he hadn't seen since his youth: a silver Krawk and an eventide Krawk. 
	</i></p><p><i>."My parents," Janga breathed, feeling the tears spring to his eyes. He raced forward to embrace them, feeling their love wrap around him as he had never felt in life. 
	</i></p><p><i>."Welcome home, Janga. Welcome home.".</i>

<h2>November 2022</h2>
<p><i>Jade saved my life today. 
</i></p><p><i>I was standing out on the platform, lost in thought and grief when an earthquake struck. The stone beneath my feet crumbled and I would have fallen to my death if Jade had not come out of nowhere to catch me. We fluttered above the castle as the earth shuddered. We could only watch as portions of the castle collapsed. The entrance to the castle fell in on itself. The northeast tower where the Aviary was located fell into the central courtyard. Even the roof of the Observatory was partially destroyed. 
</i></p><p><i>Then, the earthquake stopped. 
	</i></p><p><i>We landed gingerly on the open deck of the Observatory, mindful that it may not support our weight. After a tense moment, we relaxed and I looked at my childhood friend. 
	</i></p><p><i>."Thank you," I said, encompassing all of my gratitude in those two simple words. 
	</i></p><p><i>Jade understood for she dipped her head in response. "I'm so glad I made it in time.".
	</i></p><p><i>."What are you doing here?".
	</i></p><p><i>."Saving your life," Jade teased. 
	</i></p><p><i>Despite watching the destruction of the only home I had ever known, I couldn't help the smile I gave my oldest friend as she made light of the situation. Not that I was surprised. Jade had a way of making even the worst things better. 
	</i></p><p><i>."Well, besides that. What brings you back here?" I asked. 
	</i></p><p><i>At once, Jade grew serious. "My father became concerned when communication from Emerald River abruptly stopped. He couldn't come himself, of course, so I volunteered to come in his stead.".
	</i></p><p><i>My throat tightened as the reason for that came to the fore. "My father died three months ago.".
	</i></p><p><i>Immediately, Jade's eyes filled with sadness and she swept me into a hug. "Oh, Janga! I'm so sorry!" She pulled back to look at me. "And you've been alone all this time?".
	</i></p><p><i>I nodded. "Other than The Snapper of course and the Aviary Petpets but I rehomed most of those and released the rest. Thankfully…" I trailed off, thinking of how their former home had been destroyed. 
	</i></p><p><i>."If you've been alone for that long, why did you stay?".
	</i></p><p><i>."Where would I go? Emerald River is-</i>was <i>my home." While I should have been grieved over its destruction, I felt relieved. 
	</i></p><p><i>The truth is that Emerald River had been on a slow decline for longer than I had been alive. My parents had clung on to its once prosperous roots in vain. In the end, there was no saving it. The earthquake had seen to that. I was now free of the burden of trying to save it. 
	</i></p><p><i>But what was I going to do with my freedom?
	</i></p><p><i>."To Altador, duh!" Jade answered, as if it were obvious. 
	</i></p><p><i>."And do what?" I asked. 
	</i></p><p><i>."Hang out with your best friend. And we can figure out the rest later.".
	</i></p><p><i>."Alright, let's go to Altador.".</i>

	</p><p>This was the last journal entry. 
	</p><p>."Wait, that's it?" Somarrah asked though she knew it was. 
	</p><p>She was glad she had read the journals. She had gotten many answers but finished with even more questions. Why Janga had stopped writing was obvious. But why had he left the journals here? What had happened to him after he left Tyrannia?
</p><p>	There was only one way for Somarrah to find out. 
</p><p>She looked at Rune. "I know where I have to go for college now. It really seems like the best fit for me.".
</p><p>Rune could not only understand Tyrannian and Common but read them, too. He was the closest friend she had in Tyrannia. He was the only one who knew about the Ruins besides Somarrah. 
</p><p>."I'm going to be leaving Tyrannia soon. Not just for a little while but for years while I learn best how to help this place. I was wondering if you'd be willing to come with me," Somarrah said. 
</p><p>Rune looked at her for a long moment. 
</p><p>Somarrah held her breath. She knew he cared about the ruins as much, if not more, than she did. He had been born and raised there. He had been the one to guide her as she learned about the ancient kingdom known as Emerald River. Would he be willing to leave it all behind for her?
</p><p>Rune gave a short whistle and then nodded. 
</p><p>Somarrah felt a rush of relief. Leaving Tyrannia would be hard enough. At least she would have a friend with her. "Thank you, Rune!".

<h2>October 2022</h2>
<p>Autumn had come to Neopia. 
	</p><p>Indigo had newly arrived from Kreludor. She'd always been curious about Neopia and now that she was an adult, she wanted to see what it was really like. She had decided on Faerieland as a good place to start, given that she was a faerie herself. She wanted to learn as much as she could about Neopian traditions. They were nothing like Kreludor! 
</p><p>	An air faerie that she had met and befriended arrived on her doorstep with an invitation. "I'm inviting you to my harvest party coming up soon."
</p><p>.	"Oh, I love parties! But what are you harvesting?" Indigo asked, confused. 
</p><p>.	"Its harvest season here in Neopia. All the hard work farmers have put into their crops are finally going to pay off so its time to celebrate."
</p><p>.	"But you're not a farmer?"
</p><p>.	The air faerie laughed. "No, but we can still throw a harvest party. Its what Neopians do during autumn."
</p><p><i>Right.</i> Space didn't have seasons but Neopia did. Apparently, they had <i>seasonal</i> traditions that you only did during the relevant <i>season.</i> 
</p><p>.	"OK, I'll be there!" Indigo accepted with a broad smile.
 </p><p>."Great! It's a potluck so you can bring something to eat or drink for everyone to enjoy but don't feel obligated. I know you're a newcomer, not just to Faerieland but to Neopia as a whole. It'll be enough for me if you come!"
</p><p>.	"Of course I'll bring something for the party."
</p><p>.	"See you!"
</p><p>	As the air faerie left, Indigo did too. She knew a little Kreludor cuisine but of course none of it was seasonal. She wanted to bring something that would suit a harvest party and the season. She headed for the marketplace, mind racing to figure out what would be appropriate. She hadn't gotten far when she saw a flashy poster in a confectionary shop win.dow. 
</p><p>	A beige orb sprinkled in some sort of chip gleamed on the bright green poster. THE SEASON'S SWEETEST TREAT! it boldly proclaimed. 
</p><p>.	"That's it!" Indigo exclaimed, rushing into the shop to find out more. 
</p><p>	An earth faerie stood at the counter and smiled warmly at her as she approached. 
</p><p>.	"Excuse me, I'm new to the area and was invited to something called a harvest party and wanted to take something nice but didn't know what. Then I saw your poster outside that says it's the season's sweetest treat. Could you tell me what it is and how to make it, please?" Indigo gushed, sky blue eyes looking earnestly up at the much taller faerie standing across from her. 
</p><p>.	"Well, its simple enough and I suppose I could give you the ingredients and the directions. But if you can't figure it out, you can always come back here and I'll be happy to make them for your party," the earth faerie said. "In fact, here," the faerie continued, slipping over a square block of…something towards her. "The other ingredient you'll have to buy from the marketplace but take this caramel. It's the best in Neopia," she said with a wink.
</p><p>.	"Thank you!"
</p><p>	The earth faerie scribbled the information on a piece of paper and handed it over to Indigo. "Good luck!"
</p><p>	 Indigo smiled her thanks before leaving. She headed for the market to get the remaining ingredients. There were only three and one of them was optional. She had the caramel now all she needed were-
</p><p>.	"There!" 
</p><p>	The faerie Grundo rushed over to where the gleaming red and green orbs sat in a basket in the market. They were surrounded by other foods of various sizes, shapes and colours, none of which the foreign faerie recognized. The paper said that red or green could be used and it didn't matter which. To be on the safe side, Indigo opted for both. She grabbed a bagful before heading home, full of excitement for the coming party! 
</p><p>	At last, the day arrived. 
</p><p>	Indigo pulled out the ingredients and prepared them as the paper instructed. It seemed easy enough and everything went smoothly as far as she could tell. Only a little while longer before the harvest party was set to begin! 
</p><p>	She couldn't wait to share her caramel treat with everyone!
</p><p>	Indigo headed to the party with her treats safely nestled in a carrying case. She headed straight for the food tables set up outside, for not only more room but also to enjoy the beauty of the autumn colours and the crispness of the day. She set down her tray of caramel treats, immediately drawing those nearby. 
</p><p>.	"Oh, yum! Caramel apples!"
</p><p>.	"Those look so good!"
</p><p>.	"I can't wait to try them!"
</p><p>.	"Indigo, did you make them yourself?"
</p><p>.	"Yes, I did," Indigo said with her characteristic big smile. "They were even easier to make than I thought. I hope everyone enjoys them."
</p><p>	As the faerie Grundo stepped back, the others began to help themselves. Eagerly, they bit down into the crunchy caramel orbs. Each only got a bite in before their faces twisted with disgust. They spat out the caramel apples, retching and coughing. Many grabbed the nearest drink to guzzle. 
</p><p>.	"Indigo, what did you do?"
</p><p>	Indigo looked at her new friends in confusion. "I made caramel apples like the instructions said. I don't understand. They came out just like the poster I saw."
</p><p>.	"Those weren't apples you used, Indigo," her air faerie friend corrected gently. 
</p><p>.	"Those were onions_ " a dark faerie snapped. 
</p><p>.	"Oh!" Indigo exclaimed, uncertain of what the difference was. "I'm sorry. I'll be sure not to make that mistake again."
</p><p>	She had so much to learn!

<h2>September 2022
</h2><p>Slate walked down the familiar streets and slipped into the theater; the majority of his childhood memories had been formed here. Too bad he was no longer a child. As of
that morning, he was officially an adult. Of course, he had been an adult for the last five months. As such, he now had to let go of childish things.
</p><p>No matter how much it broke him.
</p><p>He entered the director's office, a place he had visited many times over the years. It was a welcoming place, a comfy place, a place one could feel at home in. It wasn't so much the big windows, colourful art, or family pictures. Nor was it the bowl of sweets on the desk, the plush chairs or the various theater knickknacks. It was the man sitting behind the desk that did that.
</p><p>Meredith "Merry" De Witt was a tall man with wavy, sandy-brown hair, blue eyes and broad shoulders. He was always ready with a smile with laugh lines at his mouth and eyes. With his high cheek bones and strong jaw, he had a distinctive look. The type to make a person feel at ease; once you met him, you didn't forget him.
</p><p>Merry's eyes lit up as he saw Slate and waved his hand at the seat across from him. "Happy eighteenth birthday, Slate!"
</p><p>."Thank you, Merry," Slate said. Though he smiled, it was only half-hearted.
</p><p>."You know Fi and I would have loved taking you to lunch but you said you have something to tell me."
</p><p>Slate took a deep breath and nodded. "I'm quitting theater."
</p><p>Merry's expressive face showed all too easily his shock at this announcement.
</p><p>He rocked back for a moment but recovered his composure well. "That is the last thing I ever thought I'd hear you say." His brow furrowed. "May I ask why?"
</p><p>."Losing my dad last summer was rough for my entire family," Slate began, voice breaking. He took a moment to compose himself. "My family has barely scra.ped by the
last five months. My mother doesn't make enough to support seven children. She needs help and-as the oldest-it's up to me to help her. I can't work a full time job, go to school
and do theater. So, I have to choose."
</p><p>."I understand how hard this must be."
</p><p>."I knew I had to tell you so that you could find a replacement for my parts in the spring production as well as for the summer tour."
</p><p>."No one can replace you, Slate Blythe," Merry said. "I would offer you a job working here but-" he spread his hands in a helpless gesture.
</p><p>."But this is a community theater, not Broadway. What little money we do have has already been spent."
</p><p>."So, what do you plan to do?"
</p><p>."When school starts back up again, I'll be applying for EMT training. It takes only two weeks to be certified and pays decent. I'll complete my senior year by
homeschooling and as soon as I get my diploma, I'll start as an EMT. Once my two week training is over, I'll find some job or other to help make ends meet until then."
</p><p>."You've thought a lot about this."
</p><p>Slate nodded. "Yeah."
</p><p>."I wish you all the best, Slate." Merry stood up and the two men embraced.
</p><p>."Thanks, Merry. For everything," Slate said before pulling away. 
</p><p>He left the director's office for the last time, shutting the door firmly on his childhood without a
backward glance.

<h2>August 2022</h2>
<p>Jade stood at the entrance to NETS, green eyes apprehensive. It had been a rough couple month at home and now she was finally here. It was the last thing she wanted. Yet, she had nowhere else to go. Every elemental had to come here for training (hence National Elemental Training School became NETS).
</p><p>It had been especially tough because she had been ostracized from her family, where they had been a close-knit family before. Literally overnight, that all changed and she found herself an outcast because of her oom. She looked down at her new companion: small, round, brown with beady eyes and long claws. His appearance at the
foot of her sleeping mat had changed her life for the worse. Yet, there was no getting rid of him.
</p><p>Every terran mage had an oom.
</p><p>Apparently, that included her.
</p><p>Of course, she wasn't the only one who had lost everything when they turned thirteen and their elemental powers suddenly showed up. Mages were a minority in the country and looked down upon. Generally seen as bad luck, unpredictable and
therefore dangerous, they were shunned from common society.
</p><p>Except here.
</p><p>Jade joined the stream of other elementals in training as they crossed the land bridge that would bring them to their new home during the school year. She didn't make eye contact with any of them, though she did see a few other Khati she of course didn't
know their names and wasn't comfortable introducing herself to a bunch of strangers.
</p><p>."Novas, this way please for sorting and mentor pairing!" a voice called over the sea of students.
</p><p>Novas, the nickname for all first year students. That meant her! Jade scurried after the other Novas as they headed inside a tall building. Jade had never seen such a tall building before. Back on the plateau, everything was flat and the buildings were all squat and round.
</p><p>She was filed into a moderately sized room with the other Novas. They milled around uncertainly, shifty as a herd without a leader. Jade looked around, knowing her confusion was as clear to see as a temple pennant. Remarkably, she didn't stay that way for long.
</p><p>."Hey, you're Jade, right?" a girl approached, her brown eyes bold.
</p><p>."Uh, yes," Jade said with a nod.
</p><p>."Divine Daville," the girl introduced. "I'm your mentor.".
</p><p>."Oh, OK.".
</p><p>."Come on. No need to stay inside. I can barely hear myself think in here.".
</p><p>Jade stayed on the girl's heels as they left the room. Divine led Jade a little way away from the tall building.
</p><p>."Your dorm is there," Divine said, pointing towards a building directly in front of them. The squat, earthen structure was comforting in its familiarity. "All the Terrans live there. In case you can't tell, I'm an Ignis so I live in the Pit with the other fire elementals. The good news is, that our dorms are right next to each other," Divine continued, pointing to a canvas structure to the right of the Terran dorm. "Now, as your mentor, I'm here to guide you through your Nova year. So, do you have any questions for me?".
</p><p>."Oh, I have so many questions," Jade admitted.
</p><p>Divine smirked. "Then good thing I have the answers so let's get started, Nova!".
</p></blockquote>

<h2>July 2022
</h2><p>."Do you ever wish things had been different?".
</p><p>	Slate wasn't surprised by the question. It had been one he'd been asked a handful of times by family and friends alike. Though, his answer was always the same. 
</p><p>.	"I wouldn't change a thing," Slate said. 
</p><p>	He understood where the question came from. Seventeen-year-old Slate had had it all. A loving family and on the fast track to fame and fortune. Until his father had died in a mysterious accident that summer. Then, his life and that of his family, had changed forever. His mother had been unable to support a family of seven kids so-as the oldest-Slate had to put his theater dream on hold and get a job. 
</p><p>	Up until that point, he had practically lived at the theater, but it would be thirteen years before he stepped foot in one again. By then, his dream had been buried, he believed for good. His siblings were all grown and leading their own lives. They didn't need their big brother taking care of them anymore. Slate may have forgotten about the theater, but they certainly hadn't forgotten him. 
</p><p>	He was drawn back under the pretense of a New Years Eve party that was a birthday party in disguise. That may have been the end of it, but he met his future wife, Izzy, there. After that, it was all over. He reintegrated himself into the theater as if he'd never left. His fellows welcomed him as did their fans. 
</p><p>	Over time, he and Izzy took over the youth program, introducing teens to theater. It flourished under their direction. With Slate's connections in theater and beyond, he had helped start the careers of at least a dozen well-known actors: on stage, TV, and film. He and Izzy had never had children but the kids they taught were practically theirs in all but name. He couldn't be prouder of them all, no matter where their dreams took them. 
</p><p>	As for Slate?
</p><p>	His dream had long since been abandoned. He still acted locally but he had no desire to travel the nation or the world, pursuing the applause and admiration of an ever-growing audience. He loved his quiet life in the city with Izzy, their kids, and their family. A life of fame and fortune came at a heavy price. One that Slate Blythe refused to pay. 
</p><p>.	"But what about when your friend came by the other day?" the kid pressed. "Didn't some small part of you want that, too?".
</p><p>	Referencing an actor Slate had known since they were both kids in theater, his friend had moved on to star in some blockbuster hits. 
</p><p>.	"That's nice and al but not for me," Slate said. 
</p><p>."Really?" the kid sounded disbelieving. At only fourteen, of course he only saw the good side of making it big. Imagining an alternative was beyond him. 
</p><p>.	"Really." Slate nodded. "If I had to go back and do it all over again, I would. My family always comes first.".
</p><p>	The boy nodded, accepting his mentor's words, if not utterly convinced. He was young yet. He would understand someday. For now…
</p><p>.	"Enough wishful thinking. Let's run through this script again. You've almost got this part down," Slate said, refocusing his young student on the here and now rather than the what-ifs and could-have-beens.

<h2>June 2022</h2>
<p>The Rangers needed all hands on deck. It was the only reason Cobalt left the mountains he worked in northern Kanto. He met up at the HQ and greeted the Rangers he recognized. They were an elite group and-while they rarely worked together-they were a close group. They were the only people-other than his family-that he could tolerate for any length of time.
</p><p>That's when he saw a familiar redheaded woman. What was her-
</p><p>."Rocky," he said, not very loudly but enough to get her attention.
</p><p>The woman's green eyes lit up as she saw him. "That's Ranger O'Byrne to you.".
</p><p>They had met only once before a couple years prior. Rocky had been a student Ranger. As a full Ranger, Cobalt had shut down her overtly friendly nature, and ordered her to call him Ranger Blythe. Obviously, she remembered that.
</p><p>Then the woman smiled. "Just kidding. You can call me Rocky; all my friends do.".
</p><p>."That's right, I heard you graduated," Cobalt said.
</p><p>They may have said more but Ranger Silva-the man that had first introduced Cobalt to the Rangers-started the briefing. The now silver-haired man had everyone's attention and they listened as the older Ranger informed them of the situation they were going to be facing. It appeared that a rogue Pokémon was troubling the area and all efforts to capture it had failed. That's why they were all there. 
</p><p>The Rangers were split into pairs and Cobalt found himself with Rocky.
</p><p>Cobalt had become a ranger to avoid working with other people. This was a rare  moment indeed. At least a fellow ranger wasn't going to be as irritating as a civilian. Thankfully, Cobalt hadn't been immediately annoyed by Rocky the first time they'd met. Now that they were both rangers, he hoped to find an equal.
</p><p>They headed through the forest in companionable silence. They were in the thick of the trees when they first got into trouble.
</p><p>."Watch out!" Cobalt warned.
</p><p>Too late.
</p><p>Rocky blundered into an electrified net, alerting the Galvantula that had set it. Thankfully, her Monferno gave an Ember as a warning shot and the giant electric spider backed off. 
</p><p>Cobalt's jaw tightened. "You could have been electrocuted.".
</p><p>Rocky's eyes flashed and she bristled at his accusatory tone. "Galvantula aren't common in the forest where I trained or the range I work in!".
</p><p>."Well you learned it now.".
</p><p>Rocky was ready to retaliate when they were interrupted.
</p><p>."Red, Blue, they've found the rogue. You can return to base now," Silva informed them.
</p><p>Rocky turned away and sauntered off ahead of Silva.
</p><p>Silva arched a brow.
</p><p>."This is why I work alone," Cobalt said.
</p><p>."She's a fiery one but she does good work.".
</p><p>Cobalt snorted. "I'll believe that when I see it.".
</p><p>."Not everyone keeps a cool head like you do, Cobalt. That doesn't make them bad at their job.".
</p><p>Cobalt shook his head and Silva wisely let it drop. Cobalt could only hope he didn't have to work with Rocky again in the future.

<h2>May 2022</h2>
<p>I found myself in an unfamiliar forest on a beautiful day. My heart felt light as my paws across the forest floor. My ears twitched with the sounds of the forest. I was in my element when I didn't know where I was and where I was going. I could just <i>be</i>.
</p><p>That's when a voice drew my gaze upwards to the canopy. Through the dappled light falling through the leaves I could make out a bird like none I'd ever seen before.
</p><p>."Cantata, you ask for a song of my adventures. I'm no bard that can conjure songs on a whim but adventures I have plenty. I love nothing more than to explore new places and meet someone new." I smile broadly at the bird. "Like you.".
</p><p>I can tell I've captured Cantata's attention and she leans towards me but doesn't move from her perch.
</p><p>."I've made countless friends over the years and learned many a language. The things I've seen and experienced…" I shake my head as memories begin to flood me.
</p><p>Myself as a young red Wocky on my very first adventure in Neopia Central. Mundane as a cityscape is, everything was new to me and I drank it all in with wide eyed wonder.
</p><p>Now as a Christmas Wocky traveling down a country lane. I was beginning to find my place in the world.
</p><p>Then as a snow Wocky literally in my element as a blizzard swirled around me. What an adventure <i>that</i> had been.
</p><p>Later as a baby Yurble in a dark cave lit only by the faint glow of magma as it streamed past. Being baby had been a blast. There was so much freedom in being an eternal child. I'd stayed that way for a decade but recently I'd decided I needed a change.
</p><p>Right now I am a woodland Xweetok. It suits me well and I finally feel like my true self. I had just been in the Brightvale library and was on my way to a destination unknown (even to me) when I found myself here.
</p><p>I draw myself from my thoughts. Here Cantata was asking for stories of my adventures and I'd not shared a single one with her!
</p><p>."For all my wandering, there is one place that I've been drawn to the most: Terror Mountain. Despite its fearsome name and reputation, I quickly grew to love the ever wintery environment and hardy 'pets that call it home. There's nothing more invigorating than a blizzard that dares you to face its icy wrath nor is there anything more soothing than drinking a bowl of hot soup, wrapped in the softest blanket in front of a crac.kling fire.".
</p><p>Cantata's eyes gleam as she listens. "You speak so fondly of your home. Yet you wander even now.".
</p><p>I grin. "Yes, I call Terror Mountain home but I've never been able to stay in one place for too long. I get restless and it only goes away when I've seen what's around the  next bend.".
</p><p>."A true wanderer," Cantata mused. Then she chirped. "A pleasure to have met you. You've given me inspiration for more songs to sing so I won't keep you any longer. Enjoy your next adventure!".

<h2>March 2022</h2>
<p>Dragao exchanged a look with Henry. They were facing something they never had before. To say the least, it was a bit daunting. For a long time, it had just been the two of them working in the library. Unlike their Tyrannian peers, they weren't interested in outdoor games. 
</p><p>It was how they had discovered the library in the first place. Dragao had found it first and then brought Henry. Once he had finally been painted into a brown Pteri, the two of them had worked together, restoring order to the long-abandoned library. Even after all these years, it had never stopped to interest them. They would be there right now except that Henry's sister had asked for help babysitting and they had agreed.
</p><p><i>What do we do now?</i>
</p><p>	They knew all too well that Tyrannians didn't enjoy scholarly pursuits; most of them couldn't even read. Though, that did not mean they didn't like stories. Between them, Dragao and Henry knew plenty of those. The trouble was that neither of them was very good at telling stories out loud.
</p><p>	The other problem was that Tyrannians loved tales of a rather, er, colourful nature. Stories of hunt and of war. Dragao and Henry knew Tyrannian history almost better than the average elder but those weren't the sorts of stories they enjoyed. So, what could they possibly share with these hatchlings that hadn't been shared before? It had to be something that would keep their interest, even if for half an hour. 
</p><p>	Then, inspiration struck and Dragao thanked the ancients for it.
</p><p>."Once upon a time there was a young, adventurer by the name of Jelli. He had traveled Neopia far and wide, climbed the highest peak of Terror Mountain and dived to the deepest part of Maraqua.  Yet, he didn't realize that his greatest adventure would be right here in his very homeland," Dragao began.
</p><p>	The relief on Henry's face meant that he understood exactly where his best friend was going with this story. It was one he had read before. In fact, one Dragao had told him back when he was just an egg. They had dismissed it as a tall tale but it appeared to be doing the trick. 
</p><p>."Jelli?" one little Pteri echoed with a frown. 
</p><p>."I never heard o' him!" another piped up. 
</p><p>	The eager listeners crowded closer to the storytellers, eyes alight with interest. 
</p><p>."That's right, Jelli," Henry confirmed with a nod before picking up where Dragao had left off. "Hungry for adventure, Jelli headed for the cave of the Pterodactyl and-".
</p><p>."Got eaten?!" one little Pteri gasped. 
</p><p>Another Pteri snorted. "Some adventure that was."
</p><p>."No, he didn't get eaten," Dragao assured. "He discovered something that no one believed possible and most still don't believe in to this day.".
</p><p>."What? What?".
</p><p>."What was it?".
</p><p>."He discovered a land made up entirely of an edible, gelatinous substance and, deciding to name it after himself, called it Jelly World," Henry said. 
</p><p>."Unfortunately, when Jelli tried to share his discovery with the world, they rejected him as a foolish youngster who had too much raw meat the night before. And yet, the story persists to this day," Dragao finished. 
</p><p>This started a lot of arguing between all the little Pteris as they debated whether they believed in Jelly World or not. 
</p><p>	Dragao and Henry exchanged a triumphant look. Mission accomplished!

<h2>February 2022</h2>
<p>Did she know?
</p><p>Trevor had known Victoria for four years. They had met in Kanto when they were eleven years old. They had both left their home regions for the first time on their journey. He could still remember the moment they'd met. He had been looking up at the contest hall for his first Kantonian contest and he was so focused on what was to come that he hadn't noticed at first that someone had walked up beside him.
</p><p>."Exciting, isn't it?".
</p><p>Trevor had turned his head to look at who had spoken and was momentarily dumbstruck. She was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen with long golden hair and sky blue eyes. He normally didn't find himself at a loss for words but it took him a moment to form a response. He swallowed to find his throat had gone dry.
</p><p>."I, uh," Trevor stumbled, unable to form a single coherent sentence. "Yes," he finally managed. Then the girl smiled at him and Trevor felt heat rush up to his face.
</p><p>What was happening to him?
</p><p>."You're a coordinator too, right?" the girl continued as if nothing were wrong.
</p><p>Trevor nodded, trusting that was the safest response for now.
</p><p>."I'm Victoria.".
</p><p>."Trevor.".
</p><p>."I look forward to seeing you in the contest.".
</p><p>Trevor had been blown away seeing Victoria in the contest. It was difficult for him to believe they were the same age. She was so sophisticated and competent. He felt like a complete novice in comparison. She was going to be a rival to look out for.
</p><p>As time went on, Trevor actually got to know Victoria. She was no snob, thinking she was better than anyone else. She was kind and modest, despite her obvious talent. She treated everyone as her equal, no matter their age or experience as coordinators. She wasn't just a rival, but a friend.
</p><p>Now, they were both fifteen and in Hoenn. For the first time, they decided to travel together. Trevor honestly loved spending time with Victoria and he had always wanted to spend more time with her. Now here the opportunity was and he felt like that first day they'd met: excited, nervous and totally unprepared for what the future had in store. They had developed an easy rhythm over the past four years but suddenly everything felt different.
</p><p>Trevor had always admired Victoria but that admiration had deepened into something <i>more</i>. Something exhilarating that he hadn't expected. Something that he couldn't keep to himself the longer he traveled with her. He wasn't one for keeping secrets. Certainly not something like this.
</p><p>He had to tell her.
</p><p>Had to let her know how he felt.
</p><p><i>Victoria, I love you.</i>

</p><p>~ ~ ~

</p><p>Did he know?
</p><p>Victoria had known Trevor for four years. Victoria had been eleven years old and had left her home region of Unova for the first time. She was excited to try her hand at contests in a new region and wondered how different things would be. There was so much she still had to learn! She was eager to improve and make new friends.
</p><p>Victoria still remembered arriving at the contest hall for her first contest and seeing a boy her age with sandy brown hair. He was looking up at the contest hall with a look of awe she was sure she had on her own face. He had to be a coordinator, too. A rival then. Though more than that, all she wanted was a friend.
</p><p>."Exciting, isn't it?".
</p><p>The boy had turned to look at her, green eyes wide. He was cute and she wondered for a moment if he was mute or maybe just shy? He stuttered but finally managed to speak. "Yes.".
</p><p>Victoria smiled then in a way she hoped would reassure him but then he blushed. Definitely shy then. "You're a coordinator too, right?".
</p><p>The boy nodded.
</p><p>."I'm Victoria.".
</p><p>."Trevor.".
</p><p>."I look forward to seeing you in the contest.".
</p><p>That first contest, Trevor had been more enthusiasm than anything else but Victoria loved it. Loved how readily he stepped out on stage with a smile on his face, completely comfortable out there. It didn't matter that he wasn't an expert. He was gonna have a great time anyway and made sure the audience did too. If only Victoria
could have that same easy manner. 
</p><p>Victoria knew how to have style, yes but Trevor? He knew how to have <i>fun</i>.
</p><p>With time, Victoria and Trevor got the chance to know each other. His shyness faded thankfully and Victoria got to see the real Trevor. He was friendly and had a unique outlook on contests and life in general. He wasn't just fun to be around, he was <i>funny</i> too. Not to mention, Victoria absolutely adored his Australian accent.
</p><p>Four years later they were in Hoenn and had made the decision to travel together. Victoria had never had a traveling companion before and had found that life on the road could be lonely. So getting to travel with Trevor was a great change of pace for her. Being in such close proximity made her feelings for Trevor only grow stronger. This
wasn't just friendship anymore.
</p><p>This was <i>love.</i>

<h2>January 2022</h2>
<p>Alyss walked down the hall doing her nightly rounds. She smiled as she passed each room.
</p><p>Slate and Teal-her oldest and youngest boys-shared a room. At fourteen, Slate was handsome, smart, with a love for theatre and family. Having been involved in the theater since he was four years old, his talent had improved. She slipped quietly into the room and gently moved the pages, setting them on the nightstand that stood between the two beds.
</p><p>Teal lay curled around Spike-his Togepi-as they slept. He had started kindergarten and was learning his letters. Already he loved learning and practiced his writing daily…even if that meant practicing on the walls or the furniture or his siblings. It
had been Blue's idea to give Teal his very own journal to write in. Alyss could see it now, a corner peeking out from beneath his pillow.
</p><p>Alyss walked across the hall to a paint splattered door that belonged to her two oldest girls. Stepping inside was a whirlwind of colour. On one side was Cerulean's sketches and fashion magazines. She had an eye for design and had recently started making friends with some other children with similar interests. Though it worried both of her parents slightly that these new friends might be a poor influence on her, Cerulean was the most like her mother with a mild manner hiding an inner steel that wasn't easily influenced by every whim.
</p><p>Sapphire was the artist of the family and she was sleeping soundly with her head nestled on her Wooloo's cloud-like fur. Wooloo's white fur was forever splattered with paint of all colours but the Normal type never seemed to mind. The only reason Sapphire wasn't in the same condition as her Pokémon was because she'd had her
bath before bed. The nightstand and the wall on Sapphire's side was forever changing in appearance. For the moment, it was a night sky covered in bright fireworks for the new year that had just passed days ago.
</p><p>Her second oldest son, Cobalt was the only one of her seven children to have a bedroom to himself. After the birth of Teal, he had insisted on it-refusing to share a bedroom with either of his brothers. He was her own personal shiny Pokémon, darker in personality and colour than his siblings but Alyss wouldn't have it any other way. He
reminded her of her father and Blue said he was also like his father, both stern men but Blue's father, at least, had also had a heart of gold under it all. Alyss knew that despite her son's fierce independence there was good in him too.
</p><p>Across the hall from Cobalt was the twins' bedroom. Maya was the most like her father, Blue. She was forever curious, eager to learn the hows and whys of everything! She was constantly nicking things from around the house and taking it apart though she hadn't quite gotten the hang of putting it back together again. Her side of the room was painted a to mimic a stormy day complete with dark clouds and jagged flashes of lightning.
</p><p>Sky was the calmer of the two but obsessed with flying. She was forever climbing things and launching herself off-thankfully where one of her older siblings or parents or a conveniently placed piece of furniture would catch her. She was basically a Bagon: small, blue and cute. Her side of the room was a bright sky blue with only a few fluffy
clouds scattered across it and darkening as they neared Maya's side. Alyss smiled to herself as she headed down the stairs.
</p><p>Blue was waiting for her in their loveseat. "Everyone snug in their beds?".
</p><p>."For now." Alyss curled into her husband's lap, his arms looping securely around her waist.
</p><p>."Did you ever imagine life would turn out like this?".
</p><p>."No more than you did," Alyss responded with a quirk of her lips.
</p><p>Blue's hold tightened only slightly. "I'm glad you didn't turn tail and run, even after how abominably I treated you that first year.".
</p><p>."Well, your family convinced me that there was more to you than a pretentious scientist.".
</p><p>."I'm glad you embraced our life of orderly chaos.".
</p><p>."I wouldn't have it any other way.".

<h2>December 2021</h2>
<i>A dream is a wish your heart makes</i>
<p>The mountains on the horizon, the open plain before me with the two-story house at its heart, even the woods I stand in are all achingly familiar. How far will I get this time? I can only wonder as I leave the shelter of the trees. I am fully exposed as the wind sweeps across the open space, its only trace the way the grass moves in an almost hypnotic dance. I walk with purpose, my eyes drinking in the deceptively simple structure as every step takes me that much closer to my destination.
</p><p>I open the door to reveal a hall that stretches to the back of the house where I know a combination of dining and living room is. But my eyes swing to the left where I know a conversation pit is and a kitchen just beyond that. It is the heart of this house and I turn left eagerly. I hesitate only a heartbeat as I see three men lounging in the pit, conversing quietly amongst themselves but not with spoken words, more with unspoken gestures that only comes from being identical triplets. I am one of the few that can actually tell the three of them apart and I have never mistaken one of them for the
others.
</p><p>Fellow sees me first, his brown eyes locking with mine, lips pulling into a warm smile. Almost simultaneously the other brothers-Speedo and Quick-turn to look at me and their expressions also change to ones of welcome. I return the smile and Fellow
shifts, making room beside him almost subconsciously. His brothers exchange a knowing look. They're convinced I have a favorite brother but Fellow and I aren't going to confirm or deny their belief. I nestle on the couch just within reach of Fellow's arm across the back of the couch.
</p><p>It is good to be back.
</p><p>The lads resume their conversation, this time their Scottish accents washing over me as they include me. I listen but my eyes also take in the rest of the open space. On the wall facing me is a large collection of picture frames scattered across it. Each of
them contains a loved one of mine, each diverse from the other. The running joke is that not a single one of my friends has a thing in common, other than that they know me.
</p><p>Yet, I love them all the same. I've earned their friendship over the years in varying ways. Each picture frame holds a memory and often more than one. Some of them are more precious than others. Those lost loved ones that I will never see again have not lost their place on the wall no more than they have lost their place in my heart.
</p><p>I don't turn to look but I know that on the wall behind me is an alcove without an easy way to access it. The space is filled with soft pillows, rugs, and blankets fit for lounging. Kitty's Corner, as it's called, for it was designed for my exclusive use. It's the only space that is 'off-limits' to others though it certainly isn't, if anyone else can reach it that is.
</p><p>To my right is a bedroom without a door, as it is most often used as a convalescence room. When I'm there, it's my bedroom though I typically share it with anyone that needs a place to sleep for the night. It's empty for now but that could change at a moment's notice. It is rare indeed when I lose my bed entirely but even when that happens, there are other options.
</p><p>Also on my right is a stairwell that leads to the second floor. It is pretty standard with only bedrooms and bathrooms. At full capacity, it has held as many as two dozen guests comfortably. Some would say the size is excessive, but I prefer being able to take care of my own. I've yet to turn anyone away for lack of space.
</p><p>To my left is the kitchen: big, open, and fully stocked. Many a meal has been prepared here and shared with friends from far-flung places. It has seen many things. Not just food and friendship but also more heartfelt things. Things that aren't so sweet to reminisce on but are important all the same.
</p><p>In the place where a pantry typically goes is a room that my friends have dubbed The Box. Really an all-purpose room that is practically a house within the house. It is fully equipped to be self-run in case of emergency with its own entrance and exit. It is
typically used as a nursery or for the critically ill. It has seen many an infant raised and invalid recovered.
</p><p>I know every nook and cranny of this house. After all, I designed it and helped build it with my own two hands. The land and the building were donated by a friend I helped when he desperately needed it. This house is more than just four walls to me. It's home.
</p><p>The rules are simple here. Guests i.e. anyone that stays for a month or less, are excluded from having to participate in household chores. You want to stay longer, you help clean, cook and care for every other member of the household. No drama is allowed, <i>ever</i>. Everyone is welcome but if you can't get along with everybody else, <i>you</i> no longer will be.
</p><p>It is a place where you are instantly comfortable because you are made to feel welcome. It can be <i>your</i> home if that's what you want or need. You will have a warm bed, a full belly and friendship. A place where you don't have to worry about being on your guard against anger or fear. A place where you can be yourself without judgment.
</p><p>The irony is that everyone can stay as long as they want, except me. This dream house that I created is only that: a dream. I can only stay as long as the dream lasts. For I am trapped in a reality where things are less than idyll, while everything within me yearns for a dream.
</p><p><i>But the thing about dreams is, they aren't</i> real

<h2>November 2021</h2>
<p><i>."What do you say…a memory for a key to the forest's hidden treasure?".</i>
</p><p>Of all the places I have been and the things I have seen, this is a new one. I am familiar with the various elemental faeries of Neopia but I have never even heard of this one. I hesitate as I gather my thoughts. Not all faeries are benevolent beings. It won't
do to press my luck.
</p><p>The faerie-Corraidhín-is asking for a memory in exchange for a hidden treasure. One of my longtime friends, Lofty, would accept the offer without question. He is a naturally curious fellow and always eager to explore new places in search of adventure. I am nowhere near as daring as he. My lifelong caution has kept me in good stead and I see no reason to change that now.
</p><p>."You may keep your treasure," I begin, reluctant to address the faerie by name but also wary of refusing her completely, "but if it is a memory you want, I have many to give.".
</p><p>There is a brief pause before Corraidhín tilts her head and waves her hand to proceed.
</p><p>."I was fifteen years old when a dear friend brought me to Anchor. It wasn't called Anchor then, it wasn't called anything then. It was only a modest farmhouse with a pond and a hill and a copse. Nothing like this of course," I say with a small gesture at the forest that surrounds us. "But it was enough. After wandering aimlessly through Neopia for five years, I had finally found a place where I could belong.".
</p><p>My voice softens as the memory overtakes me. I had been brought to tears by Lofty's generous offer. I was on the verge of refusing but the peace I felt there could not be denied. I had accepted on one condition: that Anchor would remain open to anyone else seeking a place to stay for however long they needed. Lofty agreed to my condition and thus Anchor began.
</p><p>Over time, others joined me at Anchor. Some stayed for only a night, others stayed much longer. I know the power that home and community can have on individuals. What I didn't plan on was my own impact on everyone that passed through Anchor's doors. For each of them I became a mentor, a friend and even a brother; many
of them I still keep in contact with to this day. 
</p><p>I grow wistful, a smile tugging at my lips as I recall this cherished time in my life. "I stayed at Anchor for five years with no intentions of leaving the home that I had created for myself and others.".
</p><p>."And yet you did," Corraidhín says.
</p><p>I nod, my smile growing. "I was eighteen when I met Hana. She was the most beautiful Ogrin I had ever seen." I chuckle, giving a short shake of my head. "I've always been shy and it takes patience for the average 'pet to get to know me. It didn't help that Hana was gorgeous. I could never seem to formulate coherent sentences around her. Yet, she <i>was</i> patient and waited for me to become comfortable around her. We fell in love and I had never been happier but-" Here my expression falls a little as I recall the conflict I had felt during that time.
</p><p>."To gain something so precious, you had to trade it for something equally so," Corraidhín says.
</p><p>I sigh. "Yes. Anchor was too important for me to just let go or see it closed forever but if Hana and I wanted to start our own family, I knew I had to leave. Thankfully, I found my replacement in Ezra, a Lupe with the same passion for helping others that I had. Once I knew I could pass Anchor on to his capable paws, Hana and I
left to start our own life together.".
</p><p>Corraidhín considers me in silence for a moment. "Do you regret your decision?".
</p><p>."Never," I reply at once. "We have two boys now and a home in Shenkuu. We're still surrounded by nature and I even founded a society of fellow nature lovers. My sons are following in my footsteps. While I will always cherish my memories of Anchor, I couldn't be happier with the life I have now.".
</p><p>I hope I gave a satisfactory answer. There is nothing I would change. All I can do is wait as Corraidhín twirls the key in her hand as she contemplates my fate.

<h2>Wings of Victory</h2>
<p>In the heart of Neopia Central there is a door. Average and unassuming, it is easily missed in the bustle of the city with bright colours and flashing lights. Unless you know where to look. The place had been recommended to me by a friend and, ever on the search for knowledge, I had come to check it out. With my purpose set, I pushed
open the door.
</p><p>I entered a spacious library and I took a moment to look around in awe. There were few places in Neopia that looked like this and it easily rivaled them in size. My eyes swept across the space and I was surprised to find that, other than books upon books, it was empty. I guess I couldn't be too surprised, given that it was an easy-to-miss place. I headed for a desk piled high with books to get a better look.
</p><p>As I hefted a sizeable tome in my hands, a voice spoke. "May I help you?"
</p><p>My eyes flashed up to see a small, toddler-sized brown Draik, his eyes sharp with a wisdom that belied his youthful appearance. Due to his small size and drab colour, it was no wonder that I had missed him. "Uh, maybe? My friend, Kaius told me about the archives here and I wanted to take a look around."
</p><p>The Draik nodded. "Then you have come to the right place. Is there anything in particular you are hoping to find?"
</p><p>."Not really. I've been in Neopia a long time but I always enjoy learning something new."
</p><p>."Ah, history! My favourite subject!" He rose from the desk chair he had been perched on, a pile of books giving him some much-needed height. He disappeared as he walked around the desk towards me. "Please, follow me."
</p><p>This little Draik was a conundrum. He was clearly knowledgeable about the archives and yet his size seemed to imply that he was very young. I wondered how best to voice my curiosity. "Do you come here a lot?"
</p><p>The small Draik looked up at me, an amused smile curving his lips. "You want to know how a baby Draik like me knows so much about Neopia and, specifically, these archives?"
</p><p>I nodded, relieved that he put it into words.
</p><p>."That's the thing everyone wants to know," he said with an easy shrug. "Well, my name is Petpage and these are <i>my</i> archives."
</p><p>I raised my eyebrows in surprise. "This place belongs to you?"
</p><p>."Indeed. Well, actually, I inherited it from my Petpet but its mine now. He taught me everything I know…which is quite a lot." He gave me a look from wizened eyes. "I'm older than I look, you know. Far, far older."
</p><p>."But how?" I was full of questions about this strange little Draik. The more I learned, the more I wanted to know!
</p><p>He gave a short sigh. "That is a story for another time. For now, I believe you'll find plenty to satisfy your curiosity with."
</p><p>."So, what all do you have here?"
</p><p>."Now that's my favourite question to answer!" He threw his hands out as it to encompass enormity of the library. "We have <i>everything</i>!"
</p><p>."Everything?" I echoed, the doubt clear in my voice.

</p><p>."Oh, yes!" He waved a hand towards different shelves as he talked. "You have questions about your Neopian experience? Check out a font guide! Or page layouts! Or take a look at our Impressive Achievements wall!"
</p><p>We reached the end of a row of shelves to a wall. The wall stretched far on either side and it was chock full of awards. There were sections for collectors, gamers and battledomers, amongst many others. My guide kept walking so I didn't linger, hurrying to catch up. He moved fast for having such short legs!
</p><p>."We have books on learning Tyrannian, exploring the Ice Caves and about the restoration of Krawk Island," he continued, not missing a beat, as if I had never stopped.
</p><p>."Or maybe you want to learn more about famous Neopians?" He nodded down another row of shelves. "Got a favourite hero or faerie? We got a book about 'em!" His eyes glistened, having fully warmed to his subject. "Or perhaps villains are more your speed? We have books a plenty about them as well."
</p><p>Petpage paused mid-step as we finally passed a row that <i>wasn't</i> empty. There was a cart full of books and an elderly Symol placing them back on the shelves. "Hullo, Petpetpage!"
</p><p>The elderly Symol adjusted his oversized spectacles and peered up at me with crescent-shaped eyes.
</p><p>."Yes, we have a visitor! Kaius told them about the archives and now they've come to see the place. So, I decided to give them a little tour."
</p><p>The Symol nodded and patted Petpage's hand fondly. I saw a Moach crawling along the top of his head but wisely kept my mouth shut.
</p><p>."Yes, of course I'll be sure to tell her," Petpage said with a nod. "I'll come back and help you sort books as soon as I've finished with our guest."
</p><p>The Symol returned to his work and Petpage moved on with me as his shadow.
</p><p>."Petpetpage reminded me that not everyone likes nonfiction. Perhaps fiction is more your speed? What's your favourite genre?" I opened my mouth to reply but the Draik steamed on. "Mystery, science fiction, poetry, or romance," here he raised his eyebrows at me in a meaningful way.
</p><p>My head spun with the wealth of information the Draik had divulged. I gave a little shake of my head as I processed it. "You really do have <i>everything</i>!"
</p><p>."As I said, my dear, whatever you fancy, you'll find here within these walls."
</p><p>."Is it alright if I just look around?"
</p><p>."Of course. If you do find yourself looking for something specific, please, let me know. I'll be happy to <i>direct</i> you." He chuckled to himself as if at some private joke.
</p><p>."Thank you." I began to browse and Petpage returned the way he came, soon lost amidst the shelves.
</p><p>I knew that I could easily spend hours here just looking at all the books and files within these walls. I wanted to learn it all! I was eager to get started. I plucked a book from a shelf, sat cross-legged on the floor and began to read.</p>

<p>Dagmier entered his workshop. It was a spacious room, filled with various bits and bobs that an inventor such as himself needed. It was messy and almost always chaotic, just the way he liked it. Due to this, it also tended to drive off the more orderly individuals in the king's employ, which meant that Dagmier also had plenty of privacy. Another thing he could be thankful for.
</p><p>The Usul headed for a familiar workbench and removed a golden comb from his pocket. He uttered the magic words and his comb transformed before his very eyes into a small robotic dog. It was one of his best inventions to date and the closest he ever came to an actual pet. He never had to worry about feeding him or bathing him or keeping him healthy like one would a normal pet. This suited Dagmier just fine as he was rather busy to take care of anyone other than himself.
</p><p>Still, Brushy Brushy, as he had named the automaton dog, was good. If others found out that he wasn't inventing things that could help Erea, he could lose his job. So, Dagmier made sure to make his workshop look the part. However, he really spent his time working with automatons that he liked.
</p><p>Dagmier had enjoyed tinkering for as long as he could remember. Taking things apart and finding out how they worked and reassembling them into something completely different were fun pastimes. They were unique puzzles with no blueprint to follow, just him and his own imagination leading the way. Often, his inventions led to naught. They were puzzles that couldn't be solved but he didn't mind.
</p><p>That was all part of the fun, too!
</p><p>An inventor's mind was never quiet, filled with ever new ways to impact the world around them. Dagmier was no different. His dreams had led him to some incredible inventions that had helped others in their day-to-day life, including himself. That's all he ever wanted. Not recognition but that he had made a difference with his work. Dagmier cleared up his workbench a bit, shifting the motor and fan belt he had been working on before he'd finally left the night before. He flicked off a few crumbs that had been leftover from some already forgotten meal and then his ice blue eyes darted over the various blueprints. He had more ideas than blueprints and more blueprints than he had time to work on them. Yet, he had to make a choice. At last, he plucked one from the pile and unfurled it on his workbench.
</p><p>."Okay, Brushy Brushy let's get to work!".

<h2>Wings of Virtue</h2>
<p>Vienterra sighed. She was getting bored again. Life had grown stale and she needed some new inspiration to continue her writing. That could be tough to do in the mundane area of Neopia she happened to live in. There was only one solution for boredom.
</p><p>	Adventure!
</p><p>	Decision made, Vienterra grabbed her bag that she always kept packed. It was always better to be prepared. One never knew when a new lead would pop up and she didn't want to be slowed down by necessities. She had everything she needed ready to go at a moment's notice. She dashed out the door without looking back, eyes fixed on the horizon. 
</p><p>	Artemis, her Vaeolus, was used to how quickly his owner moved and kept pace with her easily. She and her Vaeolus had been together a long time and her Petpet had been her faithful companion through all of their many adventures. He was intuitive, brave and loyal, all necessary for the sorts of sitauations they tended to get into. Vienterra couldn't imagine doing any of it without Artemis.   In short he was everything Vienterra could ask for in a Petpet and more importantly, a friend. 
</p><p>	They were currently heading for Shenkuu, the land of misty mountains, flying ships and rice bowls; Vienterra drooled at the thought then shook her head. Of course she wasn't going to Shenkuu just for the <i>food</i>. The mountainous region had so much more to offer than just that. She remembered years ago when the Cyodrake's Gaze had first made headlines across Neopia. It had inspired her deeply and for months afterward all of her characters and plotlines revolved around a plucky crew sailing the world with at least one traitor in their midst. 
</p><p>	The spotted Uni couldn't wait to visit Shenkuu for the very first time. It was everything it was promised to be and so much more. The land offered a rich culture and history that fascinated her. Not to mention the many 'pets she'd met with a quiet intensity like nothing she'd ever seen before. She had filled at least two notebooks with scribbled notes, doodles, half-baked ideas and characters as well as lots and lots of pictures.
</p><p>	They arrived in Shenkuu safe and sound. Vienterra stretched as she got off the plane. Flying was not the best method of travel. It wasn't fun being stuffed into uncomfortable seats for hours on end. Though, she knew the destination was definitely worth the pain of the journey. 
</p><p>	Vienterra headed straight for her hotel to drop off her bag. It was a traditional Shenkuu-style building and its wraparound walkway had a scenic view of a central courtyard. Despite the view, she didn't linger long. A surge of excitement rushed through her as she left her hotel. She had places to go, things to do and 'pets to see! 
</p><p>	 Vienterra headed for the nearest street vendor and got herself a bowl of yakisoba along with some meat skewers for Artemis. They enjoyed their delicious and filling meal with gusto, chatting it up with the street vendor and learning about the latest happenings in the neighborhood. She didn't know which she liked more: the food or the company. For the social Uni, it was difficult to choose. To her, this was what authentic travel was all about: experiencing the region like a local rather than an outsider.

<h2>Saving Shenkuu</h2>
<p>Collab with <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=josephinefarineii">Nebula</a>
</p><p><b>Word Count:</b> 2,030 words
</p><p>It was the month of Hunting and River had just arrived in Shenkuu. In his teens, he had traveled Neopia with the rest of the Kiko Lake Krew to participate in various swimming competitions. Now, however, he was alone. He wasn't on vacation but on a work-related trip. As a lifeguard and a proficient surfer, he had been selected to go to Shenkuu to learn about riverboarding as a lifesaving technique. 
	</p><p>Though, he had to admit, he was open to having fun, too! 
	</p><p>The one thing that had surprised him was that he had been directed to stay at the Lunar Temple. He understood the connection between the moon and its effect on water on Neopia but what did that have to do with learning how to riverboard? He supposed he would just have to find out! 
	</p><p>."Welcome to Shenkuu, young River. We hope you enjoy your stay in our temple," the head astronomer, a Gnorbu, said in a light Shenkuuvian accent. 
	</p><p>."Thank you," River said with a smile. 
	</p><p>."This is Mara, one of the temple disciples. She shall be your guide while you are here. She is mute and communicates through sign language but she does understand Common," the Gnorbu directed, waving a hand towards an Ixi in her early twenties like River. 
	</p><p>The Ixi smiled and waved cheerfully at River. 
	</p><p>."Good to know. Lead on!" River exclaimed. 
	</p><p>Mara first led him across the temple grounds where disciples were busy with their duties. Many of them gave River curious looks but didn't stop to chat. He got a good look at the temple grounds as they walked. Everything from the buildings to the carefully landscaped plants and water features rose and fell with the slope of the mountain, never going against its natural flow but flowing with it. It wasn't too long before they reached the temple dormitories.
	</p><p>Mara led him inside and down a short hall before sliding open a door to a small, sparsely furnished room with a flourish. She moved her hands in what River guessed to be the sign language the head astronomer had mentioned. 
	</p><p>."Sorry I don't understand you, Mara but I will, if you're willing to teach me!" River gave the Ixi a smile. 
	</p><p>She nodded enthusiastically. 
	</p><p>River quickly dropped his duffle on the floor mat where it appeared he would be sleeping. "Should have brought my own sleeping bag, eh?" He looked back over at Mara. "Having spent my day on the back of a Blurgah, I'm bushed! But I won't be able to sleep without a good meal in me first. Where can I get some grub around 'ere?"
	</p><p>Mara raised her hands as if about to say something when a gong sounded. The Ixi's ears twitched, and her eyes widened. She darted into the room, grabbed River's hand, and began to pull him along at a swift pace back the way they'd come. 
</p><p>With his long stride, he was able to keep up easily, laughing. "Don't tell me we're late for dinnah?" 
</p><p>Sure enough, they skidded to halt in front of what appeared to be a dining hall, others already streaming in to sit at the rows of tables. Mara led River to an open space, joined by another Ixi who gave River a curious look. 
</p><p>."You must be River, right? Come all the way from Kiko Lake to learn riverboarding," the new Ixi said. 
</p><p>River nodded. "Yeah, that's right."
</p><p>."Mara here jumped at the chance to be your guide. Riverboarding was created right here in Shenkuu, you know. You won't find a better place to learn how to do it."
	</p><p>."I look forward to learning it for myself though I'm not entirely sure why I was directed to the temple," River said.
	</p><p>."It's our location, honestly. We're close to a section of river perfect for surfing! Mara'll show you tomorrow!"
</p><p>River gave Mara a look of interest. "Are you a surfer, too?"
</p><p>Mara flinched, suddenly flustered. 
</p><p>River raised his eyebrows in surprise. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you, Mara."
	</p><p>During the meal, with Mara and Sio, the second Ixi, sitting across from him, River got an up-close look at the sign language that Mara used to communicate. Mara's earlier warmth had all but disappeared, ignoring River and speaking directly to Sio. The male Ixi gave River an apologetic look and continued to include him in conversation. River honestly wasn't sure how he had insulted Mara but didn't hold it against her. It took time but slowly, with Sio's help, Mara eventually relaxed after River's unintended overstep. 
</p><p>By the end of the meal he was able to pick up a few rudimentary signs. Though, he could barely keep his eyes open at the end of it. Traveling long distances always did that. He excused himself from the dining hall and made his way back to his room, arranging to meet Mara the next day. 

</p><div align="center">~ ~ ~ ~ ~</div>
	<p>The next day, River struggled to wake up, still bleary from travel. While staying in bed was tempting, he pushed himself to rise, not wanting to waste the opportunity he had been given. He had been chosen to learn a new technique to use for his job. He wasn't about to mess that up! He moved slowly but as he went through the motions of his morning routine, he perked up a bit, the sun and crisp air of the mountains affecting his energy. 
	</p><p>As he slid open the door to his room, he came face to face with Mara, who had a hand raised in preparation to knock. 
	</p><p>."Mornin', Mara!" River greeted with his signature grin. 
	</p><p>Mara used a sign to respond. That one, he guessed, was a greeting. She followed it up with another sign and looked at him expectantly. A question but what had she asked him?
	</p><p>River gave her a sheepish look. "I slept like a stone and probably would still be sleeping now but knew I had to get ready for lessons today. So, here I am. Upright and mostly awake."
	</p><p>Mara gave him a sympathetic look and stepped back in a silent sign for River to follow. They fell into step and quickly left the dormitory and the temple grounds behind altogether. He was careful to watch his step along the narrow, winding path that Mara led him down though he couldn't help letting his gaze take in the incredible views of Shenkuu. Majestic peaks capped with snow rose from the mist like so many fangs. The mist swirled and pooled across the landscape, softening everything it touched. While the ground was steep and rocky, water was plentiful in both trickling streams and swift rivers that both led to rushing falls that cascaded over the edges of the mountains and into empty air. 
	</p><p>This walk was longer than expected but River was used to hiking with his friends back home and didn't complain, content with the landscape and the silence. They didn't stop until they reached a deep valley with a lagoon, the first large pool of water River had seen since leaving the temple behind. It was late spring and cherry blossoms scattered the landscape. 
	</p><p>."This place is gorgeous!" River exclaimed. 
	</p><p>Mara smiled at him, allowing him to take it in before beckoning him on. 
	</p><p>The lagoon transformed from a pool to a stream and, at the first real cascade he'd seen, they stopped where two 'pets-a brown Techo and a white Lupe-stood waiting. River recognized them as Bowe and Cassile, two world-renowned surfers and professional riverboarders. They had agreed to teach him the sport and how to apply it to rescue work. As an avid surfer himself, he had long heard of the two of them and he felt a rush of excitement that he was not only getting to meet them, he was going to be taught by them, too! 
	</p><p>He looked over at Mara. "Thank you," he said out loud and also used the sign he had picked up over dinner the night before. 
	</p><p>Mara beamed at him, pleasantly surprised at the gesture. "You're welcome," she signed back. She pointed back towards the lagoon and signed something else that River didn't catch. 
	</p><p>."I'm not sure how long I'll be but you don't have to wait for me. I understand you've duties back at the temple. I'm sure I'm in excellent hands with Bowe and Cassile."
	</p><p>Mara cocked her head, looking past River at the waiting riverboarders. She shrugged and then turned, pausing only to wave goodbye before heading back the way they'd come. 
	</p><p>River turned back to his new teachers with an eager grin, ready to get this new adventure started. </p>
<div align="center">~ ~ ~ ~ ~</div>
<p>Mara waited at the hidden lagoon for River to make his return. She was uncertain whether he would be able to find his way back, given his unfamiliarity with Shenkuu and she didn't want to risk him losing his way. While she had regular duties to attend to at the temple, they had been temporarily suspended during the course of River's stay. It meant she had a bit more free time than she usually did. She knew just how to spend it. 
</p><p>	It was late afternoon before she saw the brown Lutari again. 
</p><p>.	"Mara, you waited for me," River said, coming over a small rise to see the Ixi on the lagoon's shore. 
</p><p>.	"I'm surprised you were able to find your way back here," Mara signed. 
</p><p>	River gave a sheepish smile. "I have a strong sense of direction so I knew I'd be alright but thank you. Its nice to have the company on the walk back."
</p><p>	River seemed to instinctively understand her meaning, even if he didn't understand her signs directly. It made Mara feel heard in a way that she hadn't expected to have right away with a total stranger. 
</p><p>	Once more, they fell into step, heading back the way they'd come just that morning.
</p><p>.	"How were your lessons?" Mara asked, giving River a curious look. 
</p><p>.	"My lessons went well. Riverboarding is similar enough to surfing that I was able to pick it up quick. Which is good because I don't have that much time here in Shenkuu to learn it. I have to be back in Kiko Lake by the end of the month to prepare for our busy summer season."
</p><p>	Mara nodded. "From what little I've seen of you, River, I think you'll be just fine." She gave him a reassuring smile. 
</p><p>	They fell into silence then, each lost to their own thoughts. 
Dusk came early to the mountains and the transition from day to night was swift. As they reached the final rise, they just made it. One moment, the world was all warmth and light and the next everything was inky black, the sky dappled with stars. 
</p><p>	Mara's eyes lit up. It was her favourite time! She tugged River's hand and led him to a hillock with a clear view of the sky. With nothing but sky ahead of them and above them, it felt like they were floating in a sea of stars. She gave a happy little sigh, gaze shining with starlight. 
</p><p>	She looked over at River. "I almost feel like I could touch the stars from here."
</p><p>	River nodded, his own gaze taking in the silent night around them. "It is beautiful out here. Kiko Lake has a brilliant night sky but nothing like this. I'm only familiar with the constellations from there and Mystery Island but that's halfway across Neopia. I'd love to learn about the constellations here."
</p><p>	Mara leaned close and spent the next half hour or so, pointing out constellations, giving their names and a bit of lore if she knew it. It didn't matter that River didn't understand most of what she said, he watched her intently regardless. At times, she would take his hand and trace a constellation in the sky, pointing out the brightest stars and what they represented. 
</p><p>	They only stopped when a gong sounded, reminding them of the curfew for the temple. 
</p><p>.	"I'm glad I came here and not just because I'm learning something important for work," River said. "But because I got the chance to meet you, Mara."
</p><p>.	"I'm glad I got the chance to meet you too, River," Mara responded. </p>

<h2>Call to Arms</h2>
<p>Collab with <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=saintsalmon">Clive</a>
</p><p></p>
<p><b>Word count:</b> 2,585 words
	</p><p>The sedate, orderly world of Brightvale had turned to chaos. It had happened in an instant, with no warning to prepare them. Now, the world felt like it was falling apart around their ears. The castle had crumbled, with no word on what had happened to King Hagan. Brightvalians were running for their very lives, driven by fear and horror at the state of their home. 
	</p><p>But some weren't running. 
	</p><p>The Brightvale Guard and a small division of the Meridellian Guard were doing their best to step into the fray to help where they could. Soldiers were scattered throughout the village, trying to guide lost and frightened 'pets out of the village to somewhere safe and quiet. Others were gearing up to fight, swords and shields in hand as they rushed towards the rampaging Epuni. Cries of fear and anger mingled together, harsh against even the dullest of ears. In the chaos, heroes rose up from the most ordinary and unexpected places. 
	</p><p>Orien was a young Meridellian soldier, his regiment in Brightvale for what was supposed to have been routine training. But there was nothing routine about <i>this</i>. The young Gelert had been ordered by his commanding officer to help evacuate the village. Get everybody out. <i>No one stays behind</i>. 
	</p><p>Duty bound, Orien was determined to do just that. Unfortunately, he was having little success. He was nothing more than a rank and file soldier, more accustomed to receiving orders than giving them and everyone around him knew it.
	</p><p>."Everybody, out!" Orien barked, voice shrill with his own heightened emotion. 
	</p><p>Villagers cast him nothing more than a passing glance, taking in his standard Meridellian uniform and youthful appearance and disregarded him completely. They continued what they were doing, seemingly unconcerned by the giant Epuni destroying their home. Some of them even appeared to slow down and Orien growled with frustration.
	</p><p>."There's an Epuni destroying the castle and everybody needs to evacuate! <i>Now</i>!" Orien barked, trying to channel the authoritative tone of his father and failing miserably.
	</p><p>He had barged into a pub and the occupants didn't budge. 
	</p><p>Seeing their indifference, Orien's flimsy confidence collapsed. "Please, you have to leave now. The Guard is doing their best to control the Epuni but if they fail, there's no telling what could happen." He looked around but his plea seemed to fall on deaf ears.
	</p><p>."Not fore I finish my pint, I'm not," a surly old Korbat growled. 
	</p><p>Only one other occupant moved, an elderly Yurble. He rose from his barstool with a low grunt, grabbing the beat-up old satchel at his feet. "If its time to go, its time to go," he said calmly. 
	</p><p>The others at the bar with him exchanged looks. 
	</p><p>."If'n he's goin', we'll go," one of the other old timers said. 
	</p><p>Slowly, they began to pack up and shuffle out the door. They stomped past Orien, grumbling the whole way but at least they were moving. 
	</p><p>The old Yurble was one of the last out. He paused to look at Orien. "We know you're just doing your job. Its not easy but somebody's gotta do it." He gave the green Gelert a considering look. "Do you need any help? I was a soldier like you once, years ago. I know what it's like to do mere grunt work."
	</p><p>Orien was taken aback by the offer. "Uh, thanks but I don't think I can let you do that. I mean,  you're not a soldier now, just a civilian. And besides you're uh, you know..." he gestured awkwardly at the Yurble, suddenly losing steam as he realized he couldn't just call someone, well, <i>old</i>.
	</p><p>The old Yurble did not take offense to the young Gelert's response. "Understood. Well, keep up the good work." He exited the pub and joined the stream of evacuating villagers.  
	</p><p>With the pub now empty, Orien moved on to the next building, the order of his superior officer ringing in his head: <i>No one stays behind</i>. 
	</p><p>In all the commotion, Orien's attention was drawn to a tiny figure standing stock-still in the middle of it all; so small that he almost missed it until he drew closer. It was a small Kougra with big scared eyes, looking as lost and forlorn as only a child could. 
	</p><p>."Hey! What are you doing out here all alone? Where are your parents?" Orien questioned the young Kougra, looking around but not seeing anyone that appeared to be missing a child.
</p><p>."I, I do-don't know. They were just go-gone!" The Kougra's eyes began to well with tears. 
	</p><p>."Oh, don't do that. Please, don't cry!" Orien wasn't exactly known for his comforting demeanor. He didn't have much experience in general, let alone with kids. He was at a loss how to make it better.
	</p><p>As the child began to wail, Orien looked around helplessly. In the chaos, no one spared them a second glance, too preoccupied with their own escape to notice. Except for one. 
	</p><p>Suddenly, a hulking figure ambled up to join them. 
</p><div align="center">~ ~ ~ ~ ~</div>
	<p>The old Yurble's knees crac.ked as he knelt in front of the little Kougra. He drew an old hanky from his shirt pocket and began to wipe the child's tears away. "Hush, now," he said in a low, soothing rumble. "I know you're scared but we'll find your family. Everything's going to be fine, okay?" He paused in his ministrations to give the child a reassuring smile, his brown eyes somehow managing to crinkle even now. 
	</p><p>The little Kougra sniffled, the tears having subsided as the old Yurble talked. She nodded and took a shaky breath. "Okay," she managed to say. 
	</p><p>."What's your name, little one?"
	</p><p>."My name is Cassie."
	</p><p>."That's a beautiful name," the Yurble said. "My name is Mr. Yurbleson but everyone calls me Mr. Yubby."
	</p><p>Cassie couldn't help a smile at that, the hint of a fang peeking out. 
	</p><p>The Yurble rose to his feet and the Kougra placed her small, pale hand in his big, dark one. "Now, let's see if we can find your family. Do you know where you live?"
	</p><p>Cassie looked around uncertainly. "Um, I think over there!" She pointed down the street back towards the castle and the rampaging Epuni. 
	</p><p>."Hang on!" the young soldier finally interrupted. "It's not safe to go back!"
	</p><p>Mr. Yurbleson turned his old, weary gaze on him. "I know you have a job to do but Cassie is my priority right now." He paused for a moment as he saw the soldier trying to argue. "And just think, do you really want to deal with an upset family trying to find their missing daughter? There's no way they'd leave cooperatively without her."
	</p><p>Fine," the soldier sighed, "but I still have to clear the rest of the village so there's no guarantee that you'll be safe out here."
	</p><p>."I understand you have your duties to fulfill. I'll take full responsibility for Cassie until she's safely back with her family." 
</p><p>The young soldier seemed uncertain and Mr. Yurbleson could see that he was torn as he debated with himself. At last, he nodded. "Very well." He gave them one last anxious look before continuing on his way.
	</p><p>Mr. Yurbleson walked with Cassie. Suddenly, there was the pounding of feet as two 'pets raced towards them. They barreled between them, separating the pair. Cassie screamed and Mr. Yurbleson quickly pushed the little Kougra protectively behind him.
	</p><p>."We don't want any trouble, fellas," Mr. Yurbleson warned, keeping his tone intentionally light so as not to scare Cassie. Though, he braced himself for anything the pair might try. 
</p><p>They weren't armed from what he could see but they assessed him with sharp eyes.
</p><p>."What's in the bag, old man?" one of them, a red Ixi, demanded.
</p><p>."Nothing of import. Just some odds and ends that I thought I might need for a day out," Mr. Yurbleson replied calmly.
</p><p>."Then you won't mind if we take a look," the other, an electric Zafara, growled.
</p><p>Mr. Yurbleson could feel Cassie trembling behind him. He really didn't want trouble and was mindful that his first priority was to protect Cassie. At the same time, he didn't just want to give up without a fight. After all, who knew what these two ruffians might try if they thought they could get away with it? 
</p><p>The two thugs closed in and Mr. Yurbleson braced himself. One of them lunged but the still brawny Yurble was able to shrug him off. The other came at his shoulder and Mr. Yurbleson turned to meet him. Momentarily distracted, the Ixi suddenly put him in a headlock but with one deft move, Mr. Yurbleson flung the Ixi off, slamming him to the ground. The Ixi got the breath knocked out of him and the Zafara scowled, clearly not quite ready to give up.
</p><p>The Zafara lunged forward, fist clenched but the old Yurble was able to block it with his forearm. By then, the Ixi had scrambled to his feet and charged Mr. Yurbleson, knocking him off balance. He wasn't as young as he used to be and fell hard, winded. 
</p><p>."Just stay down, old man!" the Zafara ordered.
</p><p>Cassie screamed again in fright.
</p><p>Perhaps this had been a mistake after all. He turned his face to the side and saw a welcome sight: the young soldier from before! Their gazes locked and the soldier nodded. They weren't beaten yet! With a surge of long-dormant strength, Mr. Yurbleson heaved himself to his feet and the soldier burst out from a nearby alley. 
</p><p>With this reinforcement, the fight was more equal than before. The Ixi and Zafara, suddenly finding they had gotten more than they bargained for, tried to run but were quickly overwhelmed by Mr. Yurbleson and the soldier fighting together. It didn't take long for the old Yurble's fighting ability to come back to him and he matched the young soldier blow for blow. In moments, both ruffians were in handcuffs and under custody of the soldier.
</p><p>."Thanks for coming in when you did," Mr. Yurbleson said with a nod towards the soldier. "I might have been able to handle one but I haven't faced two opponents in, well, probably longer than you've been alive."
</p><p>."I'm glad I was able to help," the soldier said, giving Mr. Yurbleson an admiring look. "You certainly held your own before I got there!"
</p><p>."I told you, I was a soldier once. That instinct, while deeply buried, doesn't ever truly leave you." 
</p><p>Suddenly, Cassie hugged Mr. Yurbleson and he quickly put his arm around her. "Are you alright, Cassie?"
</p><p>The little Kougra trembled but nodded. "Yeah, but that was so scary! I thought they were really gonna hurt us."
</p><p>."They tried but I wasn't gonna let them hurt you, Cassie." Mr. Yurbleson hugged her close for a moment. He looked back up at the soldier. "Can you manage on your own from here? I really do need to get Cassie reunited with her family." 
</p><p>."These two shouldn't be much of a problem anymore but I'd like to continue on with you, at least until Cassie is reunited with her family. That is, if you don't mind?"
</p><p>."We would be glad of the company," Mr. Yurbleson assured. "You know our names but what is yours?"
</p><p>."Orien Clarke, Meridellian guard-in-training," the green Gelert responded, extending a hand to shake.
</p><p>As Mr. Yurbleson clasped Orien's hand, he could see the Gelert's eyes light up with surprise at the firmness of his grip.
	</p><p>Mr. Yurbleson walked ahead with Cassie and they didn't get far before an adult Kougra came into view. 
	</p><p>."Cassie!" the Kougra called, eyes racing across the still crowded street. 
	</p><p>."Mama!" Cassie called back. 
</p><p>At hearing this, the two raced to meet each other, coming to a tearful reunion in the street.  
</p><p>Cassie's mom hugged her tight, checking her over anxiously. "Are you hurt, baby?"
</p><p>Cassie shook her head. "I was so scared, Mama but then Mr. Yubby came and helped me find you!"
</p><p>The adult Kougra looked up at Mr. Yurbleson, eyes shining with gratitude. "Thank you so much! I was frantic when I realized Cassie had somehow gotten separated from us." 
</p><p>."Its not a problem. I have children of my own so I understand how these things can happen."
</p><p>Cassie's mom ushered her daughter away to where two more Kougras were waiting with a pile of belongings. The family continued on their way outside of the village. 
</p><p>Mr. Yurbleson looked at Orien. "Now, lets see to these two."
</p><p>."Right!" Orien agreed.
</p><p>They continued heading towards the edge of town where a crowd had begun to form. This was a mere stopping point for folks who needed first aid or a safe place to rest before continuing to evacuate further away from the ongoing destruction. They were able to hand over the Ixi and Zafara to the authorities who were busy processing others that had taken advantage of the rapidly emptying village to pursue criminal activities. 
</p><p>."With the village now evacuated, the Guard needs all the help it can get in taking down that Epuni so arm yourself and get going," the commanding officer, a white Lutari, ordered Orien. 
</p><p>."Yes, sir!" Orien saluted. 
</p><p>."I'd like to volunteer my services as well," Mr. Yurbleson said, stepping forward to stand besides Orien. 
</p><p>The Lutari frowned. "We don't need civilians getting in the way while we're trying to deal with the Epuni."
</p><p>."Actually, sir, he proved himself quite capable while evacuating the village," Orien put in quickly. Then, he seemed to lose his nerve as he realized how bold he had been in disagreeing with the commanding officer. "Uh, I mean, its up to you but he helped take down two common thieves so maybe, reconsider?"
</p><p>The Lutari sized the old Yurble up. "You understand that you are putting yourself into mortal peril? And if you agree to participate in the fight against the Epuni, you may become severely injured or potentially lose your life?"
</p><p>."I understand the risks, sir." Mr. Yurbleson responded with a firm nod. 
</p><p>."Very well. Arm yourselves and get over there as quickly as you can. We need to deal with this Epuni <i>now</i> before it decides to move on to other regions."
</p><p>."Yes, sir!" Mr. Yurbleson and Orien saluted together. 
</p><p>They headed for the impromptu armory where a purple Kau was arming soldiers. 
</p><p>."What'll you have?" the purple Kau grunted. 
</p><p>."Sword and shield for me," Orien said. 
</p><p>."War hammer for me," Mr. Yurbleson said. 
</p><p>Both the young soldier and the armorer looked at the elderly Yurble with surprise. 
</p><p>."You sure about that?" the armorer asked, giving the Yurble a closer look. "That ain't a weapon for the weak, or 'scuse me, infirm."
</p><p>."I'm certain. It was the weapon I used in my youth and the one I know how to handle best," Mr. Yurbleson said. 
</p><p>."Believe me, he can handle it," Orien put in, casting an almost shy glance at Mr. Yurbleson with a brief wag of his tail.
</p><p>."Alright, if you're sure," the armorer said, drawing up the nearest war hammer and handing it over. 
</p><p>Mr. Yurbleson stood there in his borrowed armor and hefted the war hammer in both hands. He had forgotten what it felt like but just holding the hammer brought everything rushing back at once. 
</p><p>."Are you ready to go?" Orien asked, breaking in to his reverie.
</p><p>The Yurble looked up at the soldier and the armorer, grip tightening on the hammer. He pushed away the memories, knowing that that would have to be held off for another time. His face hardened with determination. "Let's go.".</p>
