<p><b>About the Rubber Duck Mission:</b><br>
The Rubber Duck Mission was founded on the 11th of April, 2004 by the <a>HelpYourNeopet Guild</a> and aims to promote helpfulness in Neopia. By getting the Rubber Duck message and Rubber Ducks into as many Neopian shops as possible.

</p><p><b>What's Helpfulness?</b><br>
Helpfulness is the act of giving hel-blocked-eople to donate neopoints and items to the Money Tree, answer questions on the Help NeoBoard, look up items for people on the Quest NeoBoard and report any possible scams that you see around the Neopets site.

</p><p><b>How to get involved:</b><br>
The first thing to do is start being helpful, donate to the Money Tree, answer questions, report scams etc. and you don't have to stop being helpful once you log off Neopets either!<br>
The second thing to do is to help promote the Rubber Duck Mission and put a Rubber Duck in your shop or userlookup.
