		<h4> Transcript</h4>
<p><i>In a garden full of dangerous looking plants on Darigan Citadel, Razor Griff gently holds a snapping flower</i></p>
		<p class="ts">
		<b>ShereKong:</b> Is that safe Razor Griff?</p>

		<p class="ts"><b>Razor_Griff:</b> Mostly.
		<br>I just need to keep my fingers clear... annnd... There! Done!
		<br>These snappers will help protect the new berry and veg patch from pests.</p>

		<p class="ts"><b>ShereKong:</b>  Is this what you went to the Tri-Kingdoms summit for?</p>

		<p class="ts"><b>Razor_Griff:</b> Yea! Meridell and Brightvale are both helping to solve Darigan's farming challenges.
		<br>Meridell is sending fertilizer to replace toxic soils.
		<br>And Brightvale is using hybrid fruit techniques to make plants more resilient.</p>

		<p class="ts"><b>ShereKong:</b> We've come a long way since the wars. Everyone is working together to heal.</p>

		<p class="ts"><b>Razor_Griff:</b> Yea... And I want to do more.</p>

		<p class="ts"><b>Brochure with Darigan, Brightvale and Meridell crests Reads:</b> TRI-KINGDOM JOINT PATROL. Growing in friendship. Enlist today!

	<h4>Extras</h4>
<p>The garden is based on the Darigan Gardens (TCG), as well as Spiked Dariberry and Darigan Gardening Set.</p>

<p>I used the idea of the Tri-Kingdoms Summit from <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=parody_ham"> Parody_ham</a>s short story <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=586432&amp;week=959"> The Tri-National Summit</a>, but I forgot what she called it and named it the Tri-Kingdoms Summit instead. It's also referenced in her story <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=586600&amp;week=963"> Watching Petals</a> and more.

	<h4>Transcript</h4>
	<p><i> ShereKong does the dishes as Ice_Rocket enters the room and grabs a drink</i></p>

	<p><b>ShereKong:</b> Ice_Rocket! You're back! How was the interview?</p>

	<p><b>Ice_Rocket:</b> Eh. Same old. </p>

<p><i>Flashback to earlier; Ice sits in an office, playing with a bobblehead toy while being interviewed by a light, job faerie.</i></p>

	<p><b>Faerie:</b> And where would you search for medicinal mud?</p>
	<p><b>Ice_Rocket:</b> Well I'd start with my backyard and add water...
	<br>Then throw a label on it! </p>
	<p><b>Faerie:</b> I don't think you're the right fit.</p>

<p><i>Back at the house, in the present.</i></p>
	
	<p><b>ShereKong:</b> You can't keep throwing these. You need a job.</p>

	<p><b>Ice_Rocket:</b> Why? Griff got a job and he hates it. </p>

	<p><b>ShereKong:</b> He does not hate work.</p>

<p><i>The front door creaks open and Razor_Griff enters. The camera cuts closer to show a sobbing Griff</i></p>

	<p><b>Razor_Griff:</b> Everyone at work HATES me!</p>


	<h4>Extras</h4>
	<p>The comic in the NT has the original text bubbles. I redid them and resubmit before I was selected, but they published the old version before they saw this cleaned up one.</p>

<p><i>ShereKong hands over a Tyrannian Army medal. It says 5 battles, 2 points.</i></p> 

	<p class="ts"><b>Razor_Griff:</b>You're right ShereKong. I'll get stronger the same way.

<h3>Out of Place</h3>

<p><a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=588447&amp;week=981">Published in NT 981</a></p>

<h4>Transcript</h4>

<p><i>Razor_Griff and Ice_Rocket stroll through the streets of Darigan Citadel. They are surrounded by darigan pets going about their day.</i></p><p>

</p><p><i>They buy a new skateboard from the Darigan Moehog who runs the toy shop.</i></p>
<p><i>A Darigan Chomby baker offers a selection of darigan loaves of bread.</i></p>
<p><i>A Darigan Wocky helps them select a book.</i></p>
<p><i>They walk by darigan children playing a game of double dutch with spikey darigan jump ropes, singing a creepy nursery rhyme.</i></p>
<p class="ts"> <b>Griff:</b> Hey Ice? Do you ever feel out of place living in the citadel?</p>
<p><i>A wide view reveals the citadel streets full of many pets, not just darigan coloured pets, but colours of many weird varieties such as plushie, robot,  tomato, and more.</i></p>
<p class="ts"><b>Ice_Rocket:</b> Nah.</p>

<h4>Extras</h4>

<p>The <b>Dairgan Loaf</b> the Chomby is selling is an item in game. It's description says "Most will tell you it is utterly tasteless. Some will say it tastes like sadness, but one thing is certain... Darigans love it!". <b>Darigan Jump Rope</b> can be bought from Darigan Toys. And yes. It's very spikey.</p>

<p><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bak_darigan_loaf.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/dto_darigan_jumprope.gif"></p>

<p>I based my idea for Darigan Citadel's streets on Edinburgh's multi-level city streets of bridges, vaults, and stairs layered on hills and covered in cobblestone. But then I made it dark and added lots of spikes. Minion Lane is the name of one of the streets for classic neohomes.</p>

<p><b>The Nursery Rhyme</b>
<br>1, 2, 3, Please Remember Me.
<br>Went into the woods and forgot your family.
<br>4, 5, 6, Now the statue can't be fixed.
<br>Tried to save (unreadable) -iends
<br>And now (unreadable) of sticks</p>

<h4>Transcript</h4>

<p><i>At home, Ice and ShereKong relax on the couch.</i></p>
<p class="ts"><b>Griff: </b>Hey, I'm back from the Lab.</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Shere: </b>Hey Griff. You seem different today... are those...

<p class="ts"><b>Shere:</b> You uh, feeling OK about the uhh..</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Griff:</b> Oh! Yea. It's a litter weird getting zapped female. But I knew this might happen. It's not like it chooses who I am.</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Shere:</b> But what if you change into something you can't stand?
<br> And... and you get desperate then drink a potion of transmogrification.
<br> Then Sloth returns to brainwash you!?!</p>

<h4>Extras</h4>

<p>The day this published the pound got flooded by people morphing pets into pirate eyries. It's not the first or last time that's happened. So it may or may not have been influenced by this. Oops.</p>

<h3>Like a Fyora Tale</h3>

<p><a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=588680&amp;week=984">Published in NT 984</a>

</p><h4>Transcript</h4>

<p><i> ShereKong sorts papers labelled "Budget" at his desk as Razor_Griff -now a Tuskaninny- opens the office door cautiously.</i></p>

<p class="ts"><b>Griff:</b> Hey ShereKong? You in here?</p>
<p class="ts"><b>S.K.:</b> Yea, just finished this month's budget. What's up Razor_Griff?</p>
<p><i>Griff Reveals a grumpy looking, green lutari kid he's holding in his arms.</i></p>
<p class="ts"><b>Griff:</b> Say hello to Lar_Suny. We're adopting her.</p>
<p class="ts"><b>S.K.:</b> Uhhhh... what... Say that again?</p>

<p><i> <b>Griff explains in a montage drawn in speech bubbles:</b></i></p>
<p><i> A Lutari, (Lar), jumps into the river holding a bag, her face hidden in shadow with a wicked grin. Griff's patrol group chases after her as a kacheek points her out.</i></p>
<p><i> Griff stands by the river as Captain Skardell hovers above him in the air surveying the area.</i></p>
<p><i>Griff jumps into the river.</i></p>
<p><i>Beneath the water, Griff pursues the lutari against the current.</i></p>
<p><i> He catches her holding - the tale is interrupted by a childish drawing of a two headed scorchio as Lar_Sunny's narration butts in.</i></p>
<p><i>The story is overtaken by Lar, her own speech bubbles pushing Griff's out of the way. An earth and dark faerie blast the two headed scorchio away. Lar's scribbles over Skardell and Griff say "We wish we were as cool as Lar". Fyora hands her a big bag of neopoints and says "Lar is the best!</i></p>

<p class="ts"><b>Griff:</b> That is NOT what happened.</p>
<p class="ts"><b>S.K.: </b> I dunno... I think I like her version better.</p>

<p><i> ShereKong drops the now shredded budget papers.</i></p>


<h4>Extras</h4>
<p> It took me a year since I first started publishing in the NT again to get Lar_Sunny introduced, even though I got her the same month I returned to neo. I drew Griff holding Lar the week I got her, then shrunk down the sketch for this comic.</p>

<h3>Thundersticks</h3>

<p><a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=588918&amp;week=987">Published in NT 987</a></p>

<h4>Transcript</h4>

<p><i>ShereKong, Lar_Sunny, Ice_Rocket, and Razor_Griff are all dressed up for Team Darigan for the Altador Cup</i></p>

<p class="ts"><b>S.K. : </b>O.K. Lar, are you ready to make some noise?</p>

<p><i>Lar excitedly holds up two neon sticks with static crickling around them.</i></p>

<p class="ts"><b>Lar:</b> Yea! Check out what I found in Griff's room!</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Griff:</b> Wait... are those my-</p>

<p><i>KRRRCHOOOM!! The Thunder Sticks smack together creating a small explosion of sound!</i></p>

<p><i>Lar_Sunny stands astonished in the middle of the Altador Cup stands, the crowd all around her stunned by the battledome weapons and crickling with leftover static</i></p>

<h4>Extras</h4>

<p>I asked my friends and any NT comic artist who'd used their own pets in a comic in the past year to cameo for the crowd, (and I got their permission to knock out their characters). Only 2 people never got back to me so it was an amazing turnout!</p>

<p>Here's a list of all the crowd cameos and where they come from! Not all characters are real pets on the site. Friends' pets without a public presence have had their names shortened to protect their lookups.</p>

<p><a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=589144&amp;week=989">Published in NT 989</a></p>

<p><i>An exhausted tuaskanniny form Razor_Griff, heads down a street, with Ice_Rocket on a skateboard, rapidly approaching</i></p>

<p class="ts"><b>Ice:</b> Hey Griff! Wait up!
<br>Woah dude! You look exhausted! where you headed?</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Griff:</b> The Lab. I'm still not used to not having legs... or wings.</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Ice:</b> That's why I picked up skateboarding on land! Try it out!</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Griff:</b> I forgot you were a Tuskaninny once. Why poogle? Why not a flyer?
<br> Wait... did this board get longer?</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Ice:</b> Flying is just swimming with fall damage.
<br>Speaking of... Take this, hop on, and let's go!</p>
<p><i>Ice offers Griff a helmet. Griff's trying to figure out where it came from, Ice doesn't have a bag with him.</i></p>
<p><i>Ice_Rocket pushes Griff along on the skateboard, with the background zipping by.</i></p>

<h4>Extras</h4>
<p>I really like the way <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=589046&amp;week=988">Saintsalmon</a> had been doing the backgrounds in Ashkary's Cafe. This isn't as refined or detailed as their technique, but I wanted to try a more sketchy, limited palette for the backgrounds to see if I could get more detail with less loss of time and KB space. This is something I continue to experiment with.</p>

<h4>Transcript</h4>

<p><i>Razor_Griff (still a tuskaninny) and Ice_Rocket sit in the waiting room for the Secret Lab.</i></p>

<p class="ts"><b>Ice:</b> So, other than no walking legs, how's Tusk' life treating ya?</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Griff:</b> Not bad actually.
<br>I've enjoyed diving. It's hard to swim with eyrie wings. I'd like to visit Maraqua, explore the ruins. Or check out Kiko Lake's gardens!</p>

<p class="ts"><b>Voice from inside the Lab:</b> NEXT!</p>

<p class="ts"><b>Griff:</b> That's my turn!</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Ice:</b> Good luck! I'll see about booking you a Terror Mountain, ice dive tour!</p>

<p><i><b>ZAP</b></i></p>

<p><i>Griff Emerges from the Lab, now a giant Chia.</i></p>
<p class="ts"><b>Griff:</b> Don't book the tour...</p>

<p><i>Bonus comic! Griff arrives home, Lar is playing with Striped Tooth, (ShereKong's Gruslen) on the couch</i></p>

<p class="ts"><b>Griff:</b> Hello? I'm back.</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Lar_Sunny:</b> INTRUDER!!!</p>

<p><i>Lar_Sunny throws a very surprised StripedTooth at Griff's face, claws out.</i></p>

<h4>Extras</h4>
<p>This was going to be two different comics, but I wanted to finish the arc before September and didn't want to have to do the setup all over again that Lar doesn't know to expect Griff to be changing species.</p>
<p>I went through all of Jellyneo's item database looking for furniture to fit the house. Most of it sits in my SDB because I haven't gotten around to looking up how to make classic neohomes function.</p>

<p class="ts"><b>Lar_Sunny:</b> Flying!?</p>

<p class="ts"><b>Lar:</b> No!</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Griff:</b> There it is.</p>

<p class="ts"><b>Griff:</b> Sorry. I forgot Darigan games can be scary.</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Lar (sticking her tongue out at Griff):</b> WHAT?! I'm NOT scared!</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Griff:</b> Do you want to try one then?</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Lar:</b> What's that one?</p>

<p class="ts"><b>Griff:</b> Dodgeball? That might be a little too much to start with but...</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Lar:</b> O.K. bye! Don't forget me at pickup time!</p>

<p class="ts"><b>Lar (holding a spiked ball):</b> DODGE MY WRATH!</p>

<p><i>A full moon sits in the sky.
<br>The silhouettes of a skeith and buzz are seen walking through the woods in a flashback.</i></p>
<p class="ts"><b>Captain Skardelle:</b> Locals have been reporting pets going missing in the woods.
<br>The latest victims: two hikers last seen in this area.
<br>Keep your eyes open and be ready to move.</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Griff: </b> Aye captain Skardell!</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Snickle_Fritz:</b> Luckily Griff will light things up!</p>

<p><i>Gnearamir, and Griff salute Captain Skardelle. Griff's glowing colour light up the tent behind them.</i></p>

<p><i>Griff keeps careful lookout, his hand ready to draw his sword.
<br>A bush rustles behind him.</i></p>

<p><i>As griff turns to inspect, something swooshes behind his back.</i></p>

<p class="ts"><b>Griff:</b> What was that?</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Gnearamir (in ASL):</b> Don't know.</p>

<p><i>Something unseen rapidly zooms in on Griff.</i></p>

<p class="ts"><b>Griff: </b>Where'd it go? Where'd it go?!?</p>

<p class="ts"><b>Captain Skardelle:</b> It's attracted to the light! Gnearamir, help me throw the tent over him!</p>

<p><i>FWOOM! Skardell and Gnearamir throw the tent over Griff.</i></p>
<p><i>The tent fails to hide the glowing. The light shines through the tent cloacked over Razor_Griff, still up on top of the small tree who's trunk sticks out from the cover.

<br>I haven't forgotten myself like that since I was turned...
<br>I don't know what happened...</p>

<p><i>tree_bite, a red halloween Buzz, a little bigger than Razor_Griff's paws, hovers by his hospital bed as Griff's friends crowd him.</i></p>

<p class="ts"><b>Snikkle_Fritz:</b> Will you be a werelupe now?</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Skardelle:</b> What did the doc say Griff?</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Gnearamir (in ASL):</b> You OK?</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Razor_Griff:</b> I'm fine, Doc says the bite barely hit blood.
<br> - lupecathropy is more common in lupes, Kyrii, Buzz and Sometimes scorchios.
<br> - She's given me a list of symptoms...
<br> - Beware of chia cravings...
<br> And I might be extra hungry and restless on full moons.
<br> She recommends walks.</p>

<p class="ts"> WAIT! Does this mean we solved the missing hikers case?</p>

<p class="ts"><b>Skardelle:</b> Actually, Tree_Bite here was one of our two missing hikers.</p>

<p></p><p> A size comparison shows that Tree bite isn't even 1/4th the size of a skeith's head</p>

<p class="ts"><b>Tree_Bite:</b> I'm so sorry I caused so much trouble. I was just looking for flowers to teach my still life class.</p>

<p class="ts"><b>Razor_Griff:</b> Wait... like, for teaching art?</p>

		<h4> Transcript</h4>

<p>We all start somewhere...</p>

<p><i>Three Panels, each drawn by a different artist show a clipping from old comics from NT 141 (a lupe and a kougra watching Blugthak), NT 291 (an eyrie looks up at a parrot) and NT 369 (A xweetox sitting), are greyed out.</i></p>

		
<p> Over the Times we've changed and grown </p>

<p><i> Three new panels in colour, each from one of the three artists. The Art is vastly improved. In the first, an eyrie, poogle and kougra garden in Darigan Citadel. In the second a draik holds a back a smaller one gone rabid, the room around them destroyed in the chaos. In the third, an aisha in a beautiful dress summons red flames against a world of greyscale.</i></p>

<p>And made new friends...</p>

<p><i>A party for NT 1000! Cherry from the comic Blossoms, Lar_Sunny from Life Improvised, and Tilbur and Percivole from Draiks are Bad at Math celebrate with party supplies and a white weewoo!</i></p>

<p> But one thing has stayed the same... The wait for the editor's neomail!</p>

<p><i>A draik (Ralvy), were-buzz (tree_bite) and a human (Twillie), press their faces up against the window looking into the NT office. TNT_Stone and Goldfish in a Bowl are trying to work, TNT_Adler is hidden behind a huge stack of boxes labelled "submit". Various Neopian Times paraphernalia litters the office, referencing past editors.</i></p>

<p>After Note Reads: Thank you to all the NT editors over the years who reviewed our work, every author and artist who's kept the NT going, and every NT reader over the years who helped us grow!</p>

	<h4>Extras</h4>
<p> This was a collaboration between myself, <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=Kuroneko_Kitty">Kuroneko_Kitty</a>, and <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=TwillieBlossom">TwillieBlossom</a>.</p>

<p>We each took a small clipping from the first comics we ever had published to do a comparison to what our art looks like now and show how far we've all come! The NT has been a huge part of our growth as artists and story tellers and we wanted to celebrate it's big 1k anniversary!</p> 

<p>It doesn't matter how good your art is when you start. The important thing isn't to do it perfectly, it's do do ANYTHING at all! You'll get better as you go!</p>

<p>Twillie already had a timeline of all the past editors I was able to reference for the last panel in the office to make sure I got everyone! I was around for Snowflake and Droplet, but then didn't start again until Mac's era. So I never got to know all the editors in-between.</p>

<p>The Stripped Grarrl Plushie is a little tribute to the Neopian Times Writers Forum, which was my home online for many years where I met other NT creators and learned from them! We're a certified fan site now! You can find us on the <a href="/community/index.phtml"> Official Community Page</a> under Fan Sites! </p>

<h4>Transcript</h4>

<p><i> Yibit Scarlet, the speckled Zafara, Lar_Sunny, holding an upside-down map of Neopia, and Jane Scarlet, out walking. Yibit is wearing darigan colours and a darigan scarf. Lar is wearing a rainbow sweater.</i></p>
<p class="ts"><b>Lar_Sunny:</b> Thanks for letting me visit for Land Swap Day!</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Yibit:</b> Yay!</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Jane:</b> Neoschool has the weirdest theme days.</p>

<p><i> Passing by Uni's clothing shop, they see the uni shopkeeper is grey, and putting clothes on a rack labbelled "Uni's clothes no one wants</i></p>

<p class="ts"><b>Yibit:</b> Looks like Ellia swapped with GREYLAND!</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Lar_Sunny:</b> Where's Greyland?</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Jane:</b> There's no such thing as Greyland</p>

<p><i>They pass by the beauty parlour, outside, the beauty shop Usul has turned grey, and is standing under a hose, her makeup running. Jane observes, momentarily speechless.</i>

</p><p class="ts"><b>Jane:</b> Lar, Lemme see that map...</p>

<h4>Extras</h4>
<p> Collaboration with <a href="/ntimes/index.phtml?section=search&amp;keywords=june_scarlet">June_Scarlet</a> who does the comic series <a href="/~Yibit09">Dinner with the Scarlets</a> and <a href="/~Ronjono"> Ink.</a> This was for the April Fools Day edition! The idea was all June's and I did a hybrid of our art styles. The shop keeper usul wasn't supposed to be there, but I misread the script and thought Ellia was the beauty shop Usul and that the clothing shop Uni was just called "Uni." Oops. Didn't notice until I'd already drawn everything so she stayed. </p>

<h3>A Taxing Battle</h3>

<p><a href="/ntimes/index.phtml?section=591919&amp;week=1007">Published in NT 1007</a></p>

<h4>Transcript</h4>


<p><i> ShereKong vs Taxbeast!! They bear their claws for battle on a splash screen!</i></p>
<p><i>A screenshot from the battledore shows Sherekong with paper all around his feet from his customization</i></p>

<p class="ts"><b>Taxbeast:</b> Did you... bring your taxes in here with you?</p>
<p class="ts"><b>ShereKong:</b> Please help me! They were due DAYS ago!</p>

<p><i> ShereKong and the Taxbeast sit down together, the paper piled up as they look over them.</i></p>

<p class="ts"><b>ShereKong:</b> Thanks. There's so many new rules and we have a kid now.</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Taxbeast:</b> Oh! You can claim that as a dependent.</p>



<h4>Extras</h4>
<p> This was my first comic idea when I got back to neo after I saw ShereKong in the battledome with all his customization tax papers around his feet. Also one of the reasons I also got back into neopets was because I was avoiding doing my own taxes. It took me over a year to introduce Lar_Sunny to the comics before I could finally work on this comic!</p>
<p>But I don't have access to the tax beast in the battledome. When I asked around for someone who could help with a screenshot, bloodhoundpup was kind enough to provide one for me to edit ShereKong into.</p>

<h3>Distractions</h3>

<p><a href="/ntimes/index.phtml?section=592455&amp;issue=1010">Published in NT 1010</a></p>

<h4>Transcript</h4>


<p><i> A typewriter sits on a desk next to a newspaper that reads "Grey-Demic: Neggs to Eggs" A white gruslen stands behind the typewriter.</i></p>

<p class="ts"><b>Ice_Rocket:</b> Ooooh, new typewriter S.K.?</p>
<p class="ts"><b>ShereKong:</b> Yup! Neovia's latest model!</p>
<p class="ts"><b>Ice_Rocket:</b>Gonna fire it up to cover the Altar Cup?</p>

<p class="ts"><b>ShereKong:</b> I'm not sure... I didn't become a journalist to write about yooyuball... I want to write about things that are important...</p>

<p class="ts"><b>Ice_Rocket:</b> But you love yooyuball!</p>
<p class="ts"><b>ShereKong:</b> Yea but, is it distracting me?</p>

<p><i> ShereKong leafs through the pages of the newspaper, the back reads "Economy Grey?</i></p>

<p class="ts"><b>Ice_Rocket:</b> Why not write both?</p>
<p class="ts"><b>ShereKong:</b> Maybe if some folks helped with chores...</p>

<p class="ts"><b>Ice_Rocket:</b> OH! I just remembered! Your A.C. press release arrived! Ha ha...</p>
<p class="ts"><b>ShereKong (reading the Press Release):</b> WHAT?!</p>

<p><i> ShereKong types wildly:The Altador Cup Comitee has once again show their incompetence. "Inexperience" is not the weakness of a player with over 5 years playing professionally and yet - they continue to list it on profiles long after their rookie years have passed.</i></p>

<p><i>PetPet Day Bonus: The white gruslen sits on the typewriter innocently.</i></p>
<p class="ts"><b>ShereKong:</b> Stripe Tooth, no, please. I need to work...</p>


<h4>Extras</h4>
<p> I Wrote this before we saw this years's player profiles. We'll see if my prediction that the weakness descriptions will remain unchanged come true soon.

<h2>LIFE IMPROVISED</h2>



    <div class="boxw" style="background-color: #e4dbf0; width: 85%; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; float: -blocked-; margin: auto;">
<p> <b>Life Improvised</b> is a comic about four pets who live up on Darigan Citadel. It mixes slice of life and adventure as the small family learns to get along with each other and the world of Neopia.</p>

<p>I first started this series back in middle school, just as the first Darigan vs Meridell war was underway. In university I drifted away from Neopets and eventually stopped playing to focus on other things. In 2022 as my other fandom interest slowed down, and another artist I follow was posting pictures of her pets, I began to miss the old Neopian Times community and drawing my own pets so I retrieved my old account and soon found myself full of ideas!</p>
