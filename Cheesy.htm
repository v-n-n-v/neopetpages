<br><b><font size="4" color="blue"><a id="Howtoplay">How to play the Pet Auction House:</a></font></b><br><font size="2">

List the pet you would like to be put on the Pet Auction House. <br><b>ONLY ONE PET PER USER, PER ROUND CAN BE LISTED</b>. **Exception to this may be if OP decides to allow multiple pets. They will specify in their first post.**<br>The Auctioneer will say when the auction house will open and for how long bidding will be allowed. Usually this time is 30 minutes listing, 30 minutes bidding. Other users will bid their pets on yours. All bids placed on your pet must be tracked by you. <br>
At the end of the auction you must select a bid placed on your pet. <b>If your pet receives only one bid, that is the offer you have to accept!</b>
<br><br><b><i>If you're not able to stay and devote your full attention to the game for the allotted time, please don't post your pet to the auction house or bid on an auctioned pet! </i></b>

<br><br><br><br><br><b><font size="4" color="blue"><a id="variations">Variations of the Game:</a></font></b><br>

There are several variations that have evolved of the Pet Auction House (PAH). Here are the most commonly known ones and a brief explanation of them. <br><br><font color="red"><b>PAH/No Pass PAH</b></font> --- This is the normal standard PAH rules mentioned above. You may not pass if you list as long as you receive eligible bids.
<br><br><font color="red"><b>Free Pass PAH</b></font> --- In this version you may list your pets and at the end of bidding, if you do not like any of your bids, you may pass. <br><br><font color="red"><b>Half and Half PAH</b></font> --- List two pets to be put up for auction. If they both receive bids, you must choose a bid for at least ONE of your auctioned pets. You may then pass for the other pet. If only one receives a bid, you may pass on both.

<br><br><font color="red"><b>Chaos PAH</b></font> --- There is no cap to the pot, no restrictions on what can be listed, no cap on how many pets people may list. Essentially is a regular PAH with less restrictions.

<br><br><font color="red"><b>PAH Extravaganza</b></font> --- This is a special PAH event that is hosted on the 1st of the month when everyone's transfers have reset. Often times, the host will advertise pets that will be listed in the week before the 1st. The Listing and Bidding times will be extended as well. There are typically several rounds hosted throughout the entire day to make sure as many people as possible get to participate. The rounds may be broken up into Pass, no pass, Half and Half, or Chaos PAHs depending on the host's discretion. <br><br><font color="red"><b>3l/4l/RW/RN/MS PAH</b></font> --- These are self explanatory and highly specialized. They will vary from board to board, so read the rules on the first posts carefully. Some may require only RW/RN can be listed or bid, others may offer passes or not. 

<br><br><b>Please note: Hosts may make exclusions or changes to their game boards, so you should always read the first posts of a PAH board CAREFULLY before participating so you understand the rules. The variations listed above are just generalizations of the different kinds of PAH boards that are common at this time.</b>
<br><br><br><br><br><b><font size="4" color="blue"><a id="additionalrules">What Pets Can Be Bid/Auctioned:</a></font></b><br>

---- What can be Auctioned: Vwn Pronounceable pets (10L or Less, can be capped or uncapped), UCs, RWS, RNs, Compounds (XxxxXxxxx or Xxxxxxxxxxxx format), Unpronounceable 2/3/4L pets, 2/3/4C pets, and ANY named BDs. These are the only pets that can be put up for auction.
<br><br>

---- <b>Eligible</b> pets that can be bid: VWN Pronounceable (Xxxxxxxxxx format 10L or less), UC, RW, RN, VWN BDs<br><br>

---- Additional pets that can be bid but DO NOT have to be accepted: Uncapped pronounceable names 10L or less, Compounds (XxxxXxxxx or Xxxxxxxxxxxx format), Unpronounceable 2/3/4L pets, 2/3/4C pets vbn-wn BDs, Young pets below 168 hours old that cannot be pounded.<br><br><br><b><font size="4" color="blue"><a id="things">Additional Rules</a></font></b><br>


---- If you are playing a version of PAH that has no passes, you <i>MUST</i> select a bid made on your auctioned pet. If you get one bid, that is the offer you take (As long as it is an <b>Eligible</b> Bid)<br>
So <b>PLEASE</b> don't put a pet up on the Auction if you're not comfortable with trading for a VWN Basic pet. This game is not meant to get you uptrades, it's meant to get you trades. If you don't want to follow the rules, <b>PLEASE STICK TO BIDDING</b><br><br>

--- Bidding starts at the beginning of the minute to the end of the minute, So if the bidding is from 9:00-9:15, all bids placed up till 9:15:59 <b>WILL COUNT</b>. Bids placed at 9:16 do not count.<br><br>

--- When playing, all listing of pets and offers must be posted on the board. NO NEOMAILS should be happening unless the round has ended and users are mailing to discuss customs/details of a trade. <b>The exception to this rule is if someone that has an auctioned pet or is the winning bid disappears from the board. Please wait until 30 minutes after the round has ended before mailing someone to see if they would still like to abide by the rules of the game and trade.</b><br><br>

--- If you are offering a custom on your auction/bid You MUST specify the CAP of that custom (100k, 1 mil, UL, FFQ, Etc) An unspecified custom DOES NOT COUNT and will not be added onto your listing/bid.
<br><br>
--- THIS IS A GAME I MADE UP therefore us as users cannot force someone to trade with you. However if hosts see someone consistently breaking or bending the rules, they may mail them and ask them not to list anymore on their boards and stick to bidding. If you break the rules on bidding and consistently ghost or bid with no intention of following though, you may be asked not to play anymore.  <b>If you don't like ANY OF THESE RULES, please don't play.</b> There are lots of things to do on neo, the people of the PC enjoy playing these game as they are intended to be played. If you break the rules, it ruins the fun for others.<br><br>
--- Please don't be rude or unkind to anyone playing, even if they misunderstand the game or intentionally break the rules. Make mental note of it, and don't trade with that person in the future? Drama helps no one.<br><br><br><b><font size="4" color="blue"><a id="howtopost">How to List and Bid</a></font></b><br><br>

When playing, all listing of pets and offers must be posted on the board. Please No Neomails!! This will keep it much easier to follow! Use the following formats to participate:
<br><br><font size="4"><b>Listing Format:</b></font>
<br><br>
LISTING: Petname the Pet color and Species <br>(@YourUsername)<br><br><i><font size="1"><b>Example:</b><br> LISTING: Cheesy the Blue Grundo<br> (@space_bar)</font></i>

Try to pick a pet of yours that has a short name to reduce character usage when you post it on boards.<br> If you don't know how to code petpages to look fancy, there's no need to worry! SunnyNeo.com has premade Petpages or <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Spensy">HERE</a> is one of the fanmade pet page coding pages you can copy and use! (Credit to  
<a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=mizitch">Kels</a>) Otherwisee a basic page that clearly displays each listed pet on different lines is just fine as well :)<br><br><b>Make the title of the board overly obnoxious.</b> --- I know it seems really annoying but making sure the board is SEEN is KEY to having a good auction. The more people on the board, the more successful it will be so use BIG and MOVING smilies like *clap* *warf* *violin* to make sure it is seen! Also don't be afraid to use ALL CAPS TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE SEE THE BOARD! Here's a good title that always seems to draw attention you can copy and paste if you don't feel like being creative:<br><br><br><font color="red">*clap* *clap* *clap* (version of PAH) PET AUCTION HOUSE *clap* *clap* *clap*</font><br><br>Make sure you include which version of PAH you will be hosting in the title as well. <br><br><b>Clearly state the rules in the first posts or link to /~Cheesy in your first post.</b> --- Do not automatically assume everyone knows what PAH is or how to play. You need to clearly state how to play or link to this page for newcomers to the game. This is part of your job as host, so make sure it is in THE FIRST POST OF THE BOARD!<br><br>Here is a template you can change as you need it for the first post(s) of your PAH Board:<br><br>
-----------<br><br><font size="4">

Hello and welcome to the Pet Auction house! I will be your host, <font color="red">_______</font>!<br>This is a pet for pet trading game, no items/nps will be included in this auction.<br>Rules: /~Cheesy<br>The Pot: //www.neopets.com/~<font color="red">POTpetNAME</font><br><br>Listing: <font color="red">##:## to ##:##</font><br>Bidding: <font color="red">##:## to ##:##</font><br><br><font color="red">(If you have any additional info or clauses, put them here)</font><br></font>
<br>-----------<br><br><br><b>Pick a Busy time of day.</b> --- Look at the front page of the PC, and take notice of the timestamp tags to the right of all the boards. A good rule of thumb I use is to see how many have had activity in the past minute. If there is over 8 boards who've had a post on them in the last minute, that's usually a good indicator that a decent amount of people are on! This will ensure that those who list get lots of bids, and everyone will leave the game happy.<br><br><b>Don't host if you have to leave soon or you're on mobile</b>. --- It's really hard to host from mobile due to having to track the pot and copy and paste. If it's a fast time of day, you may become overwhelmed with the pot. Also each round should ideally last for 60+ minutes so if you think you'll have to go soon, it may be better to let someone else host.<br><br><b>Make sure you as the host understand the rules well</b> 
 --- When you're OP of a PAH board, you will be asked to make calls on trades (Eg, someone is ghosting someone else, someone won multiple auctions, someone ran out of transfers etc) and if you don't understand the rules for those situations, you may feel ill-equipped to host. Make sure you read the full rules and FAQ section so you can make calls in those moments quickly and without confusion ensuing.<br><br><b>Just have fun!</b> --- This is a fan made and run game to help the PC get back to trading for fun and have a chill place to hang out while doing so. Do not make the board uncomfortable by calling people out publicly or shaming anyone if they don't understand the rules. Douse any torch fires and smack down pitch forks, mail those who make mistakes to explain rules more clearly, and encourage those scared to play to stick to bidding if they're hesitant in any way. As the host, it is your job to make sure things run smoothly and efficiently :) <br><br><br><br><b>

<div class="auto"><h2><a id="General">Personal Pet Auctions (PPA):</a></h2><br><font color="red">*This is just a game, not law. I made this to reduce confusion but everyone can do whatever they would like!*</font><br><br> Personal Pet Auctions are auction boards hosted for <i>One pet</i> that you alone own. It is not affiliated with the PAH, therefore you can make the rules more flexible to your wants and needs.<br><br>However if you're going to call it an Auction, here are some guidelines to help specify it for ACTUALLY being an auction and not just an UFQT board.<br><br><h2><a id="Rules">What MAKES an Auction:</a></h2><br><br>--- <b> Set a Time Limit For Yourself:</b> Whether it's 15 minutes or 2 hours, just give people a time to check back. <br>This is important because just saying "When the board ends" is too ambiguous and boards often last for days or just disappear randomly. Also if you say "I'll decide on Page # PEOPLE WILL BUMP YOUR BOARD TO THAT to force you to choose XD It's not cool! Time limit is much better!<br> When someone makes their PPA last for 5+ hours, it feels really horrible not knowing if you should offer your bid pet on other things, and you are basically in limbo until the auctioner decides to end. <br>Just be courteous and realize others are involved in this auction, not just you! And in saying your Auction is lasting for days is essentially a "considering board" for everyone who bids. Just be courteous and kind to all involved :)<br><br> -- <b> Do NOT Allow Neomails:</b> If you've ever participated in an auction board, when someone picks an offer that WASN'T posted, that the OP received through neomail, or they just plain backed out, it feels like your time was wasted. Keeping it on the board ensures the honor system. It FORCES you to stick to your word and trade at the time you said you would. If that makes you uncomfortable, <i>don't call your board an auction,</i><br><br>-- <b> PLEASE Post Your Decision On Your Board:</b> I mentioned this before, but there are people waiting until the time you specified to know if they won. Please post AND mail the person you chose so everyone else isn't left guessing. It's just kind to do so!!<br><br>-- <b>If you specify you ONLY want these sorts of bids, DO NOT BE A JERK if people offer pets you didn't specify could be bid:</b> People are used to the PAH boards, where ANY VWN pet can be bid on an auction. If you're going to call your board an Auction, don't get upset or be mean to someone for just bidding something that's allowed in a PAH auction. We're creatures of habit, and at the very least it was a free bump for you :)<br><br><br><h2><a id="First">Sample PPA First Post</a></h2><br>Here is a sample first post you are welcome to copy and paste and replace with your info for your own PPA! This can be altered how you wish, but it may help reduce confusion and increase bids on your pet if you make sure everyone knows what a PPA even is:<br><br><br><font size="4"><b>*This is a PET for PET trading game! No items or NPS will be included in this auction!*<br><br>I am Auctioning my pet Xxxxxx until ##:## NST<br>This means, you will bid your pets on mine, and at the end of the time, I will HAVE to select one of the offers I received!<br><br>

Please Bid in this format:
<br><br>

BIDDING:<br>YourPetsName - Species and Color<br>(@Yourusername)<br><br>
The auction begins now! Good luck to all!!</b></font>

<br><br>That's it! These aren't hard and fast rules, just more to help you ensure your board is a success and that others don't get confused!

<br><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gWUEpuH.gif" height="500" width="500"><br><center><font size="5"><b>Frequently Asked Questions:</b></font><br><br><div class="auto"> <font size="2">
Here are some questions I have been asked about the PAH. Please read through this before mailing me:<br><br></font><font size="5" color="blue">Pet Auction House FAQ:</font><br><br><font color="red" size="2"><b>Q: Can I bid my pet on multiple auctions?</b></font><br>
A: Yes please do. You can bid your pet on as many of the auctions as you would like during bidding phase as long as said pet <b>is NOT being auctioned in that round</b>. If multiple auctions select your bid to win, YOU as the bidder choose which auction you would like to win. Then the other auction(s) you did not select must then pick another eligible bid. <br><br><br><br><font color="red" size="2"><b>Q: If I don't like any of the bids I got on my auctioned pet, can I back out? </b></font><br>
A: Going to put this answer in big letters because it needs to be said loudly:<br><b><font size="4"> If you FOR ANY REASON think you will have regrets trading a pet you put in for a VWN basic pet, DO. NOT. AUCTION IT!</font></b><br>No one can force anyone to trade, and I will not let anyone be bullied in the name of this stupid game I made up. <br>But THIS IS ESSENTIALLY GAMBLING WITH NEOPETS, and if you're going to participate in the game, you are telling the entire PC "I am about to trade this pet for whatever, I really don't care. I'm here to have fun." so don't expect everyone to just be happy if you decide to break the rules and back out. They won't be because they've been playing by the rules and being good sports about it.<br>So here's my honest to goodness advice: If you think for any reason auctioning your pet will cause you to have regrets or feel bad, please for everyone's sake just stick to bidding it or refrain from playing.

<br><br><font color="red" size="2"><b>Q: If I pick a winning bid and for whatever reason they cannot trade with me, do I need to pick another eligible bid on my pet? </b></font><br>
A: Yes. Plain and simple. If they realize the account isn't aged/they're out of transfers/they win another auction they like more than your auction and their bid is withdrawn/they back out: You need to pick a new bid. This is why it makes sense when you're collecting your bids during bidding round to have a TOP 3 of your favorite offers.<br>Keep them to yourself and if your #1 falls through, post your second choice.

<br><br><font color="red" size="2"><b>Q: I saw someone have their friend/family member bid on their auction and they accepted it so they wouldn't have to follow the rules!  </b></font><br>
A: If they actually went through with the trade and you saw the pet be transferred, then there's absolutely nothing wrong with this. We're a small community and sometimes friends trade with friends/family.<br>But. That being said. If they are repeatedly doing this, accepting their friends/family's bids, and NOT actually trading (The pets involved don't move accounts at all and no transfers are used) this is really slimy and not ok. It makes no sense either, if they're afraid to auction they should just stick to bidding.<br>If this happens, please don't publicly shame them or call them out by name on a board. Just mail the host of the PAH, let them know the situation, and hopefully they will contact them and let them know it's not ok unless they're ACTUALLY following through and trading and perhaps they should stick to bidding. Since we're all adults here, usually that's all that's needed to remedy the situation.


<br><br><font color="red" size="2"><b>Q: Can I Auction a FFQ/Custom? </b></font><br>
A: Yes. You need to specify WHAT cap the custom is though (100k, 400k, 1 mil, UL, FFQ, CC, PP) and state that it is <b>On a pound pet or untaken name</b>. Let me just be blunt with you though, Customs don't normally get many bids unless they are FFQ or Unlimited nowadays. So if you don't want to lose 2 mil and end up with a VWN basic pet, I wouldn't suggest auctioning a custom! But if you just wanna make someone's dreampet, by all means auction whatever amount you want. <br><br><font color="red"><b>Q: How do I bid on a custom/FFQ? </b></font><br>
A: You will need to bid like this:<br><br>BIDDING on CustomAmountHere:<br>YourPetsName - Color and species (For a Royal custom)
<br>YourPetsName - Color and species (For a Royal custom)
<br>YourPetsName - Color and species (For a Royal custom)
(@Your_username) <br><br><font color="red" size="2"><b>Q: Can I host a PAH board?</b></font><br>
A: Yes of course, anyone can!! <b>Just link back to the rules on <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Cheesy">Cheesy's page</a> to avoid any confusion!</b> And please make sure you've read the <a href="#howtohost">How Host a PAH Board</a> section of this page!  <br><br><br><font color="red" size="2"><b>Q: USERNAME Backed out of a trade/Ignored my bids/pretended they didn't understand the rules. Can they be banned from playing? </b></font><br>
A: First of all, the best way to handle this is to not make a public shaming board about it or call someone out on the PAH board. Doing those things can lead to you being reported for harassment. You can mail the host of the board privately to bring it to their attention. <br>Secondly, make sure all your bids were eligible and had to be accepted <a href="//www.neopets.com/~cheesy#additionalrules"> as per the rules of the game.</a><br> Also, was your bid for next month? Because they do not have to accept if you are out of transfers.<br>Some hosts may decide to mail the person and explain the situation if your bids were eligible and they are ignoring or declining them. This game has a lot of rules and often times people will not understand those when they play.<br>If someone consistently breaks the rules and will not listen to reason, regular hosts of PAH boards may mail them and request they no longer participate in their boards or stick to just bidding if they're consistently backing out from regretting auctioning pets. Usually just talking it over in private resolves the issue and we can all go on with our lives.<br><b>Remember:</b> This is a game I made up. It is not law. By participating they are insinuating they will follow the rules, but people back out sometimes and no one, not even the Host can't force them to trade with you. We're adults though, so let's try to handle ourselves that way and not get upset if someone does this.<br>On the flip side, please don't participate if you are even the LEAST bit scared to trade a pet you love for a VWN basic. This game isn't meant to help you uptrade, it's just meant to help you trade. <br><br><br><br>Thank you for taking time to read this, and if your question wasn't answered here please feel free to <a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=space_bar"> mail me</a> and I'll do my best to answer!!
