You will find all you need to know here about the new Faerie Abilities for The Battledome. This guide was created the day Faerie Abilities were re-introduced to the site and <b>we were the first</b> to begin testing &amp; gather this information. Let me just say <b>thank you</b> to the select few users from The Battledome Chat who spent their <i>time, money and effort</i> helping to gather the initial information together. It would have never happened if it were not for <b>everyone</b> involved. This entire page has had a complete makeover so it is now easier to navigate and view. The <i>navigation</i> is on the left portion of the page. The first section has general information and in-depth guides about the <i>new ability system, new faerie bottles</i>, etc. You will then see the faerie abilities portion separated into each <b>Tier Level</b> so you can navigate to where you would like. If a portion of this page is cut off, zoom out (Control -) until you see the entire page. If you have any <i>questions, concerns or comments</i>, please feel free to <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=_mariokart_&amp;subject=Faerie+Abilities">neomail me</a>, thank you &amp; enjoy! 
<p>
<b><font color="d90303">Please Remember</font></b>: This guide took many testers to find out this information and I wrote all of the guides &amp; general information you see here myself.

</p><h1>Updates</h1>
<b>December 17, 2016</b>: <br>
•  Unfortunately there are no updates to report as nothing has been changed to Faerie Abilities or The Battledome...yet. Just want to update this to let everyone know this page is not forgotten about and once the Neopets Team brings updates, I will update this page.
<p>
<b>February 12, 2015</b>: <br>
•  Thank you <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=formosoft">formosoft</a> for offering to revamp the entire layout of this page! 
</p><p>
• Please know that I am still willing to update information on this page; however, many abilities seems to slightly change for a period of time or act up. Until The Neopets Team confirms any intended changes, I will not alter what these abilities do. At the time of writing this, they have not intentionally changed faerie abilities in a long time. 
</p>
<hr><a name="history"></a>
<h1>History</h1>
<p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/template_images/faerie_bottle_escape.gif" width="50" height="50">Many, many years ago, when The Battledome was first created, Faeries granted well trained pets certain abilities (depending on how advanced they were) and they became quite popular to use. As the years continued, it became mandatory to have certain abilities in order to aid in winning battledome challenges. These <a href="/abilities.phtml">older abilities</a> were unchanged for many years; however, until The Battledome was removed from Neopia.
<br><br>
When The New Battledome was introduced to Neopia at the end of 2012 and beginning of 2013, it was only appropriate for the Faeries to do their part as well and re-vamp their abilities. Over the many years of training, pets have far surpassed their useful abilities and it was only right to challenge everyone once again.
<br><br>
When the New Faerie Abilities were introduced, everyone was hectic, had tons of questions and was unsure of many things. Word spread quickly and even Neopians who were gone for a while returned. In order to help make everything clear and understandable, I created a little chart (<a href="#Meet">click here</a> to view or click "Meet the Faerie" on the navigation bar) to help guide you. 
<br><br></p>
<h2>Fading Bottled Faeries</h2>
<center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bottlefaerie_air.gif" width="50" height="50" title="Fading Bottled Air Faerie"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bottlefaerie_dark.gif" width="50" height="50" title="Fading Bottled Dark Faerie"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bottlefaerie_earth.gif" width="50" height="50" title="Fading Bottled Earth Faerie"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bottlefaerie_fire.gif" width="50" height="50" title="Fading Bottled Fire Faerie"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bottlefaerie_light.gif" width="50" height="50" title="Fading Bottled Light Faerie"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bottlefaerie_water.gif" width="50" height="50" title="Fading Bottled Water Faerie"></center>
<p>
These were around Neopia for over a decade until recently when they became retired and power fading. Their previous abilities were not very strong except for a small few which were used. With the recent changes, these bottles can no longer grant blessings for your pet; however, you are able to combine these bottles to create a <i>Weak Bottled Faerie</i> at random. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Weak Bottled Faeries</h2>
<center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_botfae1_air.gif" width="50" height="50" title="Weak Bottled Air Faerie"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_botfae1_dark.gif" width="50" height="50" title="Weak Bottled Dark Faerie"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_botfae1_earth.gif" width="50" height="50" title="Weak Bottled Earth Faerie"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_botfae1_fire.gif" width="50" height="50" title="Weak Bottled Fire Faerie"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_botfae1_light.gif" width="50" height="50" title="Weak Bottled Light Faerie"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_botfae1_water.gif" width="50" height="50" title="Weak Bottled Water Faerie"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_botfae1_meta.gif" width="50" height="50" title="Unidentified Weak Bottled Faerie"></center>
<p>
These are the first new faerie bottles introduced to us for training purposes. These weak bottles will grant 1-2 blessings for the appropriate family. The unidentified bottle will grant 1-2 blessings from random faeries. These can be directly used on your pet via your inventory. Once you bless your pet, the faerie bottle will be removed from your inventory since they are one use item (like the previous bottles). 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>How to Train</h2>
<p>
Training abilities requires your pet to have blessings from the faeries. These blessings can be obtained from Bottled Faeries. As stated above, the fading bottles <i>no longer directly</i> bless your pet, but you can combine them to create a weak bottled faerie. In order to do that, you must visit the <a href="/island/cookingpot.phtml">cooking pot</a> and mix three <b>different</b> Fading Bottled Faeries together. Here is an example:
<br><br></p>
<center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bottlefaerie_light.gif" width="50" height="50"> + <img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bottlefaerie_air.gif" width="50" height="50"> + <img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bottlefaerie_fire.gif" width="50" height="50"> = <img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_botfae1_dark.gif" width="50" height="50"><br><br></center>
<p>
Just remember that it does not matter which three faeries you pick, as long as they are different. There are no combinations to creating a certain Weak Bottled Faerie as <b>the result from the cooking pot is random</b>. There are also other methods of obtaining bottled faeries:</p>
<p>
• Restock at the <a href="/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=2">Magic Shop</a> and <a href="/halloween/garage.phtml">Abandoned Attic</a><br>
• Randomly awarded by defeating opponents in The Battledome<br>
• Win them from the <a href="/faerieland/wheel.phtml">Wheel of Excitement</a><br>
• Randomly obtain from the <a href="/worlds/geraptiku/tomb.phtml">Deserted Tomb</a><br>
• Win them from <a href="/island/tombola.phtml">Tombola</a><br>
• Randomly rewarded for completing <a href="/winter/snowfaerie.phtml">Snow Faerie Quests</a>.<br>
(<a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=_mariokart_">Neomail me</a> if you know of other ways to obtain them)

</p>
<p>
Once you have any newer bottled faeries in you possession, you can simply go to your inventory, click on the bottle, and "bless" the pet you want to train. <b>Blessings are pet specific, not account specific</b>. This means if you want two of your pets to have many abilities, you will have to pay individually for each one. If you do plan to transfer your pets in the future, do not worry about faerie blessings. Any abilities and unused blessings will be transfered with your pet.</p>
<h2>Purchasing Abilities</h2>
<p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/template_images/fire_faerie_fly.gif" width="50" height="50"> After blessing your pet, you are able to view your current blessings <a href="/dome/abilities.phtml">here</a>. It will show you on the top right the amount of blessings for each faerie you currently possess. You will also see all of the abilities listed below broken down into ten Tier Levels. Each ability has an image with at least one or more icons next to it and a number. This states what it will cost you (in blessings) to obtain that ability. For example, in Tier Level 25 the ability Sear would cost ten fire blessings to learn. 
</p>
<p>
Please know that you are able to freely train between tiers as you do not need to start with Level 1 and move up. Another important factor to know is that you are only able to actively have one of the three abilities per tier. If you wish to switch within the tier, you will be required to pay <b>half</b> the original blessing amount (If you paid 10 blessings the first time, it will cost 5 blessings to switch). It will not go lower than this initial discount so try not to switch too much. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Save Money</b>: Remember that once you learn an ability in a Tier, all of the others will decrease in blessing requirements. This can come in handy since certain bottled faeries may be more expensive than others. You may want to learn a cheaper ability first (within the tier), and then learn the ability you want to keep for half the blessing price.
</p>
<p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><b>How do I bless my pet?</b><br>
There are a variety of methods to obtain these bottled faeries. Please read up on "The Basics" portion of this guide for an In-Depth look at that information. 
</p>
<p>
<b>What happened to our old abilities?</b><br>
They are no longer active or useful. You are unable to use them in the new battledome nor do they transfer over to help with the new abilities - You must start new.</p>
<p>
<b>Do Faerie Blessings Disappear?</b><br>
Yes they do - Any blessings required for an ability learned will be removed from the total amount that you have.
</p>
<p>
<b>Do Faerie Abilities Disappear?</b><br>
They do not disappear unless you decide to change out an ability in your Tier. If you currently have Bandage activated and switch to Shade, you will lose your Bandage ability. You will be able to activate Bandage again but you have to pay. The price will be half what you originally paid though. 
</p>
<p>
<b>What happens to my abilities if I met the level requirement but then fall below?</b><br>
You will still own the ability (since you paid for it), but you can no longer use it. Once you get back up to that level, it'll be available for use again.
</p>
<p>
<b>Can I use all abilities or just a certain amount?</b><br>
You are able to use one ability from each Level Tier (1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500) at a time in battle (which gives you a total of ten different abilities to use at max level). You cannot have two abilities from the same Tier activated.
</p>
<p>
<b>Do I have to start training abilities from the beginning?</b><br>
You are able to freely train around all Tiers (as long as your pet has the required level). You do not have to start with Level 1 - You can learn Level 100 first, go down to Level 25 next and follow up with Level 200 if you wish!
</p>
<p>
<b>Will you be able to keep the abilities forever?</b><br>
You can keep them as long as you wish using them over and over. This changes if you decide to switch to another ability <b>in the same level tier</b>. For example, if you switch from Lens Flare to Throw Pillow, you will have to re-learn Lens Flare with Faerie Blessings. A positive note is that it will cost you half of the amount then the original.
</p>
<p>
<b>Are there any cheaper methods or secrets to obtaining abilities?</b><br>
There are no true secrets to obtain them; however, there is a small method which may help you save a little NP. Remember that once you learn an ability in a Tier, all of the others will decrease in blessing requirements. This can come in handy since certain bottled faeries may be more expensive than others. You may want to learn a cheaper ability first (within the tier), and then learn the ability you want to keep for half the blessing price.

<h1>Faerie Abilities</h1>
<p>
Below are the Faerie Abilities and their power. This page is always being updated with new information and statistics so please come back frequently. Also make sure to check the <a href="#updates">updates section</a> for new information added. Here are a few abbreviations again to remind you what they mean.
</p>
<p>
<b>OPD</b>: Once per Day - You are only able to use the ability once a day (they reset at midnight). In addition, you <i>cannot</i> switch abilities learned after you use it. You may only switch an active OPD ability before you use it for the day. 
<br><b>OPB</b>: Once per Battle - You can only use the ability once in each battle you fight.
<br><b>CD</b>: Cooldown - The ability needs a certain number of rounds to rest before it can be used again. 
<br><b>PC</b>: Pairing Capable - Certain abilities are delayed in dealing damage for one round. After you "activate"/use them in battle, you are able to choose any ability to use the following round. Doing this will allow you to have both abilities take effect. 
<br><b>LPC</b>: Limited Pairing Capable - Other abilities will deal damage for consecutive turns. When this occurs you are able to pair any <i>defensive</i> ability (identical method listed above). If you decide to use an offensive ability for the second round, then it will give your consecutive dealing ability a skip for that round and your second ability will work instead. If you decide to repeat that, then the consecutive ability will go into cool down mode or disable. 

</p>
<p>
Also, each ability will be <b>rated &amp; reviewed</b> so please make sure to read. Abilities are rated from 1 <img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> to 5 <img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> along with an overall review. If you have any questions, please <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=_mariokart_">neomail me</a>, thank you.

In which case you could use Drizzle for Round 1 and then use another constant (IE: An icicle) for Round 2 and you will deal damage from both abilities (Drizzle &amp; Icicle) together!

<p><i>Review</i>: Similar to Bandage except this has a chance of healing again the following round. In order to receive the healing, you must place your move before your opponent does.

<b>Cranky</b>: Deals +5% of Total Damage (OPB)<br><i>You wield your weapons with a bit more force while perturbed. </i>

<i>Review</i>: Being able to heal 5% can be helpful if you have a high HP pet or for certain lower league battles. With this being once per battle, it really limits the power. 5% is such a low rate (Ex: You need 2000 HP to heal 100 HP). Overall, this may be your best option to have in this tier as none of them are extremely useful. It never hurts to have a spare healing ability though.

<i>Review</i>: This ability is like a mini third constant. Being able to use your weapons with an additional 6 icons may be the push you need to defeat your opponent (especially water icons).

<p><i>Review</i>: Being able to deal four fire icons (one of the hardest to block) for round one is okay. Where this shines is being limited pairing capable!

<p><i>Review</i>: Having the ability to deal eight extra dark icons is beneficial but not as much with a 10 round cool down rate. There is a spot for this to be helpful though. As long as you dont expect or need this constantly, surprising your opponent with eight dark icons (especially if you dont have dark in your set) can really give you an edge. This is certainly not the worst ability; however, make sure you have at least one "mini-constant" ability that is multi-use. This works identical to "Drizzle" with using an additional ability for the second round. 
</p>
<i>Special Note</i>: Damage is dealt on the second round instead of the round you use it. It is important to mention that this ability is currently not dealing out the damager per icon as it should. Once this is fixed, I will update this information.

Of course it could fail if they dont use one; however, with so many useful abilities, chances are they will.

<p><i>Review</i>: Considering the variety of other abilities available, this is one of the worst. Its a shame because I think it sounds powerful and strong to use. This is another once per day ability and its not even 100% chance to freeze. Dont give this a second thought as it is not worth your time.

<b>Warlock's Rage</b>: Disables your opponents weapons &amp; abilities (OPB). <br><i>Channel your malevolent rage into increased damage and incapacitate your opponent at the same time. A favourite combo of warlocks everywhere. </i><p>
<i>Review</i>: This is identical to the ability "Lens Flare" and most are confused as to why there would be two identical abilities...but it currently looks that way. With that in mind, this is the best ability in this tier without question. Use this before or after Lens Flare in battle and you will have two consecutive rounds of avoiding damage. 
</p>
<i>Special Note</i>: When opponent uses a OPB weapon into a Warlock's Rage (IE: Ghostkerbomb), the weapon is not consumed and they will be able to use it later in the fight.

<p>
<i>Review</i>: One of the requirements to do really well in battle is a full healer. This ability is extremely helpful to those who may not be able to afford a LEV or Jade SS; however, there are a few aspects regarding this ability which you need to know. In order for this to fully heal, you must be over 5% HP, you must be attacked on the round you use it &amp; Lens Flare/Warlocks Rage cannot be used against you since they will stop this from being used (and you will be unable to try again the rest of the battle). While this is certainly nice to have as a backup, I would still strongly recommend having a full healing item which is more dependable. </p>
<p>
<i>Special Note</i>: Since the list is so long and can be complicated, here are some bullet points of what you need to know: <br>
• You must have over 5% of your maximum HP to receive the full heal.<br>
• You must receive damage the same round you use Rejuvenate to receive the full heal.<br>
• Lens Flare/Warlocks Rage type abilities will disable Rejuvenate and you will lose the chance to use it for the battle.<br>
• Do <b>not</b> use this ability the round after a Lens Flare/Warlocks Rage ability is used as you will not receive any healing (although it may say you did).

<p>
<i>Review</i>: This is certainly a helpful ability to be able to drain and heal together. This has its obvious benefits; however, with being used once per battle, having a 100 HP cap, and being in the same tier as Rejuvenate, hard to pick this one to keep active. If you do not wish you have rejuvenate for a particular reason though, this is the second best option. 
</p>

<b>Reflect</b>: Reflects 67% of damage received back at opponent (OPB)<br><i>Politely decline your opponents generous gifts. They can keep 'em. </i>
<p><i>Review</i>: This is certainly the best ability in this tier if you are lucky to achieve this high level. Being able to reflect 2/3's of your opponents damage back at them is quite strong (especially when you add two offensive items). Also keep in mind that it is <b>extremely</b> rare to come across weapons that block reflected icons. This is also extremely helpful when battling those highly powerful 1-player opponents.

<p>
<i>Review</i>: There is certainly a use for this ability if used correctly. Considering Fire is currently the hardest icon to block, this may come in handy. Being able to do three consecutive turns of fire damage can be what you need to defeat your opponent.

<i>Review</i>: Overall this is probably the best of the three abilities to have available (depending on your set). Technically all three of these abilities are identical with the exception of icon types. Earth and Dark icons are both very popular and easy within various leagues. Fire is your best option to avoid being blocked/reflected. Although if you happen to use weapons with heavy fire icons, one of the other abilities may work best to have variety.
