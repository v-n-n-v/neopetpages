<font size="6"><b>Top Cup Players Afflicted By Grey Curse</b></font></p><p>

<b>ALTADOR</b> | A mysterious Grey Curse has been spreading across the planet, from  Kari the Negg Faerie to even inanimate objects like Coltzan's Shrine, notable Neopians have been gradually losing their pep and colour. 
</p><p>
With the next Altador Cup tournament fast approaching, attention is turning towards officials and players of the tournament. The Very VERY Stale Bread can reveal it looks like the players are not immune to this curse. In a joint press conference, the members of Team Lost Desert and Team Darigan Citadel addressed the gathered press, as two of their members had lost their colour.
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/oWkhWT4.png" width="505"></p><p>
Sitting side by side on the panel, Team Lost Desert's star forward and beard advocate Vonde Cayle and Team Darigan Citadel's fan favourite and part-time model Tandrak Shaye were seen to be less vibrant than usual.
</p><p>We have no plans on replacing him. Cayle is just not himself, and he can't help that," Lost Desert Captain Leera Heggle told the gathered press in attempt to alleviate concerns, "I will admit that usually you can't keep Cayle away from having a few Yooyus in his sling, in fact, he's always been able to take more than one at a time in practice. But now…" Heggle seemed to catch himself and changed his tone, "But now, there's still nothing to worry about. Cayle is still an aggressive and energetic player. He has become especially good at his ramming technique. We are making sure he's always on top of his game, even with his terrible curse."
</p><p><a href="//www.neopets.com/space/warehouse/prizecodes.phtml"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tQ6Ph8N.png"></a></p><p>Team Darigan Citadel fans also have nothing to worry about!" Darigan captain Layton Vickles seconded, "Shaye and the team have been working hard to adapt around Shaye's new play style. You will find he is much better at receiving the Yooyu than throwing now, but once he has that Yooyu, he won't be giving it up that easily."
</p><p>
Attention then turned to Cayle and Shaye to find out exactly how this happened.
</p><p>Well, uh, I was just out for a stroll in Faerieland last Saturday, minding my own business, doing nothing out of the ordinary at all, and certainly not in a hidden location." Cayle said.
</p><p>I was also in Faerieland… Doing some clothes shopping… for an upcoming gig…" Shaye joined in vaguely.
</p><p>
When asked if they saw each other, the two hesitated before Shaye interjected "Ah, yes. I walked past Cayle enjoying <i>Faerie Toast With Butter</i> and a <i>House Blend with Cream</i> at a local café. I didn't stop by to say hello because I think brunch is a scam."
</p><p>Wait, wasn't the monthly organic rutabaga and gourd yield in Faerieland last Saturday?" chimed in a frankly nondescript tall and slender purple chia who happened to be walking past.
</p><p>
The press conference was then quickly shut down. </p><p>

<font size="6"><b>Altador Council Member Breaks Silence</b></font></p><p>
<b>SECRET LOCATION </b>|  One of Altador's Twelve Heroes has broken her silence over the Altador Cup Committee Corruption Scandal. The renegade 'hero', known by the alias "The Darkest Faerie" or "The Betrayer" after her betrayal of King Altador over 1,000 years ago, as well as her attempt to usurp Queen Fyora, has revealed to The Very VERY Stale Bread she finds the whole ordeal extremely amusing. 

</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ePw4qFJ.png"></p><p>

Agreeing to speak under condition that we do not reveal her location, The Betrayer told The Very VERY Stale Bread she is ecstatic over the political tensions between Altador and Faerieland. 

</p><p>It's too perfect! One can't make this stuff up! Altador and Fyora, butting heads? I can't!" She laughed while trying to hold back her tears of joy, "And the fact that those fraternal oafs and that creepy Korbat are joining Fyora. It's too much. I can't breathe. I can't breathe!"
 
</p><p>After calming down from her laughing fit, The Sleeper revealed a similar corruption scandal occurred 1,000 years ago, and claimed that this was one of the reasons why she revolted against Altador.

</p><p>First thing's first: I didn't do this, but I can appreciate good work when I see it.

</p><p>I remember it like only a few years ago… In fact, since I was trapped in stone, it pretty much was a few years ago for me… Of course the Altador Cup was just a local thing back then, but the Committee was exactly the same. </p>

<p>
<a href="//www.neopets.com/island/tombola.phtml"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JDdgJI3.png" width="505"></a></p>

<p>I first became suspicious when spectating around 1,012 years ago, there were more than a few foul plays and extra goals being counted, and that just kept escalating as the years went by.



</p><p>One year, I… 'misdirected' that avaricious Skeith (How he became a 'hero' is beyond me) for a few hours while I had a look at the books, and noticed some discrepancies. Things didn't add up. I bought this to Altador, and next thing I know, <b>I'M</b> the enemy, rumours were spread about me, and I'm trapped in stone. That's why I needed my revenge. The whole council is corrupt, and I will never forgive them for what they did to me.

</p><p>Let Altador and Fyora fight. I'll be spectating from the sidelines with my popcorn. I can't wait to see how this turns out."
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/F6pqaPN.jpg" width="505"></p><p>

<font size="6"><b>Inept' Altador Cup Committee Botches Ceremony</b></font></p><p>
<b>ALTADOR </b>| In a shocking turn of events, Team Darigan Citadel has come out as the winner of the seventeenth Altador Cup. This comes after the Altador Cup Committee's abrupt decision to choose the winner by drawing names out of a barrel. Meridell, whom had been sitting on top of the leaderboard throughout the round robin and the finals, was drawn in third place.
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EQpcuAP.jpg" width="400"></p><p>
Fans, players, reporters and foreign dignitaries looked on in disbelief as a member of the Altador Cup Committee drew out two other names and declared both do-overs, before finally settling on Team Darigan Citadel as the winner. 

</p><p>The crowd looked on in horror as King Skarl, whom had made a rare foreign visit just to celebrate what appeared to be a lock for Meridell, almost immediately transmogrified from his usual blue colour to a vivid red. His aides cowered in fear as the sound of his incoherent shouting, laced with various sentence enhancers, echoed throughout Altador Colosseum. 
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3oAvLto.png" width="400"></p><p>
</p><p>Following Team Darigan's win, an unusually flummoxed Lord Darigan told the gathered press he was speechless.
</p><p>I have never seen such a blatant display in my life. Even after I revealed I paid them off, they still do this. They're either being deliberately provocative or are amazingly inept.

</p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/ncmall/collectibles/10_10/nc-collectible.jpg"></p><p>Regardless, I can only hope these unethical means on my part have opened that simpleton at Meridell's eyes. For King Altador to let this go unchecked, it's clear that there's something amiss in Altador.

</p><p>Fyora and myself are announcing an emergency summit to discuss the matter.'

<font size="6"><b>Altador Cup Committee Announces Cheating; Darigan, Krawk Island Confirm Corruption</b></font></p><p>
<b>ALTADOR </b>| In a move that echoes years prior, the Altador Cup Committee has once again hinted that some teams have cheated and certain actions will be taken to rectify it. This comes on the heels of a series of suspicious calls made towards the teams of Krawk Island and the Darigan Citadel.
</p><p>
Lord Darigan made a statement to The Very VERY Stale Bread on the subject, countering the Committee's claims, and reigniting the allegations of corruption from the Altador Cup Committee.
</p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/medieval/dariganschambers.gif"></p><p>Some may find our methods questionable or immoral,' Lord Darigan decreed, 'However, when Fyora made the allegations of corruption from the Altador Cup Committee, we had to see for ourselves. Although we trusted her judgment, the claim had to be verified.
</p><p>The Committee did indeed approach us with a deal: We pay them a smaller sum of money than what they would usually take for a place on the podium. In exchange for this reduced rate, we would publicly decry the allegations and back their claims. It was the perfect opportunity.
</p><p>The Altador Cup Committee made the fatal mistake of coming to us with this deal. Unlike them, we cannot be brought off. We have verified her claims, and we back Fyora and Faerieland completely.'
</p><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/2V8yk2d.png"></p><p>
Krawk Island's Governor McGill also made a statement, however, he claims he was just bored.
</p><p>Aye, they approached me, it's true!' McGill said, 'But I had no other motives other than boredom. I thought I'd make things interestin'. Stir the pot 'n unleash the kraken. 
</p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/themes/028_kri_306cb/rotations/7.png"></p><p>Krawk Island does nah wants t' be involved in a conflict. I didn' know about Darigan's deal, but it's pure hilarity. It's about t' get interestin'.'
</p><p>
Meridell's King Skarl has once again denied any knowledge of bribes, and insists this year Meridell is just in its prime. 
</p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/games/betterthanyou/contestant395.gif"></p><p>Ah tellt ye ah didnae tak' ony braib.' King Skarl said, 'Altador is a guid jimmy. Sin 'is land cam back, 'e 'aes bin hee haw bit 'n ally.
</p><p>We ur indebted tae him, 'n' 'spesh'ly Psellia, fur dair a hawn in th' wars wi' Darigan. In fact, efter she rescued Jeran, she [illegible] 'is tail, then [illegible] 'n' an apple fell oan 'er heid!'
</p><p>
King Skarl laughed hardily, then summoned a servant with a wave of his hand, who presented our reporter with an Erisim dressed as the Meridell Regnant and ushered him out of the castle. </p><p>

<font size="2"><b>KIKO LAKE </b>| The Kiko Lake team member who blew the whistle on the Altador Cup Committee's extortion of the Kiko Lake squad has broken his silence and revealed his identity in an effort to make the Altador Cup Committee accountable for their actions. 
<p>
Former goalkeeper-turned-defender Ditan Colb was replaced by newcomer Lili Lever after an investigation by Kiko Lake team management revealed him as the whistleblower, in what can only be described as a witch-hunt brought on by pressure from the corrupt Cup Committee.

At least I still got my Saucy Splykes! Yooo! You know about them!? They're like these pictures of Splykes… that you pay a bunch of NP for and they like… increase in value the more-"
</p><p>

Our reporter for The Very VERY Stale Bread then thanked Colb for his time and excused herself due to feeling lightheaded.

<font size="6"><b>Hagan Accuses Altador of Trying to Stoke Tensions Between Meridell and Brightvale (We Think)</b></font></p>
<p>

<font size="2"><b>ALTADOR </b>| As the first week of the seventeenth Altador Cup comes to an end, three teams have raced to the head of the pack, yet two teams are attracting all the attention. Meridell and Brightvale have been attaining scores that most people are finding suspicious. 
<p>
Last year, King Hagan called out the Altador Cup Committee for their corruption, backed by the surprising confessions from an anonymous whistleblower from Team Kiko Lake (who has since been replaced) and Queen Fyora of Faerieland that revealed the Altador Cup Committee had sought bribes from both teams in the past in order to secure the title.</p><p>

Now this year, King Hagan suspects the Altador Cup Committee is artificially inflating Brightvale's scores, and has approached his brother, King Skarl of Meridell with the same deal they approached Lost Desert with last year.</p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/ncmall/collectibles/11_05/nc-collectible.jpg"></p><p>The inconversant mountebanks of the Altador Cup Committee are either sonorously amnemonic," King Hagan announced, "or premeditatively endeavouring to foment a temperament of acrimony between my asanine kin and myself.</p><p>With the burgeoning anathema contra patria, Altador has wantonly promulgated an ukase to his Committee to dragoon Brightvale into acquiescence. </p><p>Brightvale will not requiesce into reticence; a fact Altador must diagnosticate! This chicanery will not remain without residuum.</p><p>

<a href="//www.neopets.com/games/nq2/index.phtml"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KfvceKI.png" width="400" height="400"></a></p><p>

King Skarl has downplayed the allegations that Altador has approached him with a bribe (we think).</p><p>Mah Ken it a' bro'er is stowed oot o' jobby.' Skarl told The Very VERY Stale Bread, ' 'e haes read tae mony box 'n' is seein' tings dat a'nae dare. </p><p>

<font size="6"><b> More Trouble For Altador Cup Committee After Nefarious Virtupets Scheme Uncovered </b></font></p>
<p>
<font size="2"><b>ALTADOR</b> | The Altador Cup Committee has been rocked by a series of scandals over the weekend. The Very VERY Stale Bread has been unable to keep up with the rapid developments of the weekend past, but we will endeavour to cover it as best we can. <p>
The first major controversy came in a leaked Virtupets Inc. whitepaper outlining a detailed yet vague plan for a digital 'Virtupets Cup' that will run parallel to the Altador Cup, which will integrate VPTs into the ludic component, and will focus on a 'play-to-earn' economy. </p><p>
The leaked paper prompted a boycott of the exhibition Yooyuball matches which were due to be held across Neopia this weekend, after four teams—Faerieland, Brightvale, Darigan Citadel, Kreludor—announced their withdrawal from the matches in protest. Team Virtupets did not join in the boycott; however, their match was forfeited after Right Defender Weldar Xupenfarb refused to play and is expected to be reprimanded by Team Captain Keetra Deile for his insubordination.</p><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/wN952Op.png"></p><p>
Seemingly as a response to the boycott, crudely made posters promoting VPTs, featuring a picture of Xupenfarb from the period he was enslaved by Dr Sloth, were plastered across Altador, prompting massive outrage throughout the Neopian community. In response, Shenkuu and Lost Desert announced they would unanimously boycott their exhibition match at Altador Colosseum, which was scheduled for Sunday evening. </p><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/F3k05my.png"></p><p>The level of malice it takes to do something like this is despicable!' Shenkuu Team Captain Mirsha Grelinek told The Very VERY Stale Bread, 'I just cannot fathom why someone would even think that this is appropriate. </p><p>Before our scheduled match, I spoke to Leera Heggle, and we agreed to join the boycott. With Larcy's family being enslaved by Dr Sloth in the past, and the Lost Desert being target of a Virtupets invasion, we agreed it we could not in good conscience play and give the Altador Cup Committee any income from our hard work.</p><p>
Once again, instead of hosting a press conference, The Altador Cup Committee instead marched out, hammered a scroll to the door to the Committee Building, insulted the gathered press, and slammed the door in our faces. Once again, the scroll did not really answer anything.</p><p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/hMA23uN.png"></p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/QM7D89Q.jpg"></p></font>

<p>
<font size="2"><b>ALTADOR</b> | The Altador Cup Committee is once again in hot water over its most recent decision to sell Altador Cup Virtupets Tokens (VPTs), after it was revealed a higher up in the Virtupets company made disparaging remarks about the Altador Cup's Grundo players in a board meeting earlier this week. <p>
The remarks, which are too unsavoury to repeat here, caused widespread outrage across Neopia, and many are questioning the whether the economic benefits are worth the PR fall out. </p><p>I'm purely a numbers Krawk, yer see, so at first I thought it would be good for the Altadorian economy,' Krawk Island's Governor McGill told The Very VERY Stale Bread, 'Considerin' the sanctions imposed on Altador by Faerieland and the Medieval Kingdoms [Brightvale and Darigan Citadel]— I know Altador has sent out Siyana and Psellia to try to smooth things over in the respective areas — So I thought it was understandable that the would be trying to revitalise their economy, ye know?' </p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/themes/028_kri_306cb/rotations/1.png"></p><p>I think if I were tryin' to recoup losses, maybe I'd do the same… Though upon hearin' those comments made by that Virtupets Board Member, I tell yer, if I were King Altador, I'd be reconsiderin' my affiliation with Virtupets Inc.</p><p>
While the Altadorian Council has remained largely silent on this issue, the Altador Cup Committee held a press conference to address the issue. </p><p>Look, we don't have any control over what Virtupets does. We're sorry if you got offended, but it's not our fault if you're offended,' the Altador Cup Committee said, 'We've expressed our position with this latest issue with Virtupets, and we can assure you, the board member who made these comments, Professor Knarf Htols, has been dismissed from working on this project. </p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/altador/altadorcup/2010/join-bg.jpg"></p><p>We are pleased to announce that instead Ms Francis McSlothen, who we're told comes from some place far away and has no history with Grundos whatsoever, will be taking his place on the board.</p><p>

However, many players of the Altador Cup have expressed their displeasure in the Altador Cup Committee's move. 'This is absolutely outrageous!' said Team Kreludor captain Derlyn Fonnet, 'VPTs directly contribute to the reinvasion campaign of Dr Sloth, and it's not even a secret!</p><p> 
<img src="//images.neopets.com/altador/altadorcup/news/fonnet.gif"></p><p>
</p><p>Kreludor has suffered more than most at the hands of Dr Sloth, and it is frankly short sighted and insensitive. I have two very distressed Grundos on my team threatening to boycott the entire event because of it, and honestly, I'm thinking of joining them.' </p><p>
This sentiment was echoed by Team Virtupets itself. 'Does the Altador Cup Committee even know what horrors I went through after Dr Sloth enslaved me and my entire family?!' Virtupets Right Defender Weldar Xupenfarb said, 'This is utterly offensive. Words cannot even begin to describe how angry I am. See: Look at my face, I'm so angry!!!</p><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/5S8k7j0.png"></p><p>
 Many Altador Cup fans have also expressed their displeasure in the Committee's decision. 'The Altador Cup has become less about the sport, less about creating a good experience for their core fans.' Techo Superfan said, 'Rather than focusing on fixing the many, many problems that plague the cup each and every year, they're just trying to milk the cup for every cent it's worth.</p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/351_techo_fan.gif"></p><p>
Adding to the chicanery, the Altador Cup Committee has been seen advocating a collaboration with Saucy Splykes, a questionable VPT depicting pictures of Splykes covered in sauce which fans say should not be associated with the Altador Cup due it being questionable. </p><p>
This controversy comes on the heels of the alleged bribery scandal revealed by King Hagan and Queen Fyora. When asked for a comment on the VPT controversy, a spokesperson for the Altador Cup Committee directed The Very VERY Stale Bread and other reporters gathered outside the Committee building to a FAQ they just posted on the door that didn't really answer anything, then slammed the door in our faces.

<font size="6"><b> Altador Cup Committee Investigates Themselves; Finds No Wrongdoing </b></font></p>
<p>
<font size="2"><b>ALTADOR</b> | The Altador Cup Committee has revealed they conducted a formal internal investigation into the Committee in the wake of allegations of bribery and corruption made by Queen Fyora last week, and have announced they have found they are completely innocent. <p>
This comes after a rare event of solidarity in which the Kingdoms of Brightvale, and Darigan Citadel both backed Queen Fyora's claims, and called for King Altador and the Council to intervene. </p><p>We understand there have been allegations of foul play directed at the Committee,' a spokesperson for the Altador Cup Committee said, 'We have launched an independent <font size="1">from outside reviewers</font> internal investigation and have definitively concluded that we are not corrupt.</p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/events/altcup6_signup.gif"></p><p>You should just accept that now Altador are the champions of the cup, as it should be. It's what we deserve after all these years.</p><p>Faerieland are cheaters and always will be, and so are Lost Desert. So...' The representative of the Altador Cup Committee then blew a raspberry and walked off in such a fashion that at least one member of the gathered press fainted in shock.</p><p>This so called <i>investigation</i> by the Altador Cup Committee is utter tripe!' Lord Darigan announced in a rare public appearance before being interrupted by a distant 'chicanery' echoing from somewhere below the floating citadel.</p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/medieval/dariganschambers.gif"></p><p>Of course, they're going to say they're not corrupt; only an idiot would believe them,' Lord Darigan continued, 'I have no reason to believe Queen Fyora would make such a serious allegation without substantial proof.</p><p>The Altador Cup Committee should be independently investigated <b>by an external source</b>.</p><p>I know too well the effects greed can have on a kingdom. I pray that Altador corrects this before it is too late.</p><p>
While the Kingdoms of the Lost Desert have remained silent on the issue, a source close to Qasalan Royal Family unveiled some insider information. 'I overheard the King saying that that old coot must be senile if he doesn't see what's happening under his nose,' the source revealed to The Very VERY Stale Bread. </p><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/RndqPU7.jpg"></p><p>I do find it a bit suspicious that Lost Desert are being scapegoated in a way like Queen Fyora described, only to make way for Altador to take home the cup. </p><p>It's almost as if the Altador Cup Committee planned this from the get-go. It's a little <i>too</i> coincidental for our liking.</p><p>

<p>
<font size="2"><b>ALTADOR</b> | In an attempt to distract from the ongoing corruption scandal, the Altador Cup Committee has announced they will be releasing a new line of Altador Cup Player Action figures with new hats. <p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/fruSnUl.jpg" width="320" height="240"></p><p>The Altador Cup Committee is providing a sneak peak of the prize shop for this year's supporters', a press release released by the Altador Cup Committee earlier today read, 'We are excited to announce the release of a new line of Altador Cup action figures complete with snazzy new hats.</p><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/9TrkPkK.jpg"></p><p>
The response from the Altador Cup community is divided. 'I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it,' Techo Superfan said, 'I didn't know I needed this in my life, but those hats are so cute!</p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/altador/altadorcup/2009/ctp_862.gif"></p><p>As long as The Altador Cup Committee keeps releasing quality merchandise like this, I'll continue to support them no matter what!</p><p>
However, the leaders of the various nations involved in the cup were not happy with the announcement. </p><p>With malice aforethought, The Altador Cup Committee is wantonly obfuscating the asseverations of malversation made by Queen Fyora earlier this week,' King Hagan said, 'Brightvale comports with Faerieland to requisition that King Altador intervene.</p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/altador/altadorcup/2009/news_image/ac9_brightvale.gif"></p><p>
King Hagan's brother, and regnant of neighbouring Kingdom Meridell, King Skarl, offered a differing opinion. </p><p>Keek, ah dinnae hae ony idea o' whit mah smartybreeks bro'er say, 'n' ah ne'er will.

</p><p>Dem whit Queen Fyora say ur wor'yin', bit Meridell stauns by Altador 'n' 'is Cup Committee.</p><p>
As he was speaking, an assistant whispered something in his ear and King Skarl abruptly left the press conference.</p><p>

After waiting for a few minutes, a photographer for The Very VERY Stale Bread snapped this picture.</p><p>

<font size="7"><b> Altador Cup Committee Corruption Exposed!</b></font></p><p>
<font size="6"><b>Stop or else war!' Queen Fyora Threatens</b></font></p>
<p>
<font size="2"><b>ALTADOR</b> | An investigation by The Very VERY Stale Bread has revealed a corruption scandal within the Altador Cup Committee. It has been revealed that the Altador Cup Committee has been taking bribes by various teams to fix matches and predetermining outcomes of matches before they even began. The Lost Desert Scandal is just the latest, and the only one they have been caught in the act. <p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/zsVCvkV.jpg" width="351" height="151"></p><p>It's the reason why we keep asking for donations for our team each year, despite being the winner of it on three separate occasions,' a Kiko Lake player told The Very VERY Stale Bread anonymously, 'Each year, we win and do well, but the Committee keeps asking for more and more Neopoints each year.</p><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/4ev8YXY.jpg"></p><p>It's getting really hard to sustain for such a small nation like ours, and we are struggling to even get salaries because the Committee is taking a larger and larger portion of our fundraising proceeds each year. It really needs to stop! It's bleeding us dry!</p><p>
Kiko Lake is not the only team affected by the corruption scandal, as other teams like Faerieland have been caught in the crossfires before, only to have taken the blame entirely for the corruption. </p><p>
An exclusive interview with Faerieland's regnant Queen Fyora revealed the truth of Faerieland's fourth place finish in the thirteenth Altador Cup, and the allegations of foul play the followed. </p><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/9VcduxW.png" width="400" height="225"></p><p>I'm comfortable breaking my silence on this issue,' Queen Fyora said, 'The prolonged damage to Team Faerieland's reputation, whatever it may have been, has been far too much considering what it is.  Enough is enough. </p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/57_faerie_stone.gif"></p><p>Morale has been at an all time low come Altador Cup time, and whenever possible the Committee likes to remind everyone that "Faerieland was cheating". </p><p>
Queen Fyora revealed the situation and conditions of the deal she struck with the Altador Cup Committee for the thirteenth cup: 'The Altador Cup Committee approached me with a proposal to secure Faerieland the title. </p><p>I negotiated with the Altador Cup Committee a princely sum, a significant portion of my Hidden Tower profits, to discreetly secure Faerieland the Altador Cup victory.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Committee completely botched it and very, very obviously fixed matches in Faerieland's favour.</p><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/3B3gA3x.jpg" width="270" height="300"></p><p>The Committee very publicly announced that Faerieland had been cheating throughout the cup, and continue with that narrative today. I had personally threatened them to come forward to King Altador himself with my story, but they threatened back, expressing that they would permanently ban Faerieland's participation from any future Altador Cup proceedings.</p><p>I thought it would raise morale for our home team, and let other lands know Faerieland is still a force to be reckoned with despite our crash down to Neopia, but I realise now my actions were wrong. To make matters worse, we did not even win the cup that year, let alone get a podium finish.</p><p>Lost Desert has an enormous wealth between the two kingdoms of Sakhmet and Qasala. I suspect they pooled their resources together after being approached by the Committee as I was, and once again the Committee has botched it, and will once again shift the blame to them as they did to us.</p><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/qpNTGM1.jpg" width="250" height="125"></p><p>I suspect Altador himself is aware of this situation, seeing how well his team is going this year, and although Faerieland and Altador have historically had a very close bond, I warn him: If this extortive behaviour from his Altador Cup Committee does not stop next year, I will personally be extending an olive branch to Princess Amira and Prince Jazan to form an alliance, and we <i>will</i> go to war over this.'

<font size="6"><b>Tensions Run High As Desert Squad Under Scrutiny</b></font></p>
<p>
<font size="2"><b>ALTADOR</b> | In a shocking development, the Altador Cup Committee has announced they will be launching an official investigation into the Lost Desert squad this year. This comes after the team has been accused of suspicious plays, and the revelation that right defender, Luvea Trivon, hired an elite robotic cheering squad to help them win the Make Some Noise contests. <p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/altador/altadorcup/2010/join-bg.jpg"></p><p>Alright, fine, whatever,' a member of the Altador Cup Committee said today at a press conference while rolling her eyes and sighing exasperatedly.</p><p>From what I have heard from the community, Team Lost Desert are a blemish on the face of this year's cup, and we're taking certain steps here, and someone somewhere is going to have to do something about it.' The committee member suddenly danced off mid-press conference singing about how she likes 'to dance a little sidestep'.</p><p>
The response from the community has been split, while some welcome the announcement, others have expressed their concern. 'This is complete and utter scarabug dung,' a long-time Lost Desert supporter said, 'I can't believe that they might be punishing the entire team for the behaviour of a few bad actors.</p><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/KoLFJpu.png"></p><p>I'll admit our Make Some Noise results are a bit suspicious, but our Yooyuball team is 100% legitimate! There's no way the robots could have been manipulating the players on the pitch!</p><p>
</p><p>
Tensions escalated on the Yooyuball pitch today between members of the Lost Desert squad after Left Forward Derbi Azar received a yellow card for picking up fellow teammate Luvea Trivon, then throwing him into the opposing team's goal as if he were a Yooyuball in what was frankly an astonishing play. 
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/UtctLyk.jpg" width="539" height="396"></p><p>
</p><p>It is said that Team Captain Leera Heggle will not be reprimanding Azar for this action.

<font size="6"><b> Brightvale Loses Match For Minor Spelling Error</b></font></p>
<p>
<font size="2"><b>ALTADOR</b> | The Lost Desert squad won their match by default against Brightvale today after it was revealed there was a spelling error on Brightvale's pre-match paperwork. <p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/altador/altadorcup/signup_full.gif"></p><p>We have zero tolerance approach to spelling errors,' a representative from the Altador Cup Committee said at a press conference today, 'The fact that Brightvale misspelled something on their signup sheet is utterly reprehensible. We cannot let such heinous misgivings go unpunished.</p><p>I understand many people have concerns about the legitimacy of the Lost Desert squad, but frankly, we have more important things to worry about!' </p><p>
<img src="http://i.ibb.co/J38F0R2/What.png"></p><p>
In the signup sheet in question, the name of right forward <i>Reb Weemelott</i> was misspelled as <i>Rob Weemelott</i> instead. This forced the Nimmo to be unable to play as he was not recognised as a player for Brightvale that matchup. The resulting action meant Brightvale was a player short and was forced for forfeit. </p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/medieval/brightvale/wiseking_angry.gif"></p><p>
The blame was placed solely on none other than King Hagan of Brightvale himself, who oversaw all the team's Altador Cup paperwork. 'This is unmitigated chicanery!' King Hagan announced to his subjects in Brightvale earlier this morning, 'For this unwonted erratum of my chirography to have precipitated our own anomalous ceding to the Lost Desert troupe is a veritable indignation!</p><p>For the committee to exclude the miscreant mountebanks bedevilling the Lost Desert squad only to put weightage onto the infinitesimal solecism of our progeniture's administrivia manifests in unequivocal ineptitude!'

<p>
<font size="2"><b>ALTADOR</b> | An image of Team Lost Desert's Make Some Noise grandstand from their matchup against Moltara which surfaced early Sunday morning has caused controversy.<p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Gba5TZo.png"></p><p>
 The image, featuring multiple robot clones in Lost Desert colours, has renewed calls for the Altador Cup committee to review Team Lost Desert scores and calls for the squad to be disqualified.</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/351_techo_fan.gif"></p><p>Fans are in an outrage over this image. 'It is totally unfair,' Techo Superfan said, 'Lost Desert has countless robots doing all the work, and we're doing the hard labour ourselves in cheering on our favourite teams!
My throat is so sore from trying to outscream them.
Lost Desert should get an automatic last place.</p><p>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/KoLFJpu.png"></p><p>
Others supporting Team Lost Desert deny any wrongdoing. 'Disqualifying Lost Desert would be very unfair to those of us who have been putting in a lot of work supporting our team,' A longtime Lost Desert supporter said, 'Even without the robots, our team would still be dominating the cup. I don't see what the big deal is anyway! Team Virtupets has a lot of robots on their team, and no one ever complains that they're cheating!</p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/altador/altadorcup/teams/2008/lostdesert_1.gif"></p><p>
Left Defender Luvea Trivon says he supports all his fans, 'I welcome all Lost Desert fans to cheer us on at the Yooyuball matches,' Trivon said, 'While all of our supporters are dedicated and amazing, they're far too quiet. So, I enlisted the help of an elite cheering squad to cinch us that win.</p><p>
The draik then taunted as he abruptly played <i>Sweet Victory</i> out of the portable loudspeaker he brought with him, 'So what if we have a little extra robotic support in the grandstands. What are you going to do about it? It's perfectly legal under Altador Cup Rule Amendment 25 that robots are allowed to compete in the Altador Cup proceedings.'
