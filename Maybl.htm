      <a href="#home" class="back">« Back</a>
      
      The <a href="//www.neopets.com/art/gallery.phtml">Art Gallery</a> is Neopet's own place to display art by users! Think of it like an art museum, but of your own pieces.<br>
	  Unlike the Beauty Contest, where you can only enter drawings of a pet you own, the Art Gallery welcomes any and all Neopets-related art, from Pets to Faeries to Petpets to Items and beyond.
      <br><br><div class="box">
        <ul>Accepted art forms:<br><li>Traditional art (oil paintings, pencil drawings, etc.)</li>
          <li>Digital art (2D images or 3D models made on a computer, phone, or tablet)</li>
          <li>Sculpture (clay, paper mache, 3D printer, etc.) </li>
          <li>Crafts (knitted dolls, fingernail art, baked goods, etc.)</li>
          <li>Any mix of the above- If it can be called art, it can be entered!</li>
        </ul></div>
      
      <ol><li>The Art Gallery updates twice a week, once on Tuesdays and once on Fridays. </li>
	    <li>You can click on an entry to see it in full-size, or click on the artist's name under their entry to view their lookup.
        </li><li>The theme of each update can be found on <a href="//www.neopets.com/calendar.phtml">the Neopian Calendar</a>, or more specifically on tnt_contest_judge's '(Month) Art Gallery Schedule!' board on the Art Chat: <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=160491261&amp;next=1#bottom">current month's board</a></li>
        <li>Note: Occasionally there are days where the gallery will be updated, like May 8th, which have no Calendar event. These are Random Days where anything goes! </li>
		<li>Each entry in the Gallery will usually have 1 or 2 pages of 12 pieces each, but it is possible to have 3 or more pages depending on volume of entries!</li>
		<li>Each entry in the Gallery will have 1-3 pieces featured on the Front Page of the News!</li><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neopedia/212_mr_lupid.gif"></ol></div>
    
    <div class="page" id="why">
      <h1>Why enter?</h1>
      <a href="#home" class="back">« Back</a>
      
      So, what do you get for entering the gallery, besides your image featured on the site?
      <br><br><div class="box">
        <ul> Art Gallery Prizes:
		  <li>10,000 NP</li>
          <li>Picture Competition CHAMPION!!! Trophy</li>
          <li>One (1) random rare item (paint bush, petpet paint brush, doubloon, red codestone, select petpet, etc.)</li>
		  <li>Your art admired by all of Neopia!</li>
        </ul></div>
      
      <ol><li>With each piece you get in to the Art Gallery, you will get the set of prizes listed to the left.</li>
        <li>Additional times will update your trophy on your lookup to track the number of images you have gotten in to the Art Gallery.</li>
        <li>Rare" is relative- some petpets on the list are only worth a few thousand NP, while the paint brushes can be several million!</li>
        <li><b>Note: Like any contest or event that gives a NP or item prize, the Art Gallery is not enterable on side accounts.</b></li>

      <a href="#home" class="back">« Back</a>
      
      <a href="//www.neopets.com/art/rules.phtml">The official Art Gallery rules page is here</a>, but I will also list them below.
      <br><br><div class="box">
        <ul>Quick Rules:
		  <li>Make your own art</li>
		  <li>Make it art you haven't won another contest with before (Beauty Contest, Pet Spotlight, etc.)</li><li>
          </li><li>Make it up to 600x600px</li>
          <li>Make it smaller than 80KB</li>
		  <li>Make it a .gif or a .jpg in all lowercase (no filename.JPG)</li>
          <li>Make it Neopets related (and thematic to an upcoming Day)</li>
          <li>Make sure to have fun!</li>
        </ul></div>
      
      <ol>Official Rules:
	      <li>It must be 100% your own work, adapting an existing picture is not acceptable.<a href="#fairuse">(more on this in Fair Use)</a></li>
		  <li>You may enter a picture up to three times a day (24 hours). Note entering the same picture multiple times will NOT increase your chances of being chosen.</li>
		  <li>Pretending someone else's picture is your own will get your account frozen.</li>
		  <li>Your picture cannot have any copyright or trademark symbols on it. Having your username is fine, but it cannot be copyrighted.</li>
		  <li>You must include a title for the image.</li>
		  <li>The picture must include Neopets, or a character from the Neopets site.</li>
		  <li>If you are uploading your image it needs to be a gif or jpg (in lowercase letters).</li>
		  <li>All entries submitted must be unique to the Art Gallery (meaning that they have not won any other creative contests). Also, note that if your entry does get accepted into the Art Gallery it cannot be used for any other creative contests in the future, including the Beauty Contest.</li>
		  <br>
		  Additional Tips:
		  <li>Your image <i>must</i> be at most 600 pixels wide and 600 pixels tall.</li>
		  <li>Your image <i>must</i> be at most 80 Kilobytes in size.</li>
		  <li>Your image <i>must</i> be of file type .gif or .jpg (no .png accepted!)</li>
		If any of the above limits are not met, you will get an error when entering.

      <h1>How to enter</h1>
      <a href="#home" class="back">« Back</a>
      
      Alright, so, let's say you have an entry all ready to submit. Great! Let's walk through that process.
      <br><br><div class="box">
        <ul>Quick Reference:
		<li>1.)Navigate to <a href="//www.neopets.com/art/submit_art.phtml">Submit Page</a></li>
          <li>2.)Choose file on computer</li>
          <li>3.)Choose title for entry</li>
		  <li>4.)Choose Theme you're entering for</li>
          <li>Submit!</li>
        </ul></div>
      
      <ol><li>Your first order of business is to make sure it is the right time to submit. The Art Gallery is updated TWICE a week, once on Tuesdays (at variable times) and once on Fridays (at 12pm NST). </li>
<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/r8JIIRu.png" width="10%" height="10%"><i> handy reference- drag to the address bar to see larger</i><br><li><b>The best time to submit is 1-3 days BEFORE the update day. For example: Lupe Day is on Friday, May 1st. You can submit anytime April 29 to May 1 (before 11am NST). If you submit before then, it will be mixed in with the previous update's entries. If you submit after, it might be too late. Time your entries well so you have the best chance!</b></li>
<li> Make sure you have the file saved as the right size, dimensions, and filetype. Double check that you know where the file is on your computer, and that it is a <b>.gif or .jpg</b> file type, <b> 600 by 600 pixels</b> or less, and has a file size of <b>under 80 kilobytes</b>.</li>
        <li>Head over to the <a href="//www.neopets.com/art/submit_art.phtml">Submit Page</a>. You can get here from this guide, or from the "click here" text in the header of the Art Gallery itself.</li>
        <li>Click the "Choose File" button and open the file you want to submit from your computer. It should replace the "No file chosen" text with your file name.</li>
        <li>Give your piece a title! Keep it simple with "Happy Lupe Day!" or be as creative as you'd like.</li>
        <li>Choose the day/theme you're submitting for in the dropdown. Note: depending on when the Day falls relative to when the Gallery is updated, you might not see the Day in the list. If that's the case, just submit it under "Other", or, if it's for a specific species, you can put it under that pet type too. Either will be fine!</li>
        <li><b>For example: Hissi Day is on May 4th, but its Gallery update won't be until May 5th. If you wait to submit your art until the 5th, there will not be a Hissi Day option. No problem, just submit under either "Hissi" or "Other"!</b></li>
        <li>Note: If you are submitting for a "Random" theme day, you can either submit in a category matching the theme of your image, or just under "Other".</li>
        <li>Submit!</li>
		If all goes well, you will be sent to a new page that says "YOUR ENTRY HAS BEEN ACCEPTED!" in big green letters. That means you are all set and your entry will be judged!
		<br>If all does not go well, you will get an error page specifying what is wrong with your entry. It could be too large in file size, or wrong file type, or too big in dimensions. Alternatively, you might have already used up your 3 entries for the day, in which case you just have to wait until tomorrow.
		<br>If you are having trouble resolving your entry errors, <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=13">the Art Chat would be happy to help.</a>

      Do you have a question that is not listed? <a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=_kate_e_did_">Please Neomail Me!</a>
      <br><ol><li><b>Q: Who is tnt_contest_judge?</b><br> A: tnt_contest_judge is a real TNT staffer who judges our creative contests! She also posts frequent boards on the Art Chat for new Art Gallery pages or the Monthly Calendar. She will try to answer questions asked on her boards, and can be identified by her blue background!</li>
<li><b>Q: When is the <i>best</i> time to enter for the Art Gallery?</b><br> A: 1-3 days before the update (which will be either Tuesday or Friday). For specific dates, see tnt_contest_judge's <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=160491261&amp;next=1#bottom">current board</a></li>
        <li><b>Q: If I think of a really funny title, or have a cool username, will that give me a higher chance of getting chosen?</b><br> A: No! tnt_contest_judge cannot see titles or usernames when selecting winners, only on the final approval screen after everything is decided.</li>
        <li><b>Q: The image I want to enter has a different design than the Neopets design. Is that OK?</b><br> A: Art Gallery entries have to fit in official Neopets world. Because of this, drawing an existing Paint Brush color or character like Fyora is OK. But, if you invent a new color, or draw a Neopet as a human, etc, it is not a good candidate for the Art Gallery. <i>Remember that you can always enter multiple versions of a piece, so you can enter one closer to the official art, and one farther, if you're not sure what is best.</i></li>
        <li><b>Q: My piece didn't get in. Can I resubmit it for a different day?</b><br> A: Yes! If you did not get in to the Gallery, you can enter the piece again for a Random, etc, day as long as it fits the theme. Don't worry if you do not get in right away, sometimes there are just too many good pieces, and it makes tnt_contest_judge's life difficult.</li>
        <li><b>Q: My piece didn't get in. Can I submit it for the Beauty Contest/Pet Spotlight/other contest?</b><br> A:Yes! Just do not go and submit it again to the Art Gallery, if it has won a different contest.</li>
        <li><b>Q: Will I get a Neomail if my art is displayed in the Gallery?</b><br> A: Yes! Starting May 2020, tnt_contest_judge has coordinated neomails to be sent out to winners. They currently have a "warning" symbol and header, but don't worry, it's a good message! She will also make a new board for each update, with the names of the winners.<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/oOSXtsd.png" height="30%" width="70%"><br><i> example of notification message </i></li>
        <li><b>Q: Why do file endings have to be in lowercase?</b><br> A: You should avoid entering a file with the format "filename.JPG" or "filename.GIF" instead of "filename.jpg" and "filename.gif" because UPPERCASE file endings are known to get lost in TNT's system! No one wants that, so be sure it is lowercase!</li>
        <li><b>Q: I made an image for a pet day that didn't get chosen, and it says "Happy [pet] Day!" on the image itself. Can I enter it for a different theme?</b> <br>A: It's fine to re-submit art that didn't get in to one day, but be sure to remove any text on the image that would specify it is for a theme that is other than the one you are entering! For example, if you have a picture of a Lupe holding a cake, and on top of the image it says "Happy Lupe Day!", you should remove that text before entering it for a different theme.</li>
         <li><b>Q: Can I enter more than one image, or more than one version of the same image, for one contest?</b> <br>A: Yes! You can enter up to 3 times a day (24 hours, not contest). You can enter multiple versions of an image, or different images all together, but know that only one can be chosen per round.</li>
        <li><b>Q: I accidentally entered an image won the Beauty Contest, and it was chosen for the Art Gallery. What do I do?!</b><br> A: Everyone makes mistakes. You can just let tnt_contest_judge know on one of her boards, and she will remove it with no punishment. Just try not to do it again!</li>

      <h1>Fair art use</h1>
      <a href="#home" class="back">« Back</a>
      
      This section is to discuss a very important topic when you are making and entering art: fair use.
      <br><br><div class="box">
        <ul> Yes or No? Read each and understand why.
		  <li>Can I enter art made by another user (with or without their permission?): NO <img src="//images.neopets.com/portal/images/neomail/no_nf.gif"></li>
          <li>Can I enter art that I traced, but colored myself? (Official site art or not): NO <img src="//images.neopets.com/portal/images/neomail/no_nf.gif"></li>
          <li>Can I enter art that I made using references? (Official site art or not): YES <img src="//images.neopets.com/games/gmc/2014/nc_checkmark.png"></li>
          <li>Can I enter art that my sister/brother/mom/dog made?: NO <img src="//images.neopets.com/portal/images/neomail/no_nf.gif"></li>
          <li>Can I enter art that I already won the Beatuy Contest with?: NO <img src="//images.neopets.com/portal/images/neomail/no_nf.gif"></li>
        </ul></div>
      
      <ol><li>Referencing is perfectly OK to do, and a great learning tool. I use references of Neopet images whenever I draw a new Gallery piece. If artists didn't use references, our Cybunnies would end up looking like Jetsams!</li>
        <li>But, it is important to understand the difference between <b> referencing </b> and <b> copying </b> and <b> tracing </b>.</li>
        <li>When you <b> reference </b>, you look at an image of something you want to draw, like a Neopet or item, in order to understand proportion, color, features, and then you draw your own unique art from memory.</li>
        <li>When you <b> copy </b> or <b> trace </b>, you put an image that you want to draw <i> exactly </i> under your paper, and draw on top of the lines, changing nothing and not expressing your creativity. Alternatively, you could also copy digitally by just taking pieces of another person's art and putting them in your image. Even if you add to the image, something that is traced or copied is stealing and NOT ALLOWED. </li>
        <li>Note: Copying/tracing <i> is </i> allowed in the <b>Beauty Contest</b> if it is original Neopets site art. This is NOT the case in the Art Gallery, so do not try to enter a piece using anyone's art, even site art.</li>
        <li>In summary: make sure your art is 100% your own! You're allowed to look at pictures to know how to draw Neopets, but do not be tempted to trace or copy.</li>
        <li>If you have concerns about whether your piece follows these rules, feel free to post on the Art Chat or find the Monthly Art Gallery board. </li>
        <li><b>Note: If you believe you see a piece in the Art Gallery that is a copy or tracing, DO NOT post their username or any identifying information on the boards. <a href="//www.neopets.com/autoform_abuse.phtml?abuse=report">Simply report the user using this form.</a> Even rule breakers do not deserve harassment, and you can be warned if you do post their information.</b></li>
      <br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/worlds/geraptiku/colouring/25.jpg" width="30%" height="50%"><br><i>Be like this Techo and use a reference!</i><br><br><br><h1> A Real-Life Example of Referencing vs Tracing/Copying </h1><br></center>
Here I will give a visual example of these terms, so you know which to avoid! <br>Let's say I wanted to draw Mr. Chipper, the Lutari Ice Cream Cart Salesman from Happy Valley. Here are my reference images: <br><br><center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/namPbu1.jpg"><br><i>These are official Neopets images and items.</i><br><br></center><br>

Do you see which one is by <b> reference </b> and which is by <b>tracing/copying</b>?<br></center>

<center><div class="box">
        <ul>Answers:
		<li>The <i>left</i> drawing is by <b>reference</b>. I looked at Neopets' images to know how to draw Mr. Chipper and his ice cream, and then drew my own interpretation of the scene.</li>
          <li>The <i>right</i> drawing is by <b>tracing/copying</b>. I used the Neopets' images too closely, and traced the lines exactly. This is NOT allowed in the Art Gallery, because it is using art that is not your own to make something you claim as original.</li>
