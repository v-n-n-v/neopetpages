<a name="introduction"></a><h2>An introduction to the Park:</h2>
Petpet Park is a new section of Neopets where you can create a Petpet and play and interact with it in a cute enviroment. You can actually see your petpet walking around and see other user's petpets too, and talk to and play with them :) .<br>
You don't need to create an account in order to play it, if you have a Neopets account you can log in with it.
There you have a number of fun activities you can do, just like in Neopets. In the Park you create a new petpet, but you have to choose from the ones available: pinixy, hifflo, kassegat, etc, basically the ones that appeared in the Petpet Park plot.<br>
Here you have the species that are currently available:<br><br><table><tr align="center"><td><img src="http://www.petpetpark.com/images/gameguide/speciesDipniPopup.png"><br>Dipni</td><td><img src="http://www.petpetpark.com/images/gameguide/speciesDrymPopup.png"><br>Drym</td><td><img src="http://www.petpetpark.com/images/gameguide/speciesHiffloPopup.png"><br>Hifflo</td></tr><tr align="center"><td><img src="http://www.petpetpark.com/images/gameguide/speciesKassegatPopup.png"><br>Kassegat</td><td><img src="http://www.petpetpark.com/images/gameguide/speciesOukinPopup.png"><br>Oukin</td><td><img src="http://www.petpetpark.com/images/gameguide/speciesPinixyPopup.png"><br>Pinixy</td></tr></table><br>

You have initially four colors to choose from, but you can paint them too just by getting a bottle of ink! If you want to learn how to draw them, you can click <a href="//www.neopets.com/petpetpark/howtodraw.phtml">here</a>.<br><br><br>Here is the map of the Park:<br><br><p align="center"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/maps/map_10_09_2009.png" width="550" border="0"></p>
<br>
As you can see, there are many places you can visit and explore (and it seems there will be more in the future) :) . To open it, just click on the map button on the lower part of the screen.<br><br><p align="center"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/map_icon.jpg"><br><i>Click me! Click me!</i></p><br>

Now, let's talk about the basics of the Park!:
<br><br><a name="food"></a><h2>Getting food:</h2>
Every petpet needs to eat, right? And eating is important because it improves its mood, so now I'm going to tell you some ways to get your petpet some food without spending all your PPP in the process ;)<br>
Have you noticed that the Park is full of trees and bushes? Well, some of them can be very useful. All you have to do is get very close to one of them, position your mouse over it until it changes from an arrow to a hand and click to shake it. Easy, right? If you are lucky (it may take several clicks) a fruit will fall of it and go into your inventory! Now you can drag it to your petpet and it will eat it.<br>
Now, here is a list of the places were you can find bushes that give out fruit:<br><br><table><tr><td><h3>Blockberry bushes:</h3>
 <img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/Fruits/blockberry.jpg"><br>
They are located in the Lucky Valley.<br><br></td><td><h3>Nauticalberry Bushes:</h3>
<img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/Fruits/nauticalberry.jpg"><br>
They are located in the Tugg Harbour.<br><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Fashionberry bushes:</h3>
<img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/Fruits/fashionberry.jpg"><br>
They are located in the fashion field<br><br></td><td><h3>Apple trees:</h3>
<img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/Fruits/apple.jpg"><br>
They are located in the Pawvillion.<br><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Ghostberry bushes:</h3>
<img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/Fruits/glowberry.jpg"><br> 
They are located in the Shadow Grove.<br><br></td><td><h3>Sandfruit bushes:</h3>
<img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/Fruits/sandfruit.jpg"><br>
They are located in the Laughging Springs.<br><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Coralberry bushes:</h3>
<img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/Fruits/coralberry.jpg"><br>
They are located at Jiggybug Lagoon.<br><br></td><td><h3>Peppermelon bushes</h3><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/Fruits/peppermelon.jpg"><br>They are in the Grenn's farm area.<br><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Sour Cranapple bushes:</h3>
<img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/Fruits/sour_cranapple.jpg"><br>
They are located at Jiggybug Lagoon.<br><br></td><td></td></tr></table><br><br>

A fun thing about fruits is that when you harvest them somethimes you can see how the fruit dissapears from it and then grows back again ;).<br><br><br>





Of course you can also get food from the shops. Here's a list of places that sell food:<br>
*The munchery<br>
*Pirate's Plunder<br>
*Salty N' Sweet Carnival Treats<br><br><p align="center"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/map_shops.jpg" width="550"></p>
<p>What are you waiting for? Go and check them!</p>
















<h3>Fishing</h3>
A new feature in the park is fishing. All you have to do is buy a fishing rod and find a place to catch some Blue Gawpers! A fishing rod costs 100 PPP at Petpet emporium (see image below for the location of the shop):<br><br><p align="center"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/ppark_fishingpole.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/ppark_interobj_fish.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/ppark_fishingpole.gif"></p> <p align="center"><i>Oh oh...</i></p>
<br><p align="center"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/map_fishing_poles_arrow.jpg" width="550"></p>
The arrow shows the place XD<br><br>

This is what you are looking for:<br><br><p align="center"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/PetpetEmporium.jpg" width="550"></p><br><br><p align="center"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/FishingRod.jpg" width="550"></p><br><br>

After you bought the fishing rod, you have to 'equip' it. To do this, click in the closet button and drag the rod to your petpet:<br><br><p align="center"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/equiping_fishing_rod.jpg" width="550"></p><br><br>
Now you are ready to go get some fish! There are two places where you can find them:<br><br>
1)-:<br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/Fishes.jpg" width="550"><br><br>
2):<br><p align="center"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/fishing_2.jpg" width="550"></p><br><br>
Now all you have to do is get close to the water, put your mouse over the fishes's shadows to make the cursor change into a buoy and click! It's really easy, so go try that now!<br><br><p align="center"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/fishing.jpg" width="550"></p><br><br>

NOTE: You can't eat fish right now :( .<br><br><br><a name="games"></a><h2>The games/Getting your petpet dressed:</h2>
<h3>Games</h3>
<p>Getting my petpet dressed is one of my favorite parts of the game! But, in order to get clothes, you need PPP (Petpet Park Points). The way you get them is the same as in Neopets: you have to play games (you can also get PPP from quest/jobs, but we'll see this later).<br><br></p><p>Here's a list of the games:</p>
*Counting cluckens<br>
*Frantic Farmer<br>
*Qwertymizer 5000<br>
*Mystery Maze<br>
*Wizard's walk<br>
*Three ring soaker<br>
*Sling and splash<br>
*Wardrobe wars<br>
*Blocktacular<br>
*Stack Happy
*Skeedadle<br>
*Neeterball<br>
*Boat Blasters<br>
*Deadpin bowling<br><br>
And here is a map to help you locate them:<br><p align="center"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/maps/map_games.jpg" width="550"></p><br><p>Are you still there? Don't waste your time and go play some games! ;)</p><br>
Notes:<br><br>
The kitchen is not open yet :( .
<br>
There is a limit on how many PPP you can get from games per day of 1200 PPP :(.<br><br><br>
Tip!:<br><br>
The best advise I can give you about getting PPPs is this: play all the games, see wich one you like the most playing and gives you a good amount of points in a short time, and this one is your best way of getting PPP! I, for example, like to play Skeedadle, some other people prefer Wardrobe wars, and some other are really good at Blocktacular, it is really up to each one's likes, dislikes, habilities and computer XD ;) .<br><br><h3>Clothing shops:</h3>
Here's the list and map of the places where you can get clothes for your petpet:<br>
*Gilbert's gurgling gifts<br>
*Fin's feathers and fashion<br>
*Pirate's Plunder<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/Maparopas.jpg" width="550"><br><br><a name="quests"></a><h2>Jobs/Quests:</h2>
First of all, what is a quest/job? They are random little jobs the locals ask you to do in exchange for some PPP and items. OK, but... how do you do them? It's easy, you just have to talk with the locals that have a yellow exclamation point over their heads and do the tasks they ask for.<br>
Here's a map with the location of the available jobs you can do:<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/Mapaquests.jpg" width="550"><br><br><h3>The Jobs:</h3>

In order to get it, you need to go to the Pawvillion and shake the apple trees there until a black apple falls down from one of them (to do this, you need to get very close to a tree and hover one of them with your mouse until the cursor changes from an arrow to a hand and cthen click as many times as necessary).

When you have done this, go to talk again to Mr. Grimsby, and he'll ask you to deliver a black apple pie to Flerilda at the Fashion Field. This is her:<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v106/Kagoky/PetpetParkGuide/image063.png"><br><br>

It is a new section of Neopets where you can create a Petpet and play and interact with it in a cute enviroment. You can actually see your petpet walking around and see other user's petpets too, and talk to and play with them.
<br><br><b>Do I need to create an account in order to play it?</b><br>
Not necessarily, if you have a Neopets account you can log in with it.<br><br><b>Do you create a new petpet there if you currently have a petpet on neopets, or can you make a character from your current petpet on here?</b><br>
In the Park you create a new petpet, but you have to choose from the ones available: pinixy, hifflo, kassegat, etc, basically the ones that appeared in the Petpet Park plot.<br><br><b>What are servers for?</b><br>
When you are connected to a server, you can see all the petpets that are in the same server as you, so, if you want to play with a frien, make sure to choose the same server both of you.<br><br><b>Why are there soo many servers to choose from?</b><br>
Well, think about this: imagine there are 100 people playing at the same time, and since you can see all the petpets that are in the same server as you, the game would become very laggy. With more servers this shouldn't happen.<br><br><b>How do you check your petpet's mood?</b><br>
Just click on the button with the ID card in the down-left corner of the screen.<br><br><b>Why do some words become red when I type them in the chat box?</b><br>
That's either because the word isn't allowed or it hasn't been added yet to de dictionary yet. If you think the word should be allowed, just send a bug report or feedback.<br><br><b>Why ins't the post office/university/mall/adoption center/ some other place open?</b><br>
Because the park is new and TNT is still working on some of the features.<br><br><b>What are expansions and patches?</b><br>
They are updates, they usally include new items and places to visit.<br><br><a name="faq_items"></a><b>Items:</b><br><br><b>How do I use my items?</b><br>
Well, it depends: if it's something edible, just open your inventory (click on the backpack-like image in the lower-right part of the screen) and drag it to your petpet, so simple as that. If it is a piece of clothing, just clcik on the closet button (the one that has a 'coat hanger' on it) and customize your petpet from there.<br><br><b>Can I sell/discard/donate/delete my items?</b>
No, you can't do that right now. Let's hope TNT would make that possible in the future ;).<br><br><a name="faq_moodandabilities"></a><b>Petpet's mood, habilities and etc:</b><br><br><b>How do you improve your Petpet's mood?</b><br>
You can feed them (just drag the food item from your inventory to your petpet).<br><br><b>How do you improve your petpet's abilities?</b><br>
Petpet Park is still beta so this feature is not active yet.<br><br><b>How do you unlock new tricks?</b><br>
It seems that you have to level up the abilities of your petpet (this isn't available yet).<br><br><b>How do you change your petpet colour?</b><br>
First, you have to go to Petpet emporium (it is located in the Market lane) and buy a bottle of ink. Then go to Groomtopia (in the fashion field) and enter the 'color change' station. Then, dragg the bottle onto the colour station and you are ready!<br><br><a name="faq_parkpoints"></a><b>Petpet Park Points:</b><br><br><b>Why are the payouts so low?<br></b><br>
This is because TNT is still balancing the game, so they raise the game's payout little by little. After all it wouldn't be fun to have a lot of PPP and can't spend them on something fun because you've already bought every item in the game ;) (trust me, this was the feeling during the closed beta test where the item prices were pretty low...).<br><br><b>Is there a limit on how many  PPP (Petpet Park Points) can you make a day?</b><br>
There's a limit of 1200 PPP per day.


<b>What are the best ways to make PPP?</b><br>
Well, it depends on various factors: how fast is your computer, what your gaming abilities are and what games you like. If you are good a it, skeedadle is a good way to make points, some people prefer wardrobe wars and some other are good playing blocktacular. Doing quests is also a good way of making points and you can also get items at the same time!<br><br><br></div>
