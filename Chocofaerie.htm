Have you ever taken a personality quiz? Have you ever thought, "These quizzes are so stupid! I wish someone would make a COOL quiz, about something worthwhile... like muffins"? Have you ever wondered what kind of muffin you would be if you were born a muffin? No? Er, well... take this quiz anyway!<br><br><b>IMPORTANT:</b> The user called chocofaerie is NOT me. You can all stop bothering her now xD. The only active accounts I have are burning_super_nova (main account), ch0c0latey (side account), and petplanet (side account). Also, please do not assume that just ebcause someone links to this quiz that they are me. They aren't. Just wanted to clear that up for you all ^_^
<br><br><b>If you would like to neomail me, please neomail me on my main account, burning_super_nova (be sure to check out my <a>FAQ</a> before neomailing me).</b> Also, this is the Muffin Quiz. If you choose, you may call it the "m00fin" quiz. But do so at your own peril, the word "m00fin" was blocked from neopets for a short time.<br><br><img src="http://cgi.boingdragon.com/count/teenygirl4ever/1.gif" width="49" height="87"><br>

Well, there ya have it. My quiz. I hope you enjoyed it, and tell your friends!<br><font color="red">IMPORTANT: Please do not steal/copy my quiz. I worked very hard on it. Do not ask to put the actual quiz on your petpage, it messes things up (though you can link to it all you want!). I realize that many people are inspired to make their own quizzes after taking the Muffin Quiz, and I know that it is hard to make it completely original when you are still thinking in the mindset of mine, but please try your best to make your quiz different. People who steal on purpose will be reported. </font><br><br>
I'd like to take a moment to shamelessly plug a few sites. This quiz is dedicated to my_plushie_gallery and her guild, as well as the DIQ, and the pwnful guild "Ebilici○us M0○fin". Also, don't forget to check out these cool guilds:<br><a>Phantom Phans</a><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/guilds/guild.phtml?id=699297">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Guild</a><br><br><br><br><font size="6">My Awards</font><br><br><br>
