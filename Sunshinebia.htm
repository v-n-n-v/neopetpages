<br>This page is just a basic <i>guide</i> to having good necoash trading etiquette. Why is there such a thing? Well, we are trading items that we paid real money for, therefor people take NC trading seriously. For your trades to go smoothly, having good trading etiquette is a must. Most of these should also be common sense, but that's just me :P

<br><br><center>♡▶<font size="12"><b>PLEASE READ
<br>&amp; follow;</b></font>◀♡
<br><br></center>
❤ Be understanding if someone doesn't want to trade with you. No matter what the reason is, even if you don't agree, just accept it and move on.
<br><br>
❤ Don't ignore people/offers. If someone takes the time out to mail you an offer, you can take 2 seconds and mail them back, even if you don't want to do the trade.
<br><br>
❤ If you are boxless, please state that first and foremost. Not everyone can "add a GBC" to the trade, so make sure the other trader is aware you need boxes first.
<br><br>
❤ Anything 250nc-300nc and below is considered 1 GBC. For instance, a Faerie Quest Cookie is 100nc in the mall, usually they trade 1:1 (1 cookie for a 1 cap item) - if an item is more than 1 cap it DOES NOT MEAN that the value is now doubled. FQCs = 1 GBC.
<br><br>
❤ Make sure you reeeally want to trade. The other trader also had to use a box to send their half of the trade, and to make them use another box just to send back the item because you "changed your mind" is wrong. So, be sure you really want to do the trade before agreeing to it.
<br><br>
❤ Please don't list 20 million "rules" when trying to trade. It's okay to list things that need to be said, but having the first 6 posts of your board be filled with "rules" that we "have to obey or else you will ignore/block" us if we dont listen to them, is pretty ridiculous and will probably get you less trades.
<br><br>
❤ Threatening to block/report/ignore someone JUST because they made an offer you didnt like or because they didn't obey a rule of yours, is a bit harsh. We get that these are items we pay money for, but there isn't a need to be so demanding, you can simply just say no thank you.
<br><br>
❤ Try and wait 24-48 hours for a response from a trader. If you mailed someone about a trade, don't expect an answer within 5 minutes every time, not everyone is online all day. If you see the person you mailed posting board, clearly just ignoring your mail then mail them again or simply forget the trade since they are obviously ignoring you. But it is always considerate to give a trader 24-48 hours to respond before making accusations/mailing them again/or reporting/blocking them.
<br><br>
❤ If you are doing a 3 or 4 way trade, let the other traders know. If they will be receiving items from different users, please let the trader know so they are aware the items will be coming from different people. 3/4 way trades can get kinda confusing/messy but if you are doing one always let the trader you are trading with know that there are more than 1 person involved in the trade.
<br><br>
❤ Let people know if you are seeking your full WL, certain WLs, or if certain items are higher/lower priority. Nothing is more confusing when you see someone say "seeking WL" and you offer an item thats ON their WL, just for them to say no thanks or "not seeking that item right now"...yes its ON their WISHLIST. Make a priority WL or TELL people which items you ARE seeking specifically.
<br><br>
❤ Have a tradelist / wishlist. It's not mandatory to have both a TL and WL, but it does make it easier for other traders to see what you have and what you want. Using dress to impress or jellyneo to make a TL or WL is a great idea!
<br><br>
❤ If you are going to value your 3-4 cap item at 4, then expect the other trader to possibly value their 3-4 cap item at 4 as well. If YOU can value YOUR item higher, then so can the other trader. *If both values are commonly valued 3-4, then it's a fair trade.
<br><br>
❤ If someone posts an offer on your board that you don't like, don't ignore them. Bumping over someones offer just because you don't want to trade is rude. Tell them no thank you and move on.
<br><br>
❤ Don't beg people to trade with you. Making a joke about it is different. But if you are literally BEGGING people for free gifts or to discount their items for you, don't trade neocash. Most of us have spent lots of money on these items.
<br><br>
❤ Don't put items in your TL that you don't actually want to trade. If you want to "show off" your items, make a closet list. To lead people to believe you have an item they want only to be told it's actually not UFT...yet it's IN your TL, is just cruel lol.
<br><br>
❤ Making up your own values because you "don't use the value guides" is just silly. The guides are there to give us a base value of an item. You may or may not agree with it, but (when updated) thats what people are currently trading for, so be realistic. Asking for 30 GBCs for a 10 GBC item, just because you don't "agree" with the guides, makes you sound greedy.
<br><br>
❤ Do not accept the other traders items before sending your half of the trade (unless told to do so by the other trader).
<br><br>
❤ Always be aware that the other trader is ALSO trading items they spent real money on. Make offers that are fair and that if reversed YOU would find the trade fair as well.
<br><br>
❤ Please and thank you go a long way. This is should be common sense. After a trade is finished it's always nice to say thank you and wish the trader good luck. It just simply shows you are happy with the trade and are appreciative.
<br><br>
❤ If someone doesn't want to trade with you, don't harass them until they do. Harassment of ANY kind if against the rules. Mailing a trader a million times in a row because they have an item you want, even after the trader said no, is harassment. Learn to accept that not everyone may want to trade with you, regardless of the reason.
<br><br>
❤ Don't string a trader along. If someone is holding an item for you, and you decide you don't want to trade, tell them! It's not fun reserving an item and rejecting good offers just because you are "waiting" for the other trader to decide.
<br><br>
❤ Be welcoming to new traders. If you see a new trader struggling with values or anything regarding NC, help them. Remember that we were all "new" to NC trading and needed help ourselves.
<br><br>
❤ If someone gifts you an item, thank them. Common sense...don't accept the item and not thank the gifter, you wouldn't do that in person would you? If you think it was a mistake, mail them and ask. It could get messy if you accepted an item that wasn't meant for you without making sure, even if it was an accident.
<br><br>
❤ Once you agree to a custom trade, and the trader buys something from the mall for you, don't back out! If they spend the NC on an item you want, it is beyond rude to back out last minute, just to have the trader stuck with an item they don't want and now have to trade.
<br><br>
❤ If you have already agreed to a trade, then someone makes a "better offer", it is horrible trading etiquette to back out of the first offer just to trade for the "better" offer. This can be debated, because they are YOUR items and you have the right to trade them for what YOU want. But try not to agree to a trade before you are 100% positive thats what you want.
<br><br>
❤ Don't ask a trader to add to the trade right before the trade is done. Last minute changes can be annoying, especially if the trade was fair in the first place and NOW the trader wants you to add more items.
<br><br>
❤ Just because someone is over offering for an item doesn't mean that is now the "new" value. If someone desperately wants a 5-6 cap item and they are offering 10 for said item, doesn't mean that it's now valued at 10. Know the difference between an over offer and the actual current/general trading value.
<br><br>
❤ If an item in your TL is HTPW, it doesn't mean you need to triple the current value. If you have an item valued at 5 but since it's HTPW, you want 15 for it, then don't even bother trading it. If it's THAT hard to part with then just keep it, no one will offer double/triple an items value when they can get it for current value.
<br><br>
❤ Using your NC mall Album as a Trade list isn't the best idea. You have to sort all your items, since your album lists EVERY item (including boxes/gbcs) that you own. And people will have to look through every item you have ever owned just to find the items that are ACTUALLY UFT, it's just very time-consuming and confusing. *It's also courteous to have clickable WL/TL links, as I mentioned before...Dress to Impress, Jelly Neo, or even your gallery are good ways to make a TL and WL.
<br><br>
❤ Don't lie to get items. Making up ridiculous sob stories, or lying about "quitting NC" just to get GBCs, is truly sad. It may get hard sometimes to get trades, but lying just to get more trades is pathetic.
<br><br>
❤ Making fun of someones TL because it's small or full of buyables, is just horrible. We all started out with very few NC items, remember that. It's sad that people have even seen this happen. How about don't make fun of anyone, period? We all are here for the same reason, let's not be bullies.
<br><br>
❤ Always be kind. You don't know what someones personal life is like or know what someone may be going through, so...just be kind to one another. We all are here to trade neocash items, so we all have at least one thing in common. I know we can all try and get along. And help others out, as well as use our good trading etiquette to make trading go smoother and overall enjoyable :D
