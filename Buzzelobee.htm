<h1>Description</h1>

Criticism doesn't necessarily mean you don't like something. Clearly, I love this game and plan to continue playing for many years to come, but I think there are important things that need to be fixed/changed to keep the user base. Here are changes I've compiled from the "ideas/suggestion" board that would make a positive impact on the site. 

<h1>Quality of Life</h1>

<br><b>Fix Pas.swo.rd Reset:</b> Currently, the messages for pa.sswo.rd resets are not going through, so users are being locked out of their accounts.

<br><br><b>Glowing Quest Icon:</b> The quest icon in the top bar should have a slight glow effect or alternate state when you haven't viewed or completed your dailies. Nothing animated or obtrusive, just something that draws your eye when you look up there as a little reminder to check them.

<br><br><b>Quest Pool/Activities Updated:</b> The quest pool needs to have a standard rotation as well as more diversity in the quest types to keep things from being stale! (Examples: Play cliffhanger, ask King Skarl a joke, do an Edna quest, etc.)

<br><br><b>Neomail History/More Storage:</b> Updating Neomail is on their roadmap, but it has been some time since we've had an update and it desperately needs an overhaul. Neomail needs to show "sent" messages, as well as an increase in inbox size.

<br><br><b>Remove Frozen Players from Shop Wizard Results:</b>Pretty self explanatory. It stinks when you're kadding or think you found a good deal, and then see the dreaded "This users shop is frozen" message.

<br><br><b>Some Users Cannot Submit High Scores:</b> There are a handful of users (myself included) who can submit flash games for neopoints, but their scores no longer show up on the high score tables. This has apparently been an issue since 2012.
<br><br>
More info can be found here: https://www.neopets.com/~wacona

<br><br><b>Hidden Tower Rotation:</b> Rare Stamps, Paintbrushes, P3s, Books, etc. should rotate in the Hidden Tower to combat inflation (Perhaps randomly changing every quarter)

<br><br><b>More SDB Sort Options:</b> Safety Deposit Boxes need rarity and quantity options for sorting.

<br><br><b>Broken Pages Fixed:</b> There are a few important games/dailies not in the games room that should be fixed: Kiko Pop, Qasalan Expellibox, Coconut Shy, etc.

<br><br><b>Guild Tab Leads Directly to Guild:</b> If you are already in a guild, it is silly the guild tab leads to the hub. It should lead directly to your guild if you already have one so you don't have to go to it through your user lookup! The Hub page is also outdated and needs an update!

<br><br><b>Easier Access to "Edit Pet Page":</b> Currently, you must access the "Edit Pet Pages" through the old layout. Please consider adding it to the "settings" tab on the new layout.

<br><br><b>R100s Currently Don't Stock:</b> Help inflation by re-releasing R100s in NPC Shops

<br><br><b>Scale Down the Map on Browser:</b> Finally the map is fully functional again! Yay!!! For browser though, it appears extremely large. If it can be scaled down, it would be much easier to navigate :)

<br><br><b>Gallery - Split Duplicate Items:</b> Let us split duplicate items into different gallery pages.
I.E. if I have 4 Red Apples, and I want to show 1 each in four separate categories (Like Apple, Red, Food, Fruit)

<br><br><b>Item Donation Daily:</b> Bring back the donation part of the latest Faerie Festival event to exchange for capsules (but no point system)

<br><br><b>Higher Limit on Trading Post:</b> With the cost of many items, the limit should be raised on the trading post (potentially 5 mil?)

<br><br><b>Blocked Users:</b> As of now, blocked users are only restricted from Neomailing you. They should be unable to see/comment on your boards (and vice versa) and from bidding on your auctions. 

<br><br><b>Item Limit:</b> When you reach your limit for the day on Money Tree/Rubbish Dump/Secondhand, it gives the same message as if you had missed the item. Instead, tell the users they've reached their max :)

<br><br><b>Shop Bans:</b> Provide a notification when users are banned from restocking along with a countdown timer

<br><br><b>Releasing Pets:</b> With how cluttered the pound gets with terrible names, it would be nice for users to be able to "release" a pet out into Neopia, thus freeing up server space and allow pets to be free after being in the pound for years...and years...and yeeeeaaars.....(With a 30 day window for a pet to return before being wiped from the servers)

<br><br><b>More Bookmark Options:</b>Some pages, you can bookmark (such as dailies). Other pages should be as well, such as pet pages, poems, neopian times articles, etc!

<br><br><b>Second Layer of Captcha For Restocking:</b> With botters running rampant, one way to slow them down is add a second layer of captcha for restocking (ex. text with audio, click all tiles with X in them)

<br><br><b>Petpet Customization:</b> You should be able to add your petpet to your customization next to your pet.

<br><br><b>Updates to Neopian Times:</b> Suggestions include update the NT with a mobile friendly layout, update Submission system for better submission tracking, improve the backend for editors sorting submissions, longer Description Box for Submitting Entries. (For a much more thorough list/descriptions, check out this petpage: https://www.neopets.com/~Bloozard)

<br><br><b>Board Notifications:</b> There should be a notification when you are replied to on the boards and a tab to see all the boards you have responded to/created.

<h1>Neocash/Premium</h1>
<br><b>Fix Try-On in the NC Mall:</b> The try-on feature rarely works in the NC mall and needs to be fixed.

<br><br><b>Make Additional Pet Slots Tradeable:</b> NC pet slots cannot be traded. Please allow this to be an option!

<br><br><b>NC Christmas Letter:</b> NC Christmas Letter for 500 NC. One per user; which lets you put the name of any NC item you wish for to receive on Christmas. This would be an amazing treat to the community and allow many Neopians to complete their NC Customizations dreams as well as Gallery Goals that they would otherwise never be able to complete or afford.

<br><br><b>Open the Fist:</b> It's silly some Neopets eternally have a fist even when they're not holding an item. All those poor Xweetoks, Blumaroos, and Yurbles forever look like they are crushing a bug. I can see putting down the arm fully may interfere with clothing, but at least let them open their paws if they aren't holding an item.

<br><br><b>NC Rewards:</b> Most apps/games offer for users to voluntarily watch ads in exchange for in-game currency. Please consider adding a feature like this to the site!

<br><br><b>Customization Spotlight Updates:</b>
<br>-With the amount of unique wearables now, users can create super creative for invisible pets and should be allowed to enter the customization spotlight.
<br>-Changing the image size from 2 to 5
<br>-Item minimum to enter

<br><br><b>Less Zoning Restrictions:</b> It would open more customization possibilities if you could stack items on top of each other. Example: A skirt over a dress instead of behind it; A shirt on top of a dress.

<br><br><b>Multiple Outfits:</b> Since customization is such a huge feature, you should be able to save outfits you've created so you can toggle between them. 

<br><br><b>Neocash Trading Post:</b> As of now, trading neocash items is all on mutual understanding that the other player will send the item they promise. For more security, a Neocash Trading Post would be wonderful! 


<br><br><b>More Premium  Perks:</b>  Some simple quality of life additions would be nice, like higher inventory capacity and increase in the amount of auctions you can have at a time. 

<br><br><b>Buyable Neoboard Flairs:</b> There should be buyable flairs for your Neoboard posts. They would add a little saying/color/icon to the left side of your neoboard post.

<h1>Battledome</h1>

<br><b>HP Increase: </b> Give opponents a fourth HP tier in the battledome

<br><br><b>Option to Cancel Mystery Island Training Course:</b> While it's understandable the techo masters are strict,  there should be an option to cancel a course to either get a new random set of codestones (Man, Eo's just keep getting more and more expensive), or if you accidently click on the wrong course. Perhaps there could be a cool down (2 hours?) before you can attempt to train again. 

<br><br><b>The Return of Defenders of Neopia:</b> Defenders of Neopia gives more of an incentive to train pets and was a fun aspect of the site.

<br><br><b>Battleground Of The Obelisk Visibility and Updates</b> Battleground Of The Obelisk needs to be visible on the battledome home. (Including the countdown) Could even be a banner when battling. There should also be more incentives to keep playing such as trophies that count up battles and specific prizes after a certain amount of won battles.

<br><br><b>Battledome Tab in New Layout</b> For the new layout, the Battledome should be added under the "games" tab. As of now, you need to be in the old layout to find it. 

<br><br><b>Update to the Neggery:</b> It currently is pointless to trade in neggs at the neggary. It would be helpful if more neggs could be traded in like the Treasure Map Negg, or if there were other ways to achieve neggary points.

<br><br><b>Lower Level Item:</b> Since level can dictate how much a training session will cost, it would be great to have a consistent way to lower a pet's level. Perhaps a Negg or potion!

<br><br><b>Release New Weapons:</b> The battledome community desires new weapons.

<h1>Other</h1>

<br><b>Update Logs:</b> It would be nice to have a page dedicated to the updates TNT has been working on each day, even if it is just a bug. Players like to see there are changes being done to the site, even if it's fixing things behind the scenes. 

<br><br><b>Equipping Colors:</b> For converted pets, it would be nice for user to be able to toggle between different colors they have painted their pets in the past. It should remain species specific, though. For example, if you zap/morph a tonu multiple colors but it changes to a aisha, all past colors are erased.

<br><br><b>Benchmarks for Collectables:</b>Books, gourmet food, and stamps should award ribbons/trophies after you've collected so many in the category. As you collect more and reach different benchmarks, it would upgrade. It would not replace the "top 100" trophy, but give another incentive for collecting as "top 100" is very tricky to get into with the amount of players on the site. (Example: After your pet reads 100 books, they get a blue ribbon. When they reach 300 books, it changes to a small trophy.)

<br><br><b>More Animations:</b> It would be neat to being able to drag items to your pet (book, toy, grooming) and there is an animation to give more life to the site. It doesn't even need to be unique to each item - for foods, a chunk can be bitten from the image. Grooming, your pet slightly glows. Same for the rainbow pool or morphing potions. Have smoke cover your pet for a second, and then reveal the new look!

<br><br><b>Rainbow Fountain for Petpets:</b> We desperately need a rainbow fountain for petpets. They should either make a new Petpet Faerie, use the Grey Faerie (since she always requests petpets…maybe painting would help cheer her up!), or Boochi since he's not allowed to zap pets anymore. 

<br><br><b>Revamped Neolodge:</b> The Neolodge should be updated so different hotels/add-ons have incentives. For example, the better the room, the higher percentage of positive random events. Or maybe a battle hotel that has a chance to increase a random stat. It would also be nice to see images of the room/additions you've booked instead of it being entirely text based. There could also be a neopoint sink by hosting an "Update the Neolodge" event, similar to the "Save the Wheels" event!

<br><br><b>They/Them or Removal of Gender Options For Pets:</b> It was lovely they added more gender options for users. Since this a site with heavy emphasis on character design, it would be nice for our pets to also have more gender options! (Even a canon character, Antola Maeir from team Shenkuu, is canonically trans! :))

<br><br><b>Longer Posts on the Boards:</b> The character limit is too small for the boards. Please consider making it longer for the boards :)

<br><br><b>Cheaper Upgrades for Galleries:</b> At a certain point, it can cost 100,000's of neopoints to upgrade a gallery 5 spaces. There should be a cap on upgrade costs.

<br><br><b>Neoboards History:</b> It would be helpful to have a neoboards tab that shows you all of the boards you have recently chatted in so you don't have to scroll for ages to find neoboards again. In addition, it would also be really great if we could see what boards we already clicked on, regardless of having posted something in it or not.

<br><br><b>Increase Character Limit for Pet Descriptions:</b> CSS is getting more and more intricate with cool stuff to do, but between that and actually writing a description you can run out of room fast. More space would be very helpful!

<br><br><b>Release Petpets from Petpet Park:</b> The Petpets from the old game Petpet Park had really unique designs. Even though the game has been lost to the sands of time, it would be a lovely homage to release them on the site. 

<br><br><b>Apps Connect to Main Game:</b> When Ghoul Catchers was around, you could play to earn neopoints. More people will play if there was an onsite connection.

<br><br><b>Neopets Creation Descriptions:</b> At the Neopets creation page, it would be nice to have a short description of each pet to be more immersive for people unfamiliar with the pets.

<br><br><b>Updated Dailies/Wheels Prize Pools:</b>Most dailies/wheel prizes need an updated pool since most items are now worthless - Meteor Crash, Council Chamber, etc. One way to mitigate that is to add more items to "The Coincidence"

<br><br><b>Dark Mode:</b> We need a dark mode for nighttime use and for those with low-vision. 

<br><br><b>Daily Items:</b> Give more uses for the items that are apart of our dailies. (Fishing, pick your own, etc.)

<br><br><b>Incorporate Ruffle for Classic Neohomes:</b> Since ruffle has been incorporated with games, put it in different areas of the site, included Neohomes.

<br><br><b>Return of More Games:</b> With ruffle now implemented, many of the games we love are now accessible. That said, many are still broken like Bilge Dice, the Hannah Games, etc. 

<br><br><b>Neohomes 3.0:</b> Neohomes were a big part of the site until they stopped working. Bring a new and improved Neohomes 3.0 would be a wonderful thing to add.

<br><br><b>Designation/Restrictions for Side Accounts:</b> Side accounts are useful for guilds, storing pets, having another gallery, etc. It would be nice to be able to designate it as a side account, and it restricts features that are only allowed on mains. 

<br><br><b>Posts not Disappearing on Threads:</b> Posts disappear on threads after a months. Specifically for role-players, this loses context on the story. If a thread is active, keep the posts as well!

<br><br><b>Save the Wheels Type Event:</b> There are many areas of the site that need to be updated (pages converted to the new layout, games converted, neolodge updated, pound decluttered with better search functions, Hidden Tower rotation, etc.) There could be an event hosted similar to the "Save the Wheels" where users donated Neopoints to update all the wheels. There was a leaderboard/trophies, prizes, and it created a Neopoint sink. Could be a fun way to help transition the site!

<br><br><b>Return of Spotlights:</b> Pet Spotlight, Petpet Spotlight, and Petpage Spotlight should make a return!

<br><br><b>Return of Dr_Sloth Auctions:</b> Dr_Sloth auctions helped bring retired back into circulation! A return would be wonderful.

<br><br><b>More Music Integrated on the Site:</b> We need some battledome music, events, and plot music to liven up the site! (though users should be able to toggle it on and off)

<br><br><b>Return of Key Quest and Habitarium </b> Self explanatory :p 

<br><br><b>Pet Personalities:</b> We need more options for pet personalities. A site with a focus on pets should provide more options for that! 

<br><br><b>Eye Toggle:</b> Most female and male pets have different eyes. It would be nice to not make it gender specific, rather being able to toggle between the lashed/unlashed eyes to have more variety in customs!

<br><br><b>Stamp Avatar Choice:</b>Since it takes so long (and MANY neopoints to fill out a stamp album), instead of having one avatar choice per set, a second option should be released so there is a choice (though still counting as one avatar towards total)

<br><br><b>More Sorting Options for Gallery:</b> Currently, it is difficult to sort a large gallery.  For "All Items", it would be nice for it to be ordered by category, then by rankings in said categories, without having to go thru the agony of reordering them all manually.

<br><br><b>A 'Playful Stat' That Tracks Unique Toys: </b> It would be nice to have another stat (like Gourmet Food or Books) that utilizes unique toys your pet has played with. Toys shouldn't disappear when you play with them so you can resell them afterwards! (though toys can break on rare occasions)


<br><br><b>Plot Comics Hub/Neopedia Glow-Up:</b> Neopets has a large amount of fascintating lore, and much of it is impossible to view. They should convert the comics and should make a "book" that compiles them all in one place for people to view. (Link it with the Neopedia!) Jellyneo has their own remastered versions that look stunning, so they could likely team up with them: bookofages.jellyneo.net/history/neopets-plots-remastered

<br><br><b>Neohomes:</b> While Classic Neohomes can still be accessed with ruffle, Neohomes 2.0 are inaccessible. Though it is un.clear if "World of Neopets" will be it's replacement since it is advertised on the hub. This was a fun feature for your Animal Crossing and Sims fans. 

<br><br><b>More Incentive for Games:</b> The Neopoints given out by games is extremely low in this Neopian Economy. Perhaps beefing up the neopoints or adding some sort of prize pool could help!

<br><br><b>Updated Boons:</b> Battle of the Obelisk needs some of the boons rotated/updated. For example, "Featured Game Perk" is entirely useless at the moment. 

<br><br><b>Update Neodeck:</b> TCG cards are a neat collectible on the site and provide fascinating lore, but it is a very dated feature on the site. There should be an option of a pin as many cards are highly valuable and more cards should be added (not just the Premium ones)

<br><br><b>More Avatars:</b> Avatars, specifically ones you work for, are always coveted. Some suggestions that have been floating around are...
<br> -King Terask: Awarded by defeating King Terask in Neoquest II 
<br> -Tombola Avatar: Awarded randomly when playing Tombola

<br><br><b>Complete Stamp Album Pages:</b>There are many albums, such as Neovia, Krawk Island, Maractite Coin, Moltara, Treasures of the Deep etc. that aren't complete and don't have an avatar associated with it.

<br><br><b>Updated Stamp Album:</b> The stamp album needs to converted and updated (could also be customizable) Have the pages flip, allow us to add a background image to each page. It could also be neat to allow us to organize each page and even scribble notes on it! Descriptions should also be available if you click/hover on a stamp.

<br><br><b>Neoschools/University:</b> Since there is no longer a current workaround for boring books/toys, gross food, and petpets your pet doesn't like, it would be cool to implement a Neoschool (remember when that was an idea maaaany years ago? :p) where pets can go!
<br> -"Useless items" could be used as study materials. Examples: Basic pencil, old paper, homemade marmalade, baked beans, etc.
<br>-The classes could include: Culinary Class, Animal Husbandry, Recess, and The Library.
<br> -Of course, we also need teachers at school! Perhaps the Library Faerie for books, Underwater Chef for food, Donny for Toys, and Baelia the Grey Faerie for Petpets.
<br> - A great location would be Brightvale, the knowledge capital of neopia!

<br><br><b>HTML Games Info:</b> Currently on the pages for updated games (html games) you can not see the high-score table to know what amount you need for trophies, your personal best etc. The new pages actually lack a lot of useful information that they used to have including difficulty, scores sent, NP ratio, favourites and game information.

<br><br><b>Re-examine Terminology/Art for Mystery Island and Shenkuu:</b> It would be nice for both these worlds to be re-examined with another eye. While Neopia is a fictional land, we also want to make sure it is respectful of the cultures it is referencing. For example, on Mystery Island, the designs and art depict aboriginal culture in a very stereotypical and poor way(random bone piercings, feathers in hair, arm bands, etc.) Or for Shenkuu, in current day connotations, using the term "exotic" can be seen as offensive in reference to Asian culture. 

<br><br><b>Dye-Works for Neopoint Items:</b> Similar to the NC Dyeworks, clothing from Uni's Clothing Shop and Cog's Togs should have on option of being dyed different colors!

<br><br><h1>Shelved by TNT (for now!)</h1>
<br><b>Plots Revisted:</b> Source - editorial 997 <br><br> I was just wondering if you think you guys would ever do a "return of an old plot" event? Like say, have a "time travel machine" that acts up all funky every few years when no new plots are active and allows players to participate in an old plot they may have missed or just really enjoyed. (you know- to same the timeline!) The most fun i ever had on Neopets was during the Tale of Woe and I often wish I could participate in that event again. Even if these plots no longer awarded points, i'd love to do them for the site themes and trophies. ~valerie608 <br><br><b>What a wonderful question! Presently, our team is focused on developing the upcoming plot scheduled for release next year. However, we have also begun internal discussions on potential ways we could bring back older plots so that users who missed out on them can experience these storylines onsite_  So although it unfortunately won't be any time soon, we are hoping to bring replayable classic plots back to the site someday! ~~Aesop </b>
