Welcome battlers, to the page explaining what MBL is all about. Basically it's bringing a fun and balanced metagame to the highest level of battling. This league simulates the main ruleset of <b>Fyora League</b> with adjustments due to the high HP and high levels of the pets competing. If you aren't familiar with the rules of FL that's fine, I'll lay out all of the official rules for MBL itself on this page, most of which come from FL. First off, here are the stats required to fight in this league:
<br><br>
HP: 1000+ (For now 4,000 HP will be THE LIMIT)<br>
Strength: Maximum Boost (750+)
<br>It's obviously highly recommended that pets have the maximum boost for Defense as well, but it is <i>not required</i>.<br><br><br>RULES:<br><b>NOTE: This is just the standard ruleset, some tournaments may use different rulesets and/or remove some bans</b></center><br>
Anagram <i>clones</i> are banned: This means that Skardsen is allowed, but Reif, Ari, Thare, Thigl, and Tawre are not.<br>
Wand of the Dark Faerie and Illusens Staff are allowed <b>only when they do not have the ability to multi-heal (above 25% HP for WoDF, 20% for IStaff)</b>. Illegal usage of these weapons will result in automatic loss of the battle. (So be sure to keep track of this)
<br>
Super Attack Pea and Gra pes of Wrath are banned due to lack of countermeasures. 
<br>Sword of Lameness is allowed to pets under 2,500 hp only<br>
Lens Flare and Throw Pillows from the Level 50 abilities are banned. Shhh may be used.
<br>
Warlock's Rage is banned<br>

Rejuvenate is banned due to glitchy nature<br>

Level 500 abilities are banned (as with all other Once-per-Day abilities)<br>
Freezing is <b>allowed</b>. Both battlers would have to agree to not use them.<br>
Single Use Items are also allowed, however you can only equip <b>one freezer</b> and <b>one full blocker</b>.<br>Common battling etiquette applies - If you are frozen, deselect all weapons and abilities to honor that freeze.<br><br><center><br><br><br><br><br><img src="http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee381/agsynth/MBLFormula_zps0085200c.png"><br><br><img src="http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee381/agsynth/MBLFormulaTable_zps79d0b807.png"><br><br>NOTE: A DRAW RESULTS IN BOTH PETS BEING AWARDED THE POINTS THEY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IN A WIN, DIVIDED BY 2<br><br><br><br><br><br></center>

This event will be a simple point grabbing competition. Under the MBL Scoring Formula, each competitor will battle TWICE against each opponent. At the end, the top 3 point totals will receive trophies. In addition, battlers who aren't in the top 3 can still earn trophies by completing certain achievements:<br><br>SHOCK-BLOCKER<br>Achieved a perfect record against all lower HP Opposition (No draws)<br>(<i>Min. 3 opponents</i>)<br><br>TOP (UNDER)DOG<br>Scored 125 or more points in a single battle (Not through DQ/forfeit)<br><br>SKETCH ARTIST<br>Acc.umulated 5 or more draws throughout the event<br><br>COMPLETIONIST<br>Completed sets with ALL (active) opponents<br><br><img src="http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee381/agsynth/mblscoreboard1_zpsjcypq8zs.png"><br><br><img src="http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee381/agsynth/MBLHP_zpsbhcq9ko8.png"><br><br><br>Sign ups:<br><br>drazu (2390)
