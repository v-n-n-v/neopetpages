<hr><p style="text-align: center; color: -blocked-;"><font face="Georgia">On February 14th, 2023, Neopets announced the addition of the Valentine color that could be painted on Neopets. Prior to this, this color was introduced for Petpets on February 14th, 2015. Valentine has historically been one of the most commonly requested colors on the site and the reception to it has generally been positive. I am among those who had highly anticipated the addition of a Valentine color. And I designed a Valentine Techo of my own!</font></p>

Armed with a bow and arrow, this lovestruck squamate would love nothing more but tempt with fate in the realm of love and romance. This affable trickster could make a great addition to the Valentine colored Neopet library!</font></p>
<br><br><p style="text-align: center; color: -blocked-;"><font face="Georgia">Over the past three years, I have designed a variety of rather unrealistic possible colors on Techos; which includes the many removed colors over the years (i.e. Unicorn, Glass), colors restricted to Petpets (i.e. Spring, Picnic), colors restricted to specific species of Neopet and are unlikely to be released for other species (i.e. Alien, Garlic), and even colors that appeared exclusively in the now defunct spinoff game Petpet Park (i.e. Faerie Skies, Pi√±ata). A small sample of such designs are shown below.</font></p>

<br><center><h3 style="color: -blocked-;"><font face="Verdana">The first Valentine Techo design (2020)</font></h3></center>
<hr><p style="text-align: center; color: -blocked-;"><font face="Georgia">I started the project in February 2020, and the first non-pet color I put on a Techo was Spring. One day later on February 9th, 2020, I drew a design for a Valentine Techo and it would become the second ever Techo of this category that I've drawn. I mainly took inspiration from the Valentine Acko and the cupid Shoyru that most notably appeared in KeyQuest. Here's what the first design of Valentine Techo looked like:

<hr><p style="text-align: center; color: -blocked-;"><font face="Georgia">One year later, on February 12th, 2021, I decided to redraw my Valentine Techo design with a lineless look to it, as I began experimenting with a lineless style at the beginning of 2021. This design iteration removed detail from the lace skirt and wings.</font></p>

<br><center><h3 style="color: -blocked-;"><font face="Verdana">Further refinements (February 2022)</font></h3></center>
<hr><p style="text-align: center; color: -blocked-;"><font face="Georgia">If it hasn't already been evident, Valentine Techo was a design that I was somewhat proud of, because I kept coming back to it instead of drawing it once and never revisiting it again. On February 14th, 2022, I redrew Valentine Techo once more. The wings would remain simple, but the lace skirt would gain more detail. In addition, a heart shaped pin was added to the waist of the lace skirt.</font></p>

<br><center><h3 style="color: -blocked-;"><font face="Verdana">Making it look official (September 2022)</font></h3></center>
<hr><p style="text-align: center; color: -blocked-;"><font face="Georgia">My desire for a Valentine color for actual Neopets had reached somewhat of a boiling point around August 2022, among other colors. I had to do something with this passion and energy, so I decided to do "official-esque" designs for various Techo designs I've made over the past two years at that point, which would be redrawing them in the static default pose. Valentine Techo was one of them, and was given this treatment on September 26th, 2022.</font></p>
<br><br><p style="text-align: center; color: -blocked-;"><font face="Georgia">Up to this point, the design had stayed fairly consistent, but I'd argue this was a more intuitive redesign. While the wings gained detail, albiet to a more simplistic degree; the skirt lost detail. The heart shaped tail ornament was also dropped from this design. The main philosophy of this design was to make it look as if it had been introduced in the mid to late 2000's, hence the more simplistic look and black outlines.</font></p>

<br><center><h3 style="color: -blocked-;"><font face="Verdana">Final changes (June 2023)</font></h3></center>
<hr><p style="text-align: center; color: -blocked-;"><font face="Georgia">On February 14th, 2023, the Valentine color was finally released to be paintable on regular Neopets. This immediately meant that my original Valentine Techo design was outdated and had to get with the times, so I did just that on June 12th, 2023. Arguably the biggest design change to Valentine Techo yet, this design more or less standardized the design to fit in with the rest of the Valentine pets released. Some minor things like the heart pin and yellow eyes are still present, however.</font></p>

<p style="text-align: center; color: -blocked-;"><font face="Georgia">With that history lesson, I hope you can understand why I'm passionate about this design of mine. It was among the first I've made for a personal project and having the ability for it to potentially cross the realm of canonicity is something that excites me. While I did suggest two colors over the past two years; a cotton candy inspired Candy Techo and a sticky hand inspired Toy Techo, I think this is one design I would choose to become official in a heartbeat, no pun intended.</font></p>
<br><br><p style="text-align: center; color: -blocked-;"><font face="Georgia">Thanks for listening to me, and I hope you'll be willing to support this design for the September 2023 Pet Day suggestions board! See you then!</font></p></center></center><BR><BR><BR>
