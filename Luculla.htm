<h2>Introduction
<span>— Welcome to Defense against the Dark... I mean, NC Trading! —</span></h2>

<div class="seventy">
<p>
Learning about NC trading can feel overwhelming, intimidating, and downright terrifying. But, never fear! This guide will help you navigate the Neocash world and join in the great community that is out there desperately awaiting your precious custom offers and gift box capsules!
</p>

<p class="text-center">
<sub>**This guide takes no responsibility for any limbs, souls, or family members that may be offered in the pursuit of acquiring precious NC items**</sub></p>
<hr><p class="text-center">
<b>Important:</b> Having issues with NC redemption? <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Hiradel">Check out this awesome page for more information!</a>
<br><br><i>
It is highly recommended that you read this guide in its entirety before trading! Be sure to check out the bookmarks tab for links to additional resources and the glossary at the end of this guide for item/trade abbreviation terms and descriptions :)</i></p> 


<p>NC items come from a variety of sources, including: mystery capsules, Mysterious Morphing Experiments (MMEs), site events (like Charity Corner), Key Quest tokens, NC Mall games (like Patapult), and, of course, the NC Mall itself. It is important to use JellyNeo's Item Database to learn about the NC items you are seeking/trading. This tool will give you a better understanding of how to acquire the item and whether the item is buyable in the mall or retired.</p>

<p>To begin NC trading, you will need to determine the items that you are seeking and have an idea of what you will offer in exchange for those items. First, I recommend ensuring that the item you are seeking fits your pet properly. Do this by using the JellyNeo Wardrobe or Dress to Impress customization tools and seeing how the item looks on your pet. Also, customization guides can offer advice, instructions, recommendations, and item alternatives to help you with your customizations; two great resources are <a href="/~Neocash">/~Neocash</a> and <a href="/~Trendei">/~Trendei</a> - be sure to check them out!
</p>

<p>
*It is important to keep in mind that it is <b>against the rules</b> to trade Neocash items for Neopoint items, or vice versa. So make sure the item you are seeking/trading is an NC item! If you own the item, an easy way to check is to put the item in your inventory. If the item is in the Neocash section of your inventory and has (Neocash) written underneath it, then it is a Neocash item. If you are seeking an item, use the JellyNeo Item Database to determine if it is an NC or NP item. A rarity of 500 (r500) means the item is a Neocash item. JellyNeo also  lists that it is a NC Mall item in brackets next to the item name.</p>

<p class="text-center">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZjEkE1X.png"><br><sub>Source: JellyNeo</sub></p>

<p>Many users begin NC trading because they are trying to acquire <b>retired</b> NC items. While some items <i>may</i> be re-released in mystery capsules, most items remain retired. JellyNeo's Item Database can be used to identify whether an item is retired, as it will show the retired date (if applicable) as a line underneath the release date. If no date appears there, and if the item cannot be found by searching for it in the NC mall, be sure to check out the "item notes" on the JN database, as it can help to determine if the item is, in fact, <b>buyable</b> from the NC Mall. The last step is important because KQ token and superpack bonus items do not show up when searched for by name in the NC Mall - such is the case with the Leafy Green Tree. By using JellyNeo's Item Database, we can determine that the Leafy Green Tree can be obtained through the Green Kau Key Quest Token - which is buyable from the NC Mall. Once you <b>open</b> a Key Quest token or superpack, the bonus item will appear in your inventory. If the item you are looking to acquire is retired, then the only way to acquire it is by finding another user with the item and negotiating a trade with them!</p>

<h2>Gift Boxes and Sending Items <span>-The lovely world of microtransactions-</span></h2>

<div class="seventy">
<p>
The next step in NC trading is learning about gift boxes. Unlike normal Neopoint items (like Codestones), *most Neocash items <b>require</b> a gift box in order to send the item to another user - even your side accounts.
<br><br><sub>*There are <b>a few</b> specialty Neocash items (like Easter and Sweetheart Grams) that <b>do not</b> require gift boxes in order to send them. Be sure to read the description of the item on JellyNeo's Item Database to find out if this applies to the item you have!</sub></p>

<p class="text-center">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ef90sJt.png"><sub><br>Hi, I'm Gift Box. You may remember me from such feature films as "I Love Trudy" and "Oh no, I'm Boxless!" (Troy McClure voice)</sub></p>

<p>
It is important to note that you <b>cannot</b> gift a gift box using another gift box. You also cannot gift items from the Elite Boutique. You can only send wearables, trinkets, cookies, capsules, cupcakes, and other miscellaneous NC items using gift boxes.
<br>Also, if a user sends you an item using a gift box, you only keep the item - the gift box <b>disappears</b>. 
<br><br>To send an item to another user, click on the <b>gift box</b> and <b>select</b> the item that you would like to send. The following images will show the process:</p>

<p class="text-center">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/5VBRYi2.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UU1Wvs6.png"></p>

<br><p>Then you will be given a confirmation screen and the last screen will show the following message:
<br>Congratulations! Your gift has been delivered to (username). You will receive a Neomail updating you on the status of your gift within 48 hours. Thank you.
</p>

<p>Did someone send you a gift but you lost the notification/neomail and aren't sure how to find the item? Check your <a href="//www.neopets.com/items/transfer_list.phtml">Item Event Log</a> to see if you have any items waiting for you! When you receive a gift, it will look like this:</p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0Kcrdul.png"><br><sub>Item Event Log</sub></p>

<p>When you "open" the gift box, it will show you the item you have been gifted. <b>You still have the option, at this point, to return the gift.</b> This allows you to open the gift box and take a peek at the item to make sure it is the right one before accepting it! The following image shows the screen after you have clicked to open the gift box:</p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FiRkrpn.png"><br><sub>Opened Gift Box Item Event Log</sub></p>

<p>Once you have clicked <b>accept</b> on the gift, the item will appear in your inventory.</p>

<p>If a user <b>rejects</b> the item you send to them: both the item and the gift box will be returned to you.</p>

<p>To return an item, you must click the <b>return</b> button in the item event log <i>and</i> you must select the second <b>return gift</b> button on the following screen to ensure it is returned:

</p><p class="text-center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BOcPuVj.png"><br><sub>Be sure to click me to return the item!</sub></p>

<p>Once a user returns an item to you, it will appear in your inventory and you will receive a neomail stating that the item was returned to you.</p>

<p>
Gift boxes can be acquired from
<br>- <b>Trudy's Surprise:</b> Trudy sometimes gives away gift boxes when you spin Trudy's Surprise! Be aware: you are not allowed to spin Trudy's Surprise on your side accounts.
<br>- <b>Redeeming Neocash Cards:</b> Redeeming 1000NC cards gives 2 gift boxes and 2500 NC cards gives 5 gift boxes. Redeeming a card will also provide you with a bonus NC item in addition to the boxes! Physical Neocash cards can be bought from your local Shoppers, Target, Walmart, and Toys R Us and codes can be purchased online_  Many users prefer redeeming cards since you <b>do not</b> receive boxes from purchasing Neocash by credit card through the NC Mall. 
<br>- <b>Gift Box Mystery Capsules:</b> Gift Box Mystery Capsules, also known as GBCs or Caps/Cubes, are the holy grail currency of the NC Trading world. These capsules, which will be discussed in the following section, provide a minimum of (and most often) 2 gift boxes <b>when opened</b> to a maximum of 4 + a Limited Edition box (though this is quite rare!). They also provide an item of at least 150NC value that is currently buyable from the NC Mall.
<br></p><hr></div>
</div>

<div class="colorblock" id="sectionThree">
<div class="fluid">
<h2>Gift Box Capsules<span>-The heart of the NC world-</span></h2>

<div class="seventy">
<p>Gift Box Mystery Capsules, often shortened to Gift Box Capsules, GBCs, or Cubes/Caps, provide a minimum of (and most often) 2 gift boxes <b>when opened</b> to a maximum of 4 plus a Limited Edition gift box (though this is quite rare!). GBCs cost <b>200NC</b> to buy from the mall (unless they go on sale; which, historically, has only happened twice a year - at the end of April and the end of November). When opened, they also provide an item of at least 150NC value that is currently buyable from the NC Mall. </p>

<p class="text-center">
<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_gbmc_fallingsnow.gif"><br><sub><br>Falling Snow Gift Box Mystery Capsule
<br>This is an example of the new "cubes" that provide a minimum of 2 basic gift boxes when opened.</sub></p>

<p><b>Caution:</b> There are old "gift box mystery capsules" that had a chance to provide a single gift box. They look like this:
</p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_mc_wispywinter_gb.gif"><br><sub>^ OLD gift box capsules - do not get these confused with the new cube-shaped capsules!
</sub></p>

<p>When traders are seeking/offering GBCs, they are referring to the new cube-shaped ones that guarantee a minimum of 2 boxes. Be sure that these are the ones you are offering before making the trade. If you are concerned, look up the capsule you have on JellyNeo's Item Database to double check that it awards a minimum of 2 gift boxes when opened. To send a GBC, like any NC item, you will need a gift box with which to send it. </p>

<p><b>You can also avoid any misunderstandings by specifying the full name of the capsule before you trade.</b> If you do own the older style capsules, be sure to check their value on the value guides - some may be worth a fair amount to a capsule collector!</p>

<p>It is important to note that the items GBCs provide are typically considered "junky" by seasoned traders because there are likely to be many of these free items in circulation. Though, this may not apply to newer items or items that are more popular/higher value. 
</p>

<p>GBCs are widely considered the currency of the NC trading world. This is because:
<br><b>- Everyone needs gift boxes and the only way to "trade" gift boxes is by using GBCs (which provide gift boxes when opened)
<br>- They have a set value (200NC)
<br>- They are "regularly" available</b>
<br>I say regularly, but this really just means once every month, for around 1 to 2 weeks - which is not a very long time at all. GBCs are generally released towards the end of the month. For example, this month, GBCs were mass released on *December 22nd and will likely retire on December 31st. 
<br><sub>*JN says they were released on December 19th because that is when they were released in Future Fashions (FF) - you can read more about FF in the glossary!</sub><br><br>


Since they are not available for very long each month, many users tend to stock up a bit when they are released. If you think you may need to do a couple trades, I would recommend buying at least a few. 

<br><br>When you open a GBC, there is a slight chance that you will get a Limited Edition Gift Box! They look like this:
</p>

<p class="text-center">
<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_gb_fallingsnow.gif"><br><sub>-drools-</sub></p>

<p>
These Limited Edition Gift Boxes are quite rare. Unfortunately, like Basic Gift Boxes, you <b>cannot</b> trade them to another user by putting them inside a gift box. The only function LE gift boxes have is that they look pretty and they can be used to send items to another user (like a Basic Gift Box).

<h2>Values<span>-But... what is it worth?-</span></h2>

<div class="seventy">
<p>Values are tricky.
<br>First and foremost: Everyone is entitled to their own value opinion. Some users may value items higher or lower depending on how "HTPW" <b>(Hard To Part With)</b> an item is or how popular it may be at the time. Understandably, some items may increase in value during certain seasons - for example, while Hanging Winter Candle Garland isn't on everyone's priority wishlist in the middle of July, you can bet it's hard to find come December!</p>

<p><b>Generally,</b> the factors that influence values include:
<br>- <b>The Season:</b> Many traders customize their pets based on the current season/upcoming holiday.
<br>- <b>Original Cost:</b> A great example of this is Rosy Cheeks Face Paint. Rosy Cheeks Face Paint is buyable in the Mall, but only as the bonus item from the Flower Fun Superpack (which costs 550NC). This leads to its value being ~3.
<br>- <b>Aesthetics:</b> Generally speaking, items that are not visually appealing tend to have a lower value. 
<br>- <b>Rarity:</b> This is tricky, as it does not always apply - but, <i>generally speaking,</i> items that were hard to acquire and/or are few in existence tend to have a higher value. 
</p>

<p>In order to determine the value of an item, the easiest approach is using a <b>value guide.</b>
<br>The most commonly referenced guides as of September 2018 are:
<br><br>- <a href="/~Waka">/~Waka</a>: This is the most widely used value guide maintained by cupcakebakery, devin1211111, l_like_animals, and sigris. They've done a lot of work to gather data and keep the guide up-to-date. I would highly recommend using this guide :) 

<br>- <a href="/~Yadez">/~Yadez (previously ~Nidyra)</a>: This is a very important non-wearables value guide that was created by kelly_d60. Non-wearable items listed here include GBCs, event tickets/passes/packs, MCs, tokens, goodie bags, and more :) Since these items tend to trade infrequently, it is recommended to check this guide for past trades to get a better sense of what the item might be worth


<br>- <a href="/~juingo">/~Juingo</a>: This is a NeoHome item value guide (thanks for the link Cate!)
</p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/giftcard_thanks.gif"><br><sub>Thank you to all the value guide and database makers for all the hard work and time that goes into maintaining these pages for the community!</sub></p>

<p>
Value guides and NC traders will often refer to item values ranging from 1-100+. 
<br><b>This references the amount of GBCs the item is worth.</b>
<br>Remember, one GBC is worth 200NC (which is approximately $2 USD). 
<br>Another common symbol you may see is: ~ which means approximately.</p>

<p><b>For items that cost under 200NC (like Dyeworks Potions or Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies), their value is still considered as 1 capsule.</b> This is because it still requires the trader to use a gift box to send the item. Do not expect to receive two 100NC items for a single GBC or vice versa. Gift boxes cost money and the amount required for a trade should always be considered. </p>

<p>Let's practice: if an item is listed as ~3, how much neocash does that equal?
<br>Value of ~3 = ~3 GBCs
<br>3 GBCs = (200NC x 3)
<br>3 GBCs = 600NC
<br>Value of ~3 = ~600NC
</p>

<p>
Therefore, in order to trade for an item listed at ~3, you should expect to offer ~3 GBCs or item(s) that value ~3 GBCs/600NC.</p>

<p><b>Customs</b> are an offering of a certain amount of Neocash <b>which will be used to purchase and send</b> particular NC items that the trader wants from the NC Mall. For example, if you were trying to trade for an item that was listed at a 2-3 value, you could offer a "500NC custom" - which would be a 2.5 value. <b>If you are offering a custom, please ensure you have enough gift boxes to send the items!</b> I also recommend that you only purchase the items once you have confirmed the trade - this way you aren't stuck with them if the user declines the trade. Customs are popular during NC Mall events and when there are GBCs or new Collectors items (which sell for 250 NC) in the mall.</p>

<p>
Let's start with an example. Let's say you've found an item that you would like to find a trade for.</p>

<p class="text-center">
<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_acc_babybun.gif"><br><sub>Baby Bun with Heart Headband</sub></p>

<p>The next step would be to try on the item using Dress to Impress or JellyNeo's Wardrobe Previews. This will ensure that the item fits on your pet. Because this is an item for Baby pets, it can <b>only</b> be worn on pets painted Baby.</p>

<p>Now that we have determined the item fits and looks fab, let's determine the value for it.</p>

<p>According to the popular value guide, ~Waka, Baby Bun with Heart Headband has a value of ~3-4. 

</p><p>It is important to note that, even though GBCs are generally sought after, some users may not want to trade their item for GBCs or a custom - they may be seeking a specific item to item (item:item) trade. It is within their rights to reject fair offers - please do not be offended if this happens to you!</p>

<p>Another thing to keep in mind is the amount of gift boxes that will be required to transfer all the items when making a trade. To trade for an item worth ~7 in pure GBCs would mean sending 7 GBCs, therefore using 7 gift boxes. This would be referred to as "box heavy" - as it requires many gift boxes to complete the trade. <b>Some</b> users may offer discounts or may be willing to accept the lower value for their item if the trade requires many items/boxes for you to send. As previously stated, <b>everyone is entitled to their own value opinions</b> - whereas one user may love their Baby Bun with Heart Headband and value it at the full 4 value, others may be willing to part with it for 3 if it means 3 GBCs.</p>

<p>If an NC item is not listed on the value guides, it may be a new item - be sure to check JellyNeo to see if any new items have been released through the mall or an event! If you are concerned about an item's value, feel free to make a <b>Value Check Board</b> with the item name in title. Example: "Value Check: (Item Name)." Be sure to skim the first few pages of the NC Mall Chat board to see if there are any users who have already made a value check board for that item.</p>

<h2>Wishlists and Tradelists<span>-Hint: Traders love DTI!-</span></h2>
<div class="seventy">

<p>Wishlists and Tradelists are the foundation for making trades.
<br><b>Wishlists (WLs)</b> are used to list the items that you/the user <b>wants</b>
<br><b>Tradelists (TLs)</b> are used to list the items that you/the user is <b>willing to trade</b>.
</p>

<p>Some users make WLs on their PetPages or on fansites like Dress to Impress or JellyNeos Item Database. Other users use their gallery to show items they have up for trade.</p>
<p>Popular premade sites for PetPage WLs/TLs include:
<br>- <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Zerx#petp">Whitespace (Graveyard):</a> There is a great tradelist located in this Whitespace graveyard! 
<sub>*Shout out to Whitespace for the CSS for this guide!*</sub>
If you're looking for the current Whitespace site, you can find it <a href="/~Xaia">here</a>.
<br>- <a href="//www.neopets.com/~raeir">Anna's CSS:</a> The premade titled "Smoke and Mirrors" is very popular!
</p>

<p>The most common and preferred tools are JellyNeo and the Dress to Impress wishlist and tradelist creator. 
<br>This is because they actually allow you to separate items into specific categories, make categories private/public, list the quantity of items you have, write descriptions, and, perhaps most importantly, <b>compare</b> items you have on your wishlist and tradelist with another user. Be sure to check out both and use whichever tool you're more comfortable with :)
<br><br>One important difference is that DTI does not allow users to list/search for non-wearable items (such as cupcakes, cookies, or capsules). Some DTI users may list these in their descriptions instead.</p>

<p class="text-center">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/hBt7ql4.png"><br><sub>The categories listed in the Track section show the categories I have made for my items. 
<br>Source: DTI
</sub></p>

<p>This picture shows the typical display of an item lookup on DTI. These numbers can be used as a <b>general</b> gauge of an item's popularity. Based on the information above, the Antique Chic Christmas Foreground is likely to be a fairly popular item, as more users are seeking the item (25) than have it listed up for trade (16).</p>

<p class="text-center"><sub><b>I took that screenshot back in 2015-2016. Since then, this foreground has gone up significantly in value! Check out the current statistics for this item on DTI now to see how much it has changed :)</b></sub></p>

<p>Also, remember that some NC items are viewed as junky. Most of the "junky" items are items that have been in the NC Mall for a long time and have not been retired (leading to a lot being in circulation from opening GBCs), are from the list of free items that you get from redeeming NC cards, are from goodie bags from the Mall, and other items that are just kind of hideous xD. Unfortunately, <i>most</i> items that you may have gotten from the Money Tree are likely to be junk as well - it'd be rare for a person to donate a reasonably valuable item! As a <b>general</b> rule, if there is a very large discrepancy between the amount of people with the item and the amount of people seeking the item, it is likely that the item will be hard to trade away. An example of this is Pink Plaid Coat - which has a whopping 292 users with it up for trade and no one seeking it. </p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_coat_pinkplaid.gif"><br><sub>I'm not very popular at all :(</sub></p>

<p>Also, the DTI item page shows the specific DTI users with the item up for trade and/or who are seeking the item. If you were seeking this item, you could click on a person with the item up for trade and view their wishlist to see if you have anything that they want. The comparison tool is extremely useful for filtering long lists of items to find items you are seeking/trading. 
</p>

<p class="text-center">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/EZfvkAe.png"><br><sub>Click the big green comparison button to compare your items to another user!
<br>Source: DTI</sub></p>

<p>This tool allows wishlists and tradelists to go from being a long list of items to few key items you own/want - as long as you are logged in and have made a WL/TL on DTI.
</p>

<p>Be sure to read a user's description on their DTI page/Tradelist before making an offer on their items. Some users may have items in their <b>closet</b> that are not up for trade, or that are only up for trade for certain items. <br><b>Closet</b> is a general categorization of items that are frequently/currently in use or items that the user really likes and would have a difficult time trading away. </p>

<p>I would also encourage users to refrain from creating long lists of rules for trading (which can feel patronizing) and from putting items and/or gifts in their public DTI tradelist that they never intend to trade.</p>

<p>When you make a new list on DTI, you can specify whether it is: 
<br><b>- Public:</b> Anyone who looks up your items (specifically) can see this list. This means that the items will show up when a person directly views your DTI lists, however: your username will not appear on the item lookup pages. 
<br><b>- Trading:</b> Items in this list will be publicly listed for trades. In addition to being public, your username will appear on the item lookup for the item as a user with the item up for trade or as a user who wants the item (as appears in the previous screenshot for the Antique Chic Christmas Foreground). 
<br><b>- Private:</b> Only you can see this list. If you'd like somewhere to keep track of the items you own and do not want to trade, use a private list!
<br>Once you have created a list, you can change whether it is public, trading, or private by clicking the drop-down menu to the left of the list title. Remember: The change will affect all items in the list. 

</p><p>In order to save yourself some boxes and heartache, I would recommend ensuring that you only trade for items that you really want and/or will use. Creating customizations on DTI in advance can be extremely helpful for this! Be sure to check out a great customization guide at <a href="/~Neocash">/~Neocash</a> for instructions, advice and recommendations for your customizations! 

</p><p>Once you have a wishlist and tradelist, you are well on your way to trading. If you are merely seeking a few items and are only offering customs/GBCs, then it may not be necessary to create a WL/TL. However, they do help to keep track of the items you can offer once you have a few!</p>

<h2>Boards and Trade Etiquette<span>-Guidelines for Navigating the NC Mall Board-</span></h2>

<div class="seventy">
<p>Now that you know the item you want, what it's worth, and what you can offer for it - let's take a look at the NC marketplace - the NC Mall Neoboard!</p>

<p>The NC Mall Neoboard, often abbreviated to NCC, may seem like a strange and scary place at first. There are all these titles with weird abbreviations, numbers, emotes, and symbols. The first time I saw a title that said "S: DWs, SS, and GBCs! | O: 2:1 GBC Sale, FQC, TL" I thought I had entered the Matrix. But trust me - you'll come to learn the abbreviations quickly! Here's a quick run down of the most common abbreviated terms. A more thorough list of popular item abbreviations will appear in the Glossary section of this guide.</p>

<p><b>WL:</b> Wishlist 
<br><b>TL:</b> Tradelist
<br><b>S:</b> Seeking - this will be followed by the item(s) the person wants.
<br><b>O:</b> Offering - this will be followed by the item(s) the person is willing to trade.
<br><b>T:</b> Trading - like offering, this will be followed by the item(s) the person is willing to trade.
<br><b>ISO:</b> In Search Of - like seeking, this will be followed by the item(s) the person wants.
<br><b>Closet:</b> - This denotes a user's items that are frequently/currently in use and/or items that the user really likes and would have a difficult time trading away.
<br><b>Customs:</b> A custom is an offering of a certain amount of Neocash, which will be used to purchase and send particular NC items that the trader wants from the NC Mall. For example, if you are seeking an item that has a ~2-3 GBC value, you can offer a 500NC custom (which is equal to 2.5 value). This would require you to purchase and send items that the trader wants from the NC mall that total 500NC. It is recommended that you only purchase the items once the trade has been confirmed - this way you aren't stuck with the items if the user declines the trade! Be sure that you have enough boxes to send the the items before confirming the trade.
<br><b>BG:</b> Background
<br><b>FG:</b> Foreground
<br><b>GL:</b> Garland (or Good Luck)
<br><b>FP:</b> Face paint/Facepaint
<br><b>MU:</b> Makeup
<br><b>PC:</b> Premium Collectible - these are items given to Premium members each month.
<br><b>FQC/FQFC:</b> Faerie Quest Cookies/Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies - these are often available in the NC Mall for 100 NC. 
<br><b>Lab Cookies:</b> Lab Ray Fortune Cookies - these are often available in the NC Mall for 125 NC. 
<br><b>Archives Cookies:</b> NC Archives Fortune Cookies - these are often available in the NC Mall for 225 NC.
<br><b>Upcycle Cookies:</b> NC Upcycle Fortune Cookies - these are often available in the NC Mall for 175 NC.
<br><b>GBC:</b> Gift Box Capsule
<br><b>2:1:</b> Two for One - this references a GBC sale. The person is offering TWO of their items in exchange for ONE of your GBCs. Now, this certainly seemed strange for me when I first began trading - <i>why would anyone do this?</i> I thought. The typical reason why people do 2:1 sales is because they want gift boxes - remember: GBCs do have a chance at giving away more than 2 boxes - even though it is a slim chance, some users are hoping they will get lucky and get three or more boxes! Also, the items they are likely trading in exchange for a GBC are likely items that they do not like/will never use, that are junk, or that they have extras of. Some users have so many extra items that they are happy to be rid of them! Also, some users may be trying to get a Limited Edition gift box by opening the GBC that you will send them. If you do engage in 2:1 sales, be aware that it is common for users to need to accept the GBC first before they can send your items. 
<br><b>DW:</b> Dyeworks - A trader referring to "DW" in their title/board may be referring to the Dyeworks Hue Brew Potions (which are buyable in the NC Mall for 125 NC) or to specific Dyeworks items. PLEASE read the section on Dyeworks located at the end of the Glossary for a more thorough explanation of Dyeworks!</p>


<p><b>Now onto trading!</b> I will presume from here that you know what item you are seeking, you have an idea of what you will offer to trade for it, and you are comfortable with the values for these items.
<br>First, I recommend skimming the front page of the NC Mall Chat (often abbreviated to NCC) to see if anyone has the item you are seeking listed in their board title. If you can't find it, feel free to make your own board! 
</p>

<p>To start, put what you are seeking in the board title. Many users have titles such as:</p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2A8RkI7.png"><br><sub>Seeking: (Item Name) and More!. Offering: (Item Name), GBCs, TL!</sub></p>

<p>This allows users to quickly zone in on your board if they see you are offering something they want, or if they have what you want. </p>

<p>In the first post you should repost/include all the items you want, in case you couldn't fit them all in the title. Be sure to list the exact name of each item so no one gets confused! You can also post a link to your wishlist/tradelist if it is on a petpage or a fansite. I also highly recommend having a line break between links (especially to DTI or JN) to make it easier for people to copy and paste the link into their browser:</p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Tfm3KEi.png"><br><sub>First post</sub></p>

<p>If you are a new trader, I would suggest that you <b>end your first post by asking users to post instead of neomail.</b> Posts only, please!" or "No neomails, please!" is a polite way to say it. Asking users to post their offer on the board (thereby making it public) will hold them a bit more accountable for the trades and offers they make to you. Most traders are really sweet and kind to newcomers, but there is nothing worse than getting taken advantage of - so hopefully this will discourage that!</p>

<p>If you feel comfortable negotiating trades over neomail, the community tends to appreciate a direct link to your neomail on the board. This is due to the implementation of captchas, which make it really tedious to access userlookups and the direct mail link. Here's the direct link (be sure to change the username!): <br>//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=USERNAME
</p>

<p>The NC Mall board moves pretty fast, so be prepared to bump your board every 5-10 minutes (depending on the time of day and chaos on the boards) to keep it on the front page!</p>

<p><b>Etiquette Tip:</b> Be sure to read carefully how users value their closet items before offering on them! If a user says their closet items are never up for trade, do not offer on them. If a user says their closet items are only up for trade for x, y, or z - only offer x, y, or z. </p>

<p><b>Etiquette Tip:</b> Be fair when negotiating offers! It is generally seen as a faux pas to value another user's item at the lower end while valuing your equivalent item at the higher end value. 

</p><p>If a user posts an offer that you would like to accept, tell them you would like to do the trade and be sure to ask them where they would like the item sent! Some traders may want the item sent to their side account or to a friend. In that post, you can also include where you would like the item they are sending to you. </p>

<p>Here's an example of a common response you can use to a trade offer:
<br><i>I can do that trade, (username/name)! Where would you like the (item name) sent? I'd love the (item name) here, please!</i>
<br>Here refers to the account you are currently posting from. Be sure you are on the right account or to specify the username you would like your items sent to!</p>

<p>Another great tip (thanks Vikki!) is to copy (ctrl + c) and paste (ctrl + v) the username you are sending the item to. It's really easy to mistake i's for l's or 1's. Use this tip to ensure you're sending the item to the exact username specified by the trader!</p>

<p><b>Etiquette Tip:</b> It is expected that you do <b>NOT</b> accept any NC item sent to you <b>until</b> you have sent the user all of their requested items. Unless the user specifies that they need to accept first (which may happen in the case of GBCs - as they may need to open the capsule first to obtain a box in order to send the item to you), it is widely viewed as rude to accept first without sending. Rest assured, you will receive a confirmation neomail from TNT when a user accepts a gift that you have sent.</p>

<p><b>Etiquette Tip:</b> It is customary that you <b>copy and paste the delivery message</b> and post it on the board after you have sent an item in a trade to another user. Remember, the delivery message is the one that states: 
<br>Congratulations! Your gift has been delivered to (username). You will receive a Neomail updating you on the status of your gift within 48 hours. Thank you.
<br>Yes, the message could be "faked" but it is still viewed as a polite custom to show publicly that you have sent the item! 
</p>

<p><b>Caution:</b> Be very cautious when considering a three-way trade. A three way trade would be like: Person A sends an item to person B who sends an item to person C who sends an item to person A. If you are a beginner to NC trading, I would highly advise you not to engage in this type of trade. Three way trades can get confused very easily and lead to items being sent to the wrong place or not sent at all. Even as a seasoned trader myself, I would not engage in a three-way trade unless I personally knew the individuals or recognized them as trustworthy and experienced with trading. Never let anyone pressure you into a trade!</p>


<p>In the event that you send a person their item (and they accepted it) but they did not send you your item - do not panic. Accidents, natural disasters, technical issues, and more are very common - and have even happened to me in the middle of a trade! I would only suggest reporting the user after 48 hours. In the report, include details, links, or screenies of the posts made that clearly outline the trade. <b>Do not</b> make a board publicly accusing a user of stealing/scamming - this could get you in trouble. It is very rare that people attempt to steal other user's items, so rare that I myself have never actually seen it happen. More often than not - something serious came up, the person lost internet access, or their power went out. Be patient and trust in the community and TNT to ensure the safe trading of your items!

<hr><h2>Quick Tips</h2>
<div class="seventy">
<p class="text-center">Here is a quick review of all the main tips and concepts to keep in mind while trading:</p>
<p>
<br>● Do your research! Look up the items you are seeking/offering on DTI, JellyNeo, and the value guides (see bookmarks tab for links) to ensure you know enough about the item before trading (for) it. 
<br>● Try on items using DTI to ensure they fit on your pet properly before trading for them.
<br>● Make sure you have enough gift boxes before confirming a trade! Each item you send (aside from a few specialty items like grams) will require a gift box to send it in. 
<br>● Items worth less than 200NC (such as Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies or Dyeworks Potions) are still considered as having a 1 capsule value. This is because they still require a gift box to send them. It wouldn't be fair to <b>expect</b> someone to use four gift boxes to send you 4 FQCs for your single Sparkler Cupcake!
<br>● GBCs are not always available in the mall. They tend to be available for the last 1-2 weeks of the month.
<br>● When you make a board, at the end of your first post say "posts only, please!" or "no neomails, please!" to ensure that people post offers on your board instead of neomailing them to you. This will hold them more accountable for the offers they make to you.
<br>● Specify the full name of the item you are seeking/trading on your board. Many items have similar names and it can be easy to get them confused.
<br>● Be sure to read through a person's wishlist/tradelist carefully before making an offer. Some items may be listed as not up for trade in a person's closet - it would be rude to offer on these items!
<br>● Ask the user where they would like the item sent before sending the item. Copy and paste the username to ensure it does not get sent to the wrong place. 
<br>● Be courteous and fair! It is seen as a faux pas to value your items at the high-end of the value and a trader's equivalent item at the lower-end value. 
<br>● Lastly - and most importantly! - do not accept any NC item sent to you <b>until</b> you have sent the user all of their requested items. It is seen as very rude to do this! 
</p>

<hr><h2>The End!</h2>

<br><p>Remember - this is just a guide! Items may change, value guides may change, everything could change! Do not treat this as law. I don't claim to be the most seasoned NC trader, I merely decided to make this guide as an updated version to help newcomers navigate the world of NC trading. When I started out, I was completely overwhelmed with the complexity of it all. I hope this can help someone out there, even if just a little!</p>

<br><br><b>Box Heavy:</b> This is a type of trade that requires a user to send multiple items and use multiple gift boxes.

<br><br><b>Cookies:</b> May refer to Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies, Lab Ray Cookies, Upcycle Cookies, Archives Cookies, and more.
<br><br><b>Cupcakes:</b> Refers to 8th Birthday Rainbow/Sparkler/Tied with a Bow Cupcake. These were released on the NC Mall's 8th Birthday and, like cake, will increase certain BD stats of a pet that consumes it. <i>Caution:</i> The new 9th birthday cupcakes are not tradeable. It is not yet clear as to whether this is intentional or a glitch. 
<br><br><b>Customs:</b> A custom is an offering of a certain amount of Neocash, which will be used to purchase and send particular NC items that the trader wants from the NC Mall. For example, if you are seeking an item that has a ~2-3 GBC value, you can offer a 500NC custom (which is equal to 2.5 value). This would require you to purchase and send items that the trader wants from the NC mall that total 500NC. It is recommended that you only purchase the items once the trade has been confirmed - this way you aren't stuck with the items if the user declines the trade! Be sure that you have enough boxes to send the the items before confirming the trade.
<br><br><b>Closet:</b> Items in use/used frequently that are likely either HTPW or may not be up for trade.
<br><br><b>DD:</b> Daily Dare
<br><br><b>DTI:</b> Dress to Impress - This is a very popular fansite that allows users to create customizations for their pets using the complete database of wearable items. It also has useful functions that allow users to create their own wishlists and tradelists and find users seeking or trading specific items.
<br><br><b>DW:</b> Dyeworks - This may refer to the Dyeworks Hue Brew Potions which sell in the NC Mall for 125 NC, or to specific items that have been/are available to dye in the Dyeworks studio. See the in-depth explanation at the end of this guide and an even more detailed guide of Dyeworks at <a href="//www.neopets.com/~katti">/~Katti</a> for more information!
<br><br><b>EB:</b> Elite Boutique - This section of the NC Mall is open to users who have accounts 49 months or older. These items <i>cannot</i> be traded.
<br><br><b>FF:</b> Future Fashions - This is a special section of the NC Mall that is opened for 1 month to users who have spent over 10,000NC in the previous month. It gives them early access (by 72 hours) to items that will be released. 
<br><br><b>FG: </b>Foreground
<br><br><b>FP: </b>Face Paint/Facepaint

<br><br><b>HTPW:</b> Hard to Part With
<br><br><b>ISO:</b> In Search Of - like seeking, this will be followed by the item(s) the person wants.
<br><br><b>JJPB:</b> Jubjub Power Bounce
<br><br><b>JN:</b> JellyNeo - This fansite is used by some traders to create wishlists and tradelists. It is also useful as a repository of information on NC items, which can be accessed within the item database and general event/item guides. 
<br><br><b>Junk:</b> Items that are exceedingly common with hundreds in circulation are typically considered junky. This may include items that have been in the NC Mall for a long time and have not been retired (leading to a lot being in circulation from opening GBCs), items from the list of free items that you get from redeeming NC cards, items from free goodie bags from the Mall, and other items that are just kind of hideous. Because they are so common and/or unwanted, it may be difficult to find someone who is seeking these items.
<br><br><b>KQ Token:</b> Key Quest Token - These tokens, when opened, provide a bonus NC item and (previously) a Key Quest character that could be used in-game. Even though Key Quest is down, these tokens will still provide their bonus item once they are opened. 
<br><br><b>LE:</b> Limited Edition
<br><br><b>LF:</b> Looking For
<br><br><b>MC:</b> Mystery Capsule - When opened, these capsules will provide you with one (or possibly more) item at random from a list of possible items. JellyNeo is great for collecting a list of the items that can be obtained from MCs. Some mystery capsules may also have the chance of awarding a bonus item as well. Some MCs may contain new items or retired items. Be warned: In the case of Retired MCs, trying to open many in the hopes of acquiring a single, specific item can be very expensive. This is because there is usually a long list of items that the retired mystery capsule can give out, making your chances of getting the item 1:20 or even worse. I have even heard that someone opened <i>45</i> retired MCs trying to get a specific item and had no luck! 
<br><br><b>MME:</b> Mysterious Morphing Experiment. These items begin as a single object and will morph into new objects. They are typically buyable in the NC mall for a few weeks and, once they retire from the mall, they will begin morphing. Once the MME has <i>completed</i> morphing, all of the stages it had morphed into will appear in your inventory. See the end of this glossary for more information!
<br><br><b>NC:</b> Neocash 
<br><br><b>NM:</b> Neomail
<br><br><b>O:</b> Offering
<br><br><b>PC:</b> Premium Collectible - These are items designed for and given free to Premium-subscribed users each month. A subscribed user will only receive one premium collectible per month.  PC items cannot be bought in the NC Mall and can only be obtained by having/purchasing a Premium membership. A subscribed user will receive the new item that is available for that specific "month". Month is in quotations here because the PC items do not follow the calendar months - they are typically released mid month (the 15th) and will retire the following month by the 14th.
<br><br><b>Populars:</b> Popular Items 
<br><br><b>PP:</b> Patapult
<br><br><b>Pre-trade:</b> Prearranging a trade - This is often done prior to the release of GBCs.
<br><br><b>Ret.:</b> Retired
<br><br><b>RR:</b> Re-release - This typically refers to items that were previously retired and now made available as a prize from a mystery capsule. Examples of mystery capsules that reward re-released/retired items upon opening include: Sweet Summertime Retired Mystery Capsule and NC Mall 9th Birthday Mystery Capsule. Check JellyNeo for a list of items that can be obtained from mystery capsules.
<br><br><b>S:</b> Seeking
<br><br><b>SL:</b> String Lights - Populars that it may refer to include: Flowering Vine String Lights, MiniMME14-B: Cherry Blossom String Lights, Charming Halloween String Lights, Limited Edition- Holiday Star String Lights, Sunflower String Lights, or Luminous Pumpkin String Lights.
<br><br><b>SP:</b> Super Pack - These provide multiple items when opened. The bonus item that a super pack provides will be provided upon opening the super pack. These bonus items will not appear as buyable/searchable in the NC mall (ex. Rosy Cheeks Face Paint).

<p>
<br><b>MME:</b> Mysterious Morphing Experiment. These items begin as a single object and will morph into new objects. They are typically buyable in the NC mall for a few weeks and, once they retire from the mall, they will begin morphing. Once the MME has <i>completed</i> morphing, all of the stages it had morphed into will appear in your inventory. </p>
<p>MiniMMEs have 2 stages (so only morphing once), with the chance to receive a bonus item. Normal MMEs can have anywhere from 4-7 stages, with the chance to receive a bonus item. MMEs also have different "paths" (for lack of a better word) that determine the items that they provide.

This shows the stages and differences between them for the three different "paths"/ID numbers that were available. The background was the bonus item.
</sub></p>
<p>
MiniMMEs typically have 3 different paths, while regular MMEs typically have 2. The path the MME takes is dependent on the ID number it has. For example, with MME19, we can see that one ID number was more girl-themed (providing a long haired wig and a dress), and the second was more male-themed (providing a tunic and a short haired wig). Some items may be the same for both MMEs (like the starting item) and some may be unique to each ID. </p>

<p>This means that if you want all of the possible items from an MME, you will need to have one MME of each ID. Be aware that getting the bonus item is not guaranteed, each MME only has a chance to receive it - which can range from approximately 10-30% from previous informal calculations that I can recall.</p>

<p>
Finding the ID number of an MME is a bit complicated, so I highly recommend <a href="/~Sitiu">checking out /~Sitiu</a> for more information :) </p>

<p><i>Caution: It is highly recommended to not trade an MME once it has begun morphing.</i> There have been cases where users have traded an MME in the middle of the morph and the original owner received some of the items and the new owner received some as well.


<br><br><b>DW:</b> Dyeworks - I've saved this for last because I want to give a brief explanation of how Dyeworks works (see what I did there) since they are so popular. A trader referring to "DW" in their title/board may be referring to the Dyeworks Hue Brew Potions (which are buyable in the NC Mall for 125 NC) or to specific Dyeworks items. Dyeworks items are recoloured versions of an original item:

</p>

<p class="text-center">
<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_blum_blueleafgar.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_fg_winterrose.gif"><br><sub>^Originals:
<br>Peaceful Tree Garland and Winter Rose Foreground</sub><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_gar_peacefultreepurp.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_gar_peacefultreebrwn.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_gar_peacefultreepink.gif"><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_fg_winterrose_dyeorange.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_fg_winterrose_dyepurple.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_fg_winterrose_dyewhite.gif"><br><sub>^Recolours:
<br>Dyeworks Purple/Yellow/Pink: Peaceful Tree Garland
<br>Dyeworks Orange/Purple/White: Winter Rose Foreground</sub></p>

<p>If you have an original item that has been given a recolouring, you can take it to the Dyeworks studio and, using a Dyeworks Potion, <b>create a copy of it</b> that will appear in one of the available colours!
<br>It is important to note that you <b>cannot</b> choose which Dyeworks recolour you will receive - it is random. 
<br>It is important to note that some Dyeworks items <b>retire</b>. Some items, like the Peaceful Tree Garland, are always (for now) available to dye. Most items, however, are only available for about a month after they are released. This includes the Winter Rose Foreground. This means that you are only allowed to dye the Winter Rose Foreground within the time frame before it retires. Once the Dyeworks are "retired" - you will be unable to dye them. Be sure that you check the Dyeworks list of items <a href="//www.neopets.com/mall/dyeworks/">here</a> to ensure the item you want to dye is available.</p>

<p>If a user states that they are <b>lending</b> Dyeworks items - this means they have an original item (like Peaceful Tree Garland) and will lend it to you to dye. Many traders will often lend a Dyeworks original item in exchange for a GBC. Borrowing an item means you get to keep the dyed copies of the item you create in the Dyeworks studio (which require you to use Dyeworks Potions), but you must <b>return</b> the original item to the lender. <b>Warning:</b> Be sure you have enough gift boxes to send the item for the lend (such as the GBC) AND to return the original item back to the lender!</p>

<p>Please check out <a href="//www.neopets.com/~katti">this amazing guide</a> by Kat for more information on Dyeworks, recent trades/values, and the release dates!
