<h1>TNT RULE CHANGE TO COMMISSIONS PETITION</h1>


<br>Allow artists, writers, HTML coder, graphic's creatives to sell their work for in game items/neopoints.
<br><br><b>Why?</b>
<br><b>1.</b> Creative communities allow for a massive interest back into Neopets in a ton of ways. For those who wish to earn a new way of making an income on the website while engaging with the community they love, and a way for other players to support others and spoil your pets. Art of all manners takes time, and as most of us are adults our free time would like to have some sort of compensation.
<br><br><b>2.</b> Other sucessful websites such as Gaiaonline, Flight Rising, Dappervolk ect allow the exchange of art in their communities and helps strengthen interest in the website overall. Players both new and old will have a larger interest in engaging with neopets if its creative community extended beyond just the beauty contest.
<br><br><b>3. </b>Letting users set up their art shops will have a higher chance of extending interest to the roleplay community, html coding community, and other creative games on Neopets as a whole. With something to do and provide players, this most likely will get the art chat booming again.
<br><br><b>4.</b> Art creatives are the easiest way to spread the word about Neopets. With artists having higher incentives to run shops in the artchat, this will attract new players, especially if many advertise off-website.

<br><br><b>Issues</b>
<br>
The number one concern people and staff have is regulation and scammers, which, its no lie this cannot be regulated even with the small number of forum staff who most likely don't have the time. Short answer? <b>Leave that up to the community to regulate.</b>
<br><br>With the current trading post system, its not ideal to send items for people in exchange for a good that may or may not appear. But a good solution to make sure that these stay as honest as possible, is to create a trading system that allows both parties involved to accept the trade.
<br><br>Art is labor, and lots of players time and time again want a new way to engage with neopets and there are others who would love to use their neopoints and items to aid to finding new ways to spoil their neopets.
<br><br>

<br><b>narutoluvr935</b>i think it'd help incentivize artists who typically can't or don't do requests to be able to draw for people on here
bc lemme be honest; i love drawing people's pets but at the same time..
drawing my own art is enough of a time commitment
<br><br><b>riverthistle</b> I really like that you make it obvious that this change would be mutually beneficial to both users and the site itself. I think allowing commissions would be a great move, especially given the level of inflation and how difficult it is to afford paint brushes, morphing potions, etc now. Like you said, it'll increase interest and engagement, and the only downside is the risk of getting scammed but that happens everywhere else on here anyway lol
<br><br><b>
saqo</b>
<br><br><b>staryanna</b> and agree w let it be self regulated,, its a bit different when u take IRL cash for comms, but imo i wouldnt be too hard pressed about loosing out on some NP, if say i got scammed out of a NP comm, i can always earn more,, its not irl cash at the end of the day,, like it would suck but, its np??? let it happen,, itll help boost the art and creative communities in here. itll be an actual decent source of NP for us creative folks,, vs hoping and praying we get accepted into a creative contest, and then again hoping and praying when we check out inv its a decent enough prize to sell,, not a 1000np petpet bleh!

<br><br><b>nick_and_nickette</b> The Art Chat goes dead after Fridays... Allowing comissions would be something that would keep it alive all week and would be a fun way to enjoy playing Neo, imo, especially to those of us who don't do anything else on the site nowadays aside from enter the creative contests.
<br><br><b>kaitouthiefdark</b> I know an argument against this is that NP/Items don't have a "real life value" but that's not true. Sure, you can make + - 1 Million NP in a day just from Food Club but a lot of time goes into getting valuable items and NP and that alone gives it a lot of value. Most sites settle on a USD / "NP" conversion anyway and it isn't enforced by the site. People hoard a lot of items/np and its causing a stagnation in the economy - A lot of people just don't have anything they really want to buy rn or can't due to price - Allowing Commissions could revitalize things. It would also bring people that don't enter the BC or draw to come here. There isn't much reason for a non artist to come to the Art Chat. So the Art chat gets lonely after Friday.
<br><br><b>tranquilibrium</b> Fully agreed. FR has such an active, fun and amazing art community and I really miss that vibe here. The art chat has been in decline for activity for years now - after fridays, its dead. This will incentivize individuals who normally wouldn't come to the Art Chat to drop in more and would just create overall more activity here. I definitely think its looking into, even if we can't exchange USD we should be able to exchange 
np/nc/items.
<br><br><b>playfulfox</b> I think this is a wonderful idea and it's easy to see the huge benefits it would have for everyone. Thank you for making this page!
<br><br><b>xmereana</b>
<br><br><b>njcely</b> I think it would help revitalize the economy by giving users another avenue to both make AND spend neopoints. It seems like nowadays the only way to generate an income is through food club, stocks, and the battledome - which can all be done within an hour. Neopians can support the artists, writers, and coders that make up an important part of the Neopets community.
<br><br><b>iseewhatyoudidthar</b>
<br><br><b>Gunjii</b> Every other site on the planet allows for this. The creative communities in a lot of these places drive much of the market and continued interest in these sites. It gives those who can't draw, code or etc something to proudly display while also giving the artists and etc something to do. Anyone worried about scamming has to look at this in the way of, has not having something stopped any sort of scamming on this site? Having a way to recycle and move np between players is something this site has been really missing for ages and this would be a great way to do it.
<br><br><b>zombifies</b> the site is stagnating, the art chat is sad. This would make the site more interesting and appealing to artists and interested parties alike.
<br><br><b>hemocastle</b>
I would love this to be true! I am on student Visa in the states for YEARS that does not allow me to do commission for real currency at all, so I've never had chances to even -try- art-selling as long as I am living in the U.S haha, so I do appreciate to be at least able to get pay in virtual currency and actually experience doing it professionally like a "paid" job more somehow xD
<br><br><b>chasing_stars44</b>
 I think it would be a great way to revitalize the art chat. It'd bring people in, both artists and commissioners. And the artists on here are a pretty strong community, I trust them to self regulate.
<br><br><b>wolfycries104</b>
add my name to the page!!! im all for commissions on neo, especially in our current climate where restockers inflate the prices of coveted items to insane extents. if i could open an art shop on neo i would be 10x more involved on the art boards!
<br><br><b>sliver_tooth</b>
Id absolutely love to be able to earn some np for my art. It would defintely increase the amount of art i do for people too, art trades are fine but i dont enjoy them as much as i used to
<br><br><b>kingfredpaw</b> I am not the best artist and would love to be able to commission people for art of my pets tbh, it would give me a solid reason to save up and interact with the art side of neopets more
<br><br><b>nukacolas</b>
<br><br><b>
gothicxmaiden</b>Love and support this!! I find that a ton of Neopians are interested in art in one way or another anyway so I think this is a fantastic way to engage a LOT of people on the site and also a nice avenue to (hopefully) make the Neo economy not so terrible XD
<br><br><b>harpengerofdeath</b> I'm signing enthusiastically as a Neopian artist who would love the opportunity to be compensated for art done for others on this site even if it was just with in game currency! The fact that it's not already allowed is astonishing to me tbh. It would def help with revitalizing the site!
<br><br><b>dollcollector</b>
 I would love to be able to commission fanart on this site. I think it would be great since I want art of my pets, but I don't have the time to do it because of work and lack of inspiration. And I want to keep my dignity instead of making boards begging for fanart of my pet or make half put together pieces for 'art trades'.

<br><br><b>tiny_mouse_400</b>
<br><br><b>luke1200000</b>
<br><br><b>aurorawolf106</b>  I support the idea! I'd love to see new life in the art community here :')
<br><br><b>sunbathr</b>
<br><br><b>purple_articuno</b> please TNT this could revitalize both the site's economy a bit and the (nearly dead) art community here
<br><br><b>jojoez95</b> Definitely agree, I would like to see a revitalization of the art community on here. This place sometimes feel like a shell of what it used to be.
<br><br><b>hidden_artist</b>I would love that! it'd be a great way to boost the creativity of the fan base. I'd totally pay NP for a commission
<br><br><b>snofoxe</b>
<br><br><b>nicole1251</b> This is soooo needed omg! I think Neopets is the only petsite that doesn't allow this??? I majorly support this. Neopets has a huge community of artists, crafters and writers. It's mind-blowing that this is not a thing yet. I think it would bring a ton of life to the site for a lot of reasons. But especially for folks that can't draw and would love to see their pets drawn. I can draw and I would STILL love to commission people, I just love love LOOOVE seeing my pets drawn in other people's style! Even just talking about this MAYBE being a possibility is getting me excited haha! Gosh I hope this can be a thing someday.
<br><br><b>diabolically_yours</b> They allow pet trading. That used to be something strictly forbidden. Why not allow NP/item compensation in exchange for artwork?

1) It's a great way for artists to feel appreciated for their efforts, and to become known beyond the AC.
2) It could boost the Neo economy. Inflation is crazy, and we don't really have good ways of earning NP's right now aside from FC.
3) Neo would be less boring. xD
<br><br><b>blackforest_wolf</b> i am deifnitely supporting this, as np earning is quite hard for those who does not rs. as an artist, i know how long and how much work is put into each piece. allowing commissions = acknowledging our hard work ^^ regarding the issue of being scammed; i've rarely had that happen to me, as a commissioner or as an artist luckily! just make sure to watermark the work until you receive full payment c:
<br><br><b>kikyo_dark_angel</b> I been off Neopets for a long time so I dont know how 100% the trading post work or what are their issues at the moment, but I think commisions would be a great way to bring people back to the game as it will allow them to make NP and achieve their goals if they couldnt proceed with the usual methods (I, for example, cannot understand for the life of me the food club or the stock market)
<br><br><b>muffineagle</b>
<br><br><b>popy153</b>not only would adding this feature benefit artists/writers/coders/etc but it would also bring more attention to the site!
<br><br><b>
shellshocks</b>FR was actually the first site I ever tried taking commissions on, and while I do PWYW due to inability to have firm prices, I admit...I actually enjoyed it. I don't get many requests and art trades are my preference overall, but I wouldn't say no to an expensive item or something being exchanged for a piece of art (well, if Neo allowed it). If anything, I'd much rather take commission requests compared to freebies while not doing art trades. My desire to practice made me reopen offsite, tbh.
<br><br><b>
topatee</b> I don't really have anything to add that hasn't been said already, but I am 100% on board with this and would be absolutely thrilled if np commissions were allowed. I'd definitely spend more time online_ as opposed to the few minutes I take to do dailies each day, and I also think it would be great for more user interaction above just bc spam when the contest resets each week. Count me in!
<br><br><b>strangespectre</b> It sounds like a wonderful idea that'd be beneficial to both the users and the site! It'd be wonderful to breathe some more life and activity into the art and creation communities on here imo. Especially since I've seen others saying the various art communities have been shrinking- which is a shame since many people are so creative! I also think it'd be pretty good for the economy because to be honest? It's kind of a mess with all the price inflation and item hoarding. It'd be wonderful to give others a source to get something they'd love to get for their pets! As for scams? It kinda happens everywhere, and while it does stink, at least it won't be in exchange for actual money, and I'm pretty sure the users would gladly try to make sure everyone stays safe from scammers.
<br><br><b>5nn5nn5</b> 100% wanna pledge my support on this. I play other online sim games and in all of those I work with commissions just fine. This is a great opportunity to not only keep artists more active but to bring more people interested in art chat in general. (And last but not least would encourage people to support artists instead of just using AI like recently  )
<br><br><b>valethra</b>
<br><br><b>remlyn</b>I think this is an excellent idea!
<br><br><b>coolkaius</b> NP commissions would also make things a lot more fair for people with younger accounts, giving them a chance to make a lot of NP. I know of another 2000s online game where these types of commissions are commonplace. I encourage TNT to ask more players about this, especially those who aren't artists for their thoughts. Commissions create a mutually beneficial exchange. It would encourage cooperation from artists and other players to share wealth and creativity.

<br><br><b>i_have_a_vampire</b>
<br><br><b>waelgaest</b> very much agree that this would help to revitalize the art community as well as the struggling np economy
<br><br><b>snorlaxa</b>  I totally love and support this idea! The art community on neo has so much potential! I've seen so many great works and I'd love to see them being more encouraged ^^ This could also be a nice motivation to lazy people (like me ) to get back to work hehe
<br><br><b>noir_chamois</b> Very interesting!!! I can do a lot of artwork for this!!
<br><br><b>thelyinglark</b>
<br><br><b>blaze12391</b> On a personal note, would be super helpful to those of us artists that don't have time for/can't wrap our heads around restocking and food club and all that stuff (maybe that's just me idk) to have a more steady way to earn their goals! Would also help people that aren't artists but also can't do formal money commissions for whatever reason (who would have to go offsite for it anyway) to get art of their pets and characters!
<br><br><b>rukaisa</b> The art community has always provided gift art, adoptables, bases, site gallery content etc... As an artist, it would feel very encouraging to not only support the community, but feel supported in return. +1
<br><br><b>lollypopx2</b>
<br><br><b>beanie_lova</b> One of those things that are better regulated above board than not. Inject some new life into this website by giving writers, artists, roleplayers, character/story/world designers a greater reason to be here. Feed off that energy for inspiration for the actual site. I do not see how this could be a lose situation for anyone involved.
<br><br><b>midnadragon</b> initially I was against the idea because I worried there would be no more art trades or they would be harder to find but I'm warming up to it if it'll bring more artists to the site.
<br><br><b>bittersweet52</b> I've seen official Neopets artists who aren't on payroll anymore (but are hired sometimes for contract work) sell Neopets-based commissions for real money. I feel like if they're allowed to do this, then the community should legally be allowed to sell fan art commissions for either real money or in-game currency. *shrug*
<br><br><b>zouzillmaya</b>you know what i agree with this. the art chat used to be so busy and engaging. i feel like this will bring back some life to not only the art chat but to neo as a whole.
<br><br><b>swiftrun</b>
<br><br><b>jokirs</b> PLEASE let art be traded for np/items. Players will be incredibly happy and thankful! The art chat will thrive! In the future it would be nice to have something similar to the trade post where artists can accept or reject trades. I would like it if the items would be held there after the request until either an image is sent or the trade is cancelled. You would need to increase the max file size a lot from what is allowed in contests though. Maybe have the image delete after a period of time after the art is sent? BUT IN THE MEANTIME just let us do it and let us know that it will be unregulated c: You already allow guild shops, how different is it really?
<br><br><b>ill337erate</b> 
This would be amazing! It is really weird to come back to Neopets and have to face how much more restricted players are here than anywhere else. And for what? Trust is already involved in so many multiplayer activities on Neopets: NC trades, notably, which indirectly involves real money, depend on both parties holding up their end of the deal. This is no different.
<br><br><b>xxhopexx</b> I was very surprised when I was told that you couldn't do it here since that was never an issue on Gaia. Good luck with this mission!
<br><br><b>purcat</b> Art commissions create major traffic to web based games like Neo! I only log into those games mentioned (Gaia, FR, DV) to commission art.
<br><br><b>wildberry090</b> I would spend....probably literally all my NP and all future NP on comms if I could 
<br><br><b>wittyhue</b> This would be such a HUGE revitalization to the art boards &amp; the creative community still on here!! I'm sure many pet owners who don't dabble in the arts would LOVE to have art of their pets, as well!! It might even incentivize more artists to come back to the site-- if they can early nps/items in a creative way. A win for everybody!!
<br><br><b>Marxiekssu</b>
<br><br><b>miaows</b> Neopets is SO behind when it comes to commissions. I've played a LOT of virtual pets sites and I don't know of a single other that doesn't allow them.
<br><br><b>shooting_star_04</b>
<br><br><b>daisyisabella28</b>I think it'll add an interesting depth to the creation side of the site
<br><br><b>ironhide_</b>
I also support the petition! Allowing commissions for art, coding, etc, would breathe some much-needed life back into the site. Neopets, despite how old it is, is stuck in its old ways - which I feel is hurting the community as a whole. It would be nice to see the creative side of the site get more active again!
<br><br><b>starfire_xo</b> loooove the idea for the petition - totally add me to it. user-generated content is the way to go
<br><br><b>kikyo_dark_angel</b>  It could be so great... not only for artist, but for people who made codes, do graphics, write, etc
<br><br><b>sirhal</b> 
Sign me up for this petition.
Commissions would really solidify my desire to stay here and encourage me to play more games and keep up with things like Food club so I can commission artists. I hope I don't get in trouble for mentioning it, but a Fan/imitation neo site allows users to do commissions and it goes just fine! it's one of the reasons why I'm there more often than here. magine popular artists opening commissions. Posting the pictures offsite. Free advertising for Neo! It may even encourage more ACTUALLY NEW players to join.
<br><br><b>st1nkz</b> Allowing for art to be sold on Neo will bring in more income and interest into the site as the art is shared across social media by many artists and their fans.
<br><br><b>jason_bourne_1</b>
<br><br><b>o00karasu00o</b> 
Also please sign me up for your petition. I always felt bad that I couldn't pay an artist when they were offering to do one of my pets. Even if it is just a small item or something I think artists should receive something for their work
<br><br><b>faeluna</b> it just makes sense tnt
<br><br><b>conjurer</b>  At the moment I don't feel comfortable asking artists for requests because it feels unfair that I can't give anything back. I'd love to be able to spend my neopoints on the amazing artists that are here! They deserve it!
<br><br><b>sychologist</b> Neopets seriously only operates out of nostalgia nowadays. The player base grows smaller and smaller. Art commissions will allow people to expand their creative outlets and bring in people out of site interested in having neopets be used for art inspiration!
<br><br><b>dragonblimp</b> Sign me up for this one!
I can't really think of another petsite that doesn't allow this, tbh. Would honestly be a lot more welcoming to keeping the fandom atually on site than having to go offsite in order to get the most out of our characters, designs, work, etc.
<br><br><b>Leksikake</b> (none, just amazing idea. supporting the hek out of this)
<br><br><b>thing00727</b> Commissions are what keep artists going, and art communities thriving. Given the increased age of the Neo userbase, it makes sense for artists to want to be fairly compensated for their work. We aren't all kids and teens anymore who have a ton of free time to draw for trades or requests. I know I don't! Commissions would definitely help motivate myself and I'm sure others to both stick around on the site longer and to draw more. I know I'd be using a good chunk of earnings to pay other artists for their work of my pets.
<br><br><b>xerethiel_synstar</b>Art commissions hurt nobody? It would also make everyones life easier to do it within the site.
<br><br><b>keese_bat</b>I'd be down for this, personally. They seem to be more lenient on things than they have been in the past, so here's hoping. (:
<br><br><b>remansi</b>This sounds like a wonderful idea! It would just require some type of new marketplace setup but would also fall right in line with the new focus they talked about in the Neopets Podcast this month. The only thing I would worry about is finding a stable market rate for np/item exchange that doesn't undervalue artist's work (like what would a 1mil comm be? Or a 100k comm?)
<br><br><b>moosuem</b>
<br><br><b>steph625steph</b>
<br><br><b>1jediboy</b> This would revitalize a love for Neopets in loyal, new AND returning players!

Art is meant to convey emotion! Someone looks deep within oneself and exerts their feelings through a creative medium, and presents it to others for to appreciate it, contemplate it, or reflect upon their own experiences from it!

Art deserves to be valued!
I strive to let as many artists I come across feel that!




<br><br><b>blueskies020</b>
<br><br><b>jagveress</b> As others have said this would be an amazing chance to breathe new life back into the art community and by extension Neopets as a whole. Could also help circulate currency within Neopets, giving people an additional place to spend their NP
Thanks for this!
<br><br><b>narwhalie</b> 100% yes. there are so many talented artists here that I would love some art from, but their time and effort deserve to be compansated. I suppose the biggest issue tnt would have with this would be the potential scamming, but i feel like neoboards and chats are so heavily moderated (filters, unable to edit or delete posts) that it would be easy to tell when it happens.
<br><br><b>egg66a</b> I'll sign! I've been wanting to make some adoptables here like back in the old days, but as I'm no longer a homeschooled teenager and there's no way to make money from it, it's very low on my priority list. I started taking drawing seriously because of neopets, and the art/roleplay community here will always have a special place in my heart. &amp; I'd love to collect art of my eyrie once he has a real design!

It would be a great way to be able to make neopoints in the post-flash world, too.
<br><br><b>aurokaa</b>
<br><br><b>maeruu</b> +1 !!! it's been asked for since forever. and i still really only see benefits from letting it happen.
re: bad eggs, all exchange communities like this always find a way to self police and the pros outweigh the cons. smaller, but relevant examples are like the pet/nc trading games that run just fine, but it's like the art threads aren't allowed to evolve since the way they were over a decade ago. realize that creativity is at the heart of what neo is. allowing np comms will bring players back.

<br><br><b>lucycat123 </b> I would love to buy and sell art on Neopets like I do on literally every other pet site I play. It would help so many players, and who could it possibly hurt?
<br><br><b>
UrsulasRevenge</b>  Long before this account, when I was younger and in school, I remember spending all of my free time learning to code and do graphic design on this site. I remember feeling so much joy sitting and creating things for others. My time on Neopets was the catalyst for my professional life, working as a graphic designer and freelancing on the side. Despite the good its done, Neopet's culture around "free art" is incredibly damaging. We should be supporting the growing artists on this site. We should teach them to know their worth, and teach others to value art. For that reason, I think allowing artists to earn commission on site, using NPs and items, is a safe way to enter into that world, as both the artist and the commissioner, especially for young Neopians.
<br><br><b>
djones04</b> Not an artist, but I know at least one other petsite which is primarily kept alive by art comms. Had there been no way to buy art with in-game cash, that site would've crumbled a while back. This site could benefit from art comms! It could (and will) bring people here, due to the hundreds of ways to earn NP on this site to commission art with.

<br><br><b> quartziferous</b>  I think this would really regulate some of the inflation in a way-- people would have a means to spend neopoints besides rare items to jazz up their lookups, shops, pages, etc. which in turn may lower the forced and artificial scarcity, even just a little! It is also a great learning tool for others to learn how to price their own art without real currency being involved, and many other browser based pet sites embrace this wholeheartedly.

<br><br><b>emiane</b> It would be a great way to distribute the wealth without heavily impacting the neopian economy through just creating additional neopets. Having creative user made stores allows for artists and web designers to gain neopoints while also creating things for those who are not artistically inclined!

<br><br><b>Kougra_Adoptables</b>  As a longtime player of Neopets, I have a passion for this website that I don't think will ever truly die. That said, I am now an adult with far less time to spend on my pets, or to engage in the events and other aspects of the site since I have bills and a life; it makes it difficult to see my time spent here as valuable, or even meaningful--Especially when the only thriving parts of the website seem to be the Pet Trading and NC Trading! It's disheartening. However, imagine letting players use their creative talents, combined with their passion for this little pet site, to meaningfully exchange artwork and other creative outlets with one another, even if using NPs or items as payment to the artists! And, if actual currency were allowed in art trades, that would help users to continue spending time on the site meaningfully, and potentially even investing back into Neopets! The Pros are worth the Cons.

<br><br><b>eclipsalvampire</b>This would be awesome! Help with the artists that spend time on their art earn something. Would definitely help with the neo-economy right now. I remember many years ago there was a site called horseland (before the revamp). Basic concept was players trained, showed and bred horses. But each horse could have a unique image. So people started doing commissions for personalized images and it was an amazing way to earn some $$ The way that it worked was based on the honour system. In order to get the image on the horse you would have to transfer it over (via a sale) to the other players barn. Then they would upload the image and sell back to the original owner. The community is just like neo. People looked out for one another. There weren't really any scammers. The horseland team was also very good. You could report if someone stole your horse and they would return it.

I still think they should be allowed, they already happen on off-site channels.
<br><br><b>starlightmishi13</b> I think it would be great if people could trade creative work for neopoints or items. I'm part of another similar community that allows that (Gaia Online_ and it's been largely positive for everyone. I'm sure people would appreciate art of their pets or custom profiles. 
<br><br><b>sophine_</b> COMMISSIONS!!!
im tired of restocking let me draw4pay. i want to draw neopets. please let me do it.

<br><br><b>rebeccanmn</b> neopets has been part of my life for 16 years as of writing, and it's what got me into arts &amp; crafts in the first place. without it, i don't think i would have became the artist i am today. i've spent most of that time honing my ability to what it is now, and i think its a disservice to the art community here on neo to not have our art be allowed compensation outside of few on-site contests such as art gallery, and only sometimes, the neopian times. countless pet sites that've followed in neo's footsteps have taken steps to acknowledge their own art communities potential, &amp; have allowed commissions for on-site currency or items. to see how neo pioneered these types of sites in general, yet be so behind when it comes to art is disheartening, &amp; i'd love for that to change. artists now more than ever could use that support &amp; there's so much potential thats been untapped that i don't think the team realizes. way of getting items/currency on-site is already quite limited as-is &amp; i think this would be a great, additional way to get things flowing. thank you!
<br><br><b>happydoodle09</b> yes, agreed on commissions. it would be perfect for np and i don't think it's any more problematic or exploitable than other parts of the site. but it shouldn't be banned completely when there are also lots of rule followers. 
<br><br><b>unnamedgraves</b> commissions pleeeeease. I do them all the time on fr and its so nice to do commissions and then be able to customize my pets on their more by doing art for game currency or items. I think its a great thing for non-artists because they could get more personal art to decorate their pages with. there could even be writing and coding commissions too!
<br><br><b>mintstyx</b>i'd love to see commissions here and start offering them myself! honestly i was kind of surprised that there wasn't a section for that already??

<br><br><b>nikpeophin</b>  I feel like artists on Neopets deserve to be compensated in some way, shape, or form honestly. We don't expect artists to do their art for free outside of Neo, so WHY should it be any different on Neo? Artists deserve competition for their time and work.
<br><br><b>Cyberpuppy33</b> Neopets should allow for this and leave it to community policing. I only really log on to other petsites and collect their currency for the exact purpose of getting art from awesome artists. I love neo more than any other pet place and I would really appreciate if I could also support the amazing artists who contribute to this community. They really are a major backbone of the place and it would give me more incentive to engage with neo.
<br><br><b>Hakusei</b> I agree with this movement. It doesn't make sense for TNT to outlaw a creative process from the community. While they don't have to advertise it or make an entire new trading method for it, TNT should allow creatives to profit on their hard work, especially if both parties (receiving and giving) agree. Having the option to do this seems just, if not necessary. Art shops would be very beneficial for the Neopets community as it promotes engagement, incentive to continue playing, create new purpose for pets, and allow those who wish to give back to the community in fairness. This change would not cause risk to the BC or AG rules any more than they already are in terms of art originality. TNT should take minimal involvement in the regulation of this and leave the option to its users to handle within themselves. Whether this is a successful trade or scam, the users should have the responsibility.
<br><br><b>blue_moon919</b> I want to commission other artists to draw my neopets!! Dressing them up is fun and all, but seeing how artists interpret the neopets that I and other players spend so much time on would would be so so cool. And they should be compensated for it!!
<br><br><b>valthan</b> In my experience with another pet site, user owned shops kept the art community alive, and it was a way for non-artists and artists to interact with each other in the forums. Some players even held activities where groups of artists would sell art to promote events. Additionally, plenty of players and their pets use commissioned art in their bios, so I believe that allowing commission here would provide players with more creative freedom when decorating their shops, pet profiles, and galleries. Most people wouldn't have the time or energy to create art for others without compensation, so allowing user owned shops (and providing a trading system that requires mutual agreement) would provide them an incentive to do so.
<br><br><b>crypticalis</b>

<br><br><b>myapot</b>
i would LOVE for there to be a commisison community! it'd add for some variety in the art forums so it's not all threads asking people to vote on their gallery entries.

but they'd also need to remove the character limits and let us post images otherwise it would be such a headache for both artist and commissioner to coordinate an order without just talking on a different platform.

<br><br><b>o_pirate_o</b> Happy to put my name in for this.
That being said - I think we should allow NP/NC items OR USD/RL currency, but not both. Because neopets has a hard line economy separate from any buyable currency, it becomes a sneaky way people can make a "legit" purchase. I think it would be easier to get approved if it was one or the other. Personally I would prefer NP and NC items because if people just want art of their characters you can sell USD art and make them not neopets anyway lol

<br><br><b>cadunciaberdov</b>

<br><br><b>_dragon_legacy</b> I support this! Other pet sites allow it fine, though because of COPPA I think it'd have to be for NP/Items in here only. Still, it's another avenue of trading for people who can't play or restock, those are always good.

<br><br><b>fluffy_bumbkin</b> Hey there! I'll happily sign the petition! I've been wanting NP commissions for years, it's about time we're allowed to do them. We're pretty much all adults anyway lol

<br><br><b>gravecircle</b>Please also add my name to your petition! I'm also a full-time freelance artist  High-fives.

There are kid-friendly games which allow for artists to be commissioned or otherwise sell their art in-game for in-game currency. I believe it can be done fairly and safely.

<br><br><b>sheepyz</b>
<br><br><b>sacrifyce</b>
<br><br><b>peofun1</b> I'll sign as well! allowing commissions seems like a good way to incentivize more artists to join Neopets as well. even if it's limited to NP/items, building a stronger artistic community can only be a good thing

<br><br><b>alliieennss</b> support. literally all other petsites allow art comms for site currency, it is simply not an issue and its surprising neopets is so behind in terms of basic petsite concepts like this.

<br><br><b>mysticdarkangel925</b>

<br><br><b>Kestriell</b> If we were to allow art commissions for neopoints, it would benefit the art community on neopets in a positive way. It would also help players who may not be able to afford commissions for real money. This way, players who don't draw, instead partake in the game to earn neopets art. In turn, artists earn neopoints by drawing neopets related content, so they are also partaking in the game in their own way. The more people engaging with neopets, the better!

<br><br><b>st1nkz </b> Absolutely support! Artists can bring their followers and potentially turn them into lifelong new/returning players in the game if items and NPs were allowed as currencies for their art.<BR><BR><BR>
