<b>May 24, 2023</b>:<br>
Hi again, pirates. After last year's nonsensical final standings, mass "shadowbans," and silence from TNT, I won't be participating in the cup this year. I'm not happy about it, but it's clear that TNT doesn't respect the time we all put into this event. Frankly, I've thought about stepping away for quite a while for various reasons, and I guess last year's disappointment was the push I needed.
<p></p>
If things get better this year, I'd be happy to hand over the reins in a more official way and facilitate things like team mails for future ACs, but for now I'm just leaving things as they are. I really don't want to encourage people to waste their time.
<p></p>
Still, I do hope that those of you who are participating this year are able to have fun. The K.I.L.L. boards and Armada guild will still be around and active during the Cup. Best of luck to all of you - I truly hope that the event is better this time around. 
<p></p>
I'm sure I'll still be online at least a bit, no matter what happens, so this isn't a goodbye or anything. Thanks for being here and always being the best team around. ❤
<p></p>

<b>June 17, 2022</b>:<br>
Amazing job so far, everyone! We're off to an incredible start, and we've got a real shot at the cup this year. We have about a week of matches left before finals, so let's finish strong! You can check the projected schedule <a href="/~Illuminating">here</a>. 
<p></p>
Be sure to mail me (neon3002) or lil_mooni if you're interested in joining our team guild or receiving some additional game tips &amp; guidance!
<p></p>
<b>May 29, 2022</b>:<br>
Sign-ups for AC XVII are now open <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/colosseum/">here</a>! It looks like this year's cup should start on June 6th, so get ready! We've also opened <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Saltbag">Pirate Lords</a> sign-ups for this year - check out that petpage for more info.
<p></p>
<b>May 15, 2022</b>:<br>
Hi everyone! Today's the last day to spend your prize points for last year's cup (don't forget the staff tournament prize shop as well!). 
<p></p>
The 17th Altador Cup is coming up soon, with sign-ups scheduled to open on May 25th. Looking forward to another chance at glory in this year's Cup *yarr*

<p></p>

<b>~ Who are we?</b>
<p></p>
Krawk Island Living Legends was founded shortly before AC II by the lovely <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=wwwdotjuliedotcom"><b>Julie</b></a> as a hub for all KI players. In the years since then, we have firmly established ourselves as a power house team, with the best average placement among all teams throughout the Cup's history, as well as taking home gold in AC IV! Our board is active in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=7">Site Events</a> section year-round.

<br><br>
During the Altador Cup, K.I.L.L. is both a score board along with a chat board to get to know your fellow KI teammates! Scores posted on the board during the cup will all be tallied by a scorekeeper and updates will be given throughout the day, with final tallies shortly after midnight once everything is calculated.
<br><br>
The K.I.L.L. petpage was formerly hosted on <a href="/~bilieus">/~Bilieus</a>, but as some pirates move on with their life - <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=tgrcheergrl"><b>Tara</b></a> took over the task from AC VI until shortly before AC VIII. The petpage is now hosted on <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=KrawkIsland">KrawkIsland</a> which was luckily grabbed in the latest purge.
<br><br>
Since Krawk Island is such a large team, we have another group - KI YYB. KI YYB focuses on (like the name implies) YYB with minimal chatting during the cup at the end of the day their scores are sent to K.I.L.L. and are added to our final total. KI YYB's petpage is hosted on <a href="/~jon_lennen"><b>/~jon_lennen</b></a>.
<br><br><b>~ Board Making!</b>
<br><br>
The first person to post "nice hat" on page 23 is deemed worthy of creating the next board! This can sometimes get competitive so please remain calm and count posts. <img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/yarr.gif"> New boards during the cup should be made promptly so they don't explode before the scorekeeper has a chance to count all scores!
<br><br>
New board procedures are as follows!
<br><center>
<b>Topic Title ★</b><br>
*star* K.I.L.L.// BOARD TITLE HERE #???? *krawkisland*
<br><br><b>First Post ★</b><br><textarea class="littleboxes">K.I.L.L. (Krawk Island Living Legends) is a board for all KI players!
Our page is on //www.neopets.com/~KrawkIsland
1. Read the petpage for board making procedures.
2. This is a chat board and a score board.
3. Be friendly to everyone. New faces are always welcome!
4. Have fun and K.I.L.L... like pirates.

Feel free to ask for an invite to our team guild (sides are welcome)!
</textarea><br><br><b>Second Post ★ (during the Cup)</b><br><textarea class="littleboxes">*rednose* Scoring Info: *rednose*
Maxes per day:
YYB: 35 games
SlSl: 65 games (min. 270 points)
MaSN: 301 games (min. 2700 points)
SOSD: 301 games

How to post scores:
YYB = Your score - their score (e.g. 11-1 = +10)

SLSL, MSN, and SOSD are your cümulative scores for each game, NOT games played</textarea></center>

Shortly after K.I.L.L. was formed, a guild was created so that the long-term members could stay in touch and have a more private place to talk. While the K.I.L.L. board is always open for conversation, membership in the guild was basically a sign that you were an active user on the boards throughout the year. Over the years, K.I.L.L.'s older members have moved on. The old guild is now a bit of a ghost town, unfortunately, but this opened up an opportunity for a newer, more active guild to be created and put to use.
<br><br>
During ACVI, we made a much bigger effort to organize the team, sending out daily strategies for each opponent. In ACVII, mailing out so many plans every day resulted in more than a few silenced accounts, so we decided to create a guild for the whole team. Starting in ACVIII, the daily plans were posted on the guild's homepage each day, allowing everyone to see our strategy privately without having to recruit a few people to send out mail every day at midnight. In addition to facilitating team organization, the guild is also another place for general chatting and getting to know your teammates, so it is active in the offseason as well.
<br><br>
The guild is called Armada, and there are no requirements for joining other than joining Krawk Island and understanding that the daily plans and other strategic discussions are to be kept within the guild.

The Pirate Lords are a group of very dedicated pirates who vow to go above and beyond every day of the Altador Cup. Pirate Lord signups are opened up before the cup begins and are open a week into the cup to help you better gauge your time and dedication.
<br><br>
Although it is difficult, Pirate Lords are expected to keep their oath throughout the cup and work on an honor system. (We can check your stats to see if you've been playing!) We understand that sometimes real life situations come up and take priority and this is completely understandable. If you feel you can no longer keep your oath feel free to drop me (neon3002) a neomail and things will be adjusted accordingly!
<br><br>
More information on Pirate Lord sign ups can be found on <a href="/~Saltbag"><b>/~Saltbag</b></a>.
<br><br><center>
<b>Pirate Lord sign ups are now open through June 13th!</b><br></center>

As Krawk Island is such a massive team and has continued to collect loyal members since ACII, a crew list has been established to help everyone get to know each other. We feel as though every K.I.L.L.er plays an important part on the team and we wouldn't feel complete without each and every one of you.
<br><br><strike>To qualify for our crew page, you must chat with us for at <b>least</b> a month. No guild membership is required. If you feel worthy, go ahead and send me (neon3002) a neomail with your name and a Neopets item (must be 80x80!) that you'd like included on the page to represent you. The item does not have to be pirate related in the slightest, feel free to pick your favorite item or an item you feel projects your personality the best.
<br><br>
Many members who were on the former list are long gone, so after ACVIII a new list has been thrown together! </strike>

<b>Our Crew page has been lost at sea. :(<br>The old list can be viewed <a href="http://neopets.com/~xSorielx"><b>here</b></a>.</b><br></center>

A few different people have decided they are willing to be super nice, and lend pets, items, and petpets out so others can get avatars. They are organized by the name of the avatar, and whether you get it from an item, pet or petpet. Within that section you will find who the owner is, any rules they have about being lent, and a list of those people wanting to be lent. <b>Please neomail the owner for more lending information</b>.
<p></p>
<b>If you wanted to be added to this list for lending</b>, please neomail me with what avatar it gives, the pet name, and what specifications the K.I.L.L.ers have to be to be lended. Try to stick to rank, account age, or things of that nature!
<p></p>
As of 05/13/15, I have cleared the lending section as some of the lenders were no longer active or possessing the item/pet in question. If you'd like to be re-added feel free to neomail <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=bolbe6">Neon</a>.
