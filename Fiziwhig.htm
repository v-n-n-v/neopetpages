<i>Opabinia regalis</i> is an extinct, stem group arthropod found in the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale Lagerstätte of British Columbia, Canada. It flourished from 505 million years ago to 487 million years ago during the Cambrian Period of the Paleozoic Era. It measured 2-3 inches in length and is presumed to have been a carnivore.<br><br><center><b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, <a href="/">link</a></center><br>

Fewer than twenty good specimens have been described; 3 specimens of <i>Opabinia</i> are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they constitute less than 0.1% of the community. <i>Opabinia</i> was a soft-bodied animal, averaging about 5.7 cm in length (excluding proboscis), and its segmented body had lobes along the sides and a fan-shaped tail. The head shows unusual features: five eyes, a mouth under the head and facing backwards, and a proboscis that probably passed food to the mouth. <i>Opabinia</i> probably lived on the seafloor, using the proboscis to seek out small, soft food.<br><br>

When the first thorough examination of <i>Opabinia</i> in 1975 revealed its unusual features, it was thought to be unrelated to any known phylum, although possibly related to a hypothetical ancestor of arthropods and of annelid worms. However other finds, most notably <i>Anomalocaris</i>, suggested that it belonged to a group of animals that were closely related to the ancestors of arthropods and of which the living animals onychophorans and tardigrades may also be members.<br><br>

In the 1970s, there was an ongoing debate about whether multi-celled animals appeared suddenly during the Early Cambrian, in an event called the Cambrian explosion, or had arisen earlier but without leaving fossils. At first <i>Opabinia</i> was regarded as strong evidence for the "explosive" hypothesis. Later the discovery of a whole series of similar lobopod animals, some with closer resemblances to arthropods, and the development of the idea of stem groups suggested that the Early Cambrian was a time of relatively fast evolution but one that could be understood without assuming any unique evolutionary processes.</div>

<div class="section">

<h1>page two</h1>

<i>Opabinia</i> looked so strange that the audience at the first presentation of Whittington's evaluation laughed. The length of <i>Opabinia</i> regalis from head to tail ranged between 4 centimetres (1.6 in) and 7 centimetres (2.8 in). The animal also had a hollow proboscis, whose total length was about one-third of the body's and projected down from under the head and then curved forwards and upwards. The proboscis was striated like a vacuum cleaner's hose and probably flexible, and it ended with a claw-like structure whose inner edges bore spines that projected inwards and forwards. The head bore five eyes: two on stalks near the front and fairly close to the middle of the head, pointing upwards and forwards; two larger eyes, also stalked, near the rear and outer edges of the head, pointing upwards and sideways; and a single eye with a shorter stalk between the larger pair of stalked eyes, pointing upwards. It has been assumed that the eyes were all compound, like arthropods' lateral eyes, but this reconstruction, which is not backed up by any evidence, is "somewhat fanciful". The mouth was under the head, behind the proboscis, and pointed backwards, so that the digestive tract formed a U-bend on its way towards the rear of the animal. The proboscis appeared sufficiently long and flexible to reach the mouth.<br><br>

The main part of the body was typically about 5 millimetres (0.20 in) wide and had 15 segments, on each of which there were pairs of lobes (flaps) pointing downwards and outwards. The lobes overlapped so that the front of each was covered by the rear edge of the one ahead of it. The body ended with what looked like a single conical segment bearing three pairs of overlapping lobes that pointed up and out, forming a tail like a V-shaped double fan.<br><br>

Interpretations of other features of <i>Opabinia</i> fossils differ. Since the animals did not have mineralized armor nor even tough organic exoskeletons like those of insects, their bodies were flattened as they were buried and fossilized, and smaller or internal features appear as markings within the outlines of the fossils.<br><br>

Whittington interpreted as gills some markings on the upper surfaces of all lobes except the first on each side, and thought that these gills were flat underneath, had overlapping layers on top, and attached to the bases of the lobes. Budd (1996, 2011) thought they consisted of separate "blades" attached along the front edges on the undersides of the lobes. He also found marks inside the lobes' front edges that he interpreted as internal channels connecting the gills to the interior of the body, much as Whittington interpreted the mark along the proboscis as an internal channel. On the other hand, Bergström (1986) interpreted both the "gills" and the lobes as part of a covering over the upper surface of the body.</div>
<a name="three"></a>
<div class="section">

<h1>page three</h1>

Whittington found evidence of near-triangular features along the body, and concluded that they were internal structures, most likely sideways extensions of the gut. Chen et al. (1994) interpreted them as contained within the lobes along the sides. Budd thought the "triangles" were too wide to fit within <i>Opabinia</i>s slender body, and that cross-section views showed they were attached separately from and lower than the lobes, and extended below the body. He later found specimens that appeared to preserve the legs' exterior cuticle. He therefore interpreted the "triangles" as short, fleshy, conical legs. He also found small mineralized patches at the tips of some, and interpreted these as claws. Zhang and Briggs (2007) evaluated the chemical composition of the "triangles", and concluded that they had the same composition as the gut, and therefore agreed with Whittington that they were part of the digestive system. Instead they regarded <i>Opabinia</i>s lobe+gill arrangement as an early form of the biramous limbs seen in trilobites and crustaceans and which may be the original form in all arthropods. However, this similar chemical composition is not only associated with the digestive tract; Budd and Daley suggest that it represents mineralization forming within fluid-filled cavities within the body (consistent with hollow lobopod legs).<br><br>

The way in which the Burgess Shale animals were buried, by a mudslide or a sediment-laden current that acted as a sandstorm, suggests they lived on the surface of the seafloor. <i>Opabinia</i> probably used its proboscis to search the sediment for food particles and pass them to its mouth. Since there is no sign of anything that might function as jaws, its food was presumably small and soft. Whittington, believing that <i>Opabinia</i> had no legs, thought that it crawled on its lobes and that it could also have swum slowly by flapping the lobes, especially if it timed the movements to create "waves". On the other hand, he thought the body was not flexible enough to allow fish-like undulations of the whole body.<br><br><i>Opabinia</i> made it clear how little was known about soft-bodied animals, which do not usually leave fossils. When Whittington described it in the mid-1970s, there was already a vigorous debate about the early evolution of animals. Preston Cloud argued in 1948 and 1968 that the process was "explosive", and in the early 1970s Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould developed their theory of punctuated equilibrium, which views evolution as long intervals of near-stasis "punctuated" by short periods of rapid change. On the other hand, around the same time Wyatt Durham and Martin Glaessner both argued that the animal kingdom had a long Proterozoic history that was hidden by the lack of fossils. Whittington (1975) concluded that <i>Opabinia</i>, and other taxa such as <i>Marrella</i> and <i>Yohoia</i>, cannot be accommodated in modern groups. This was one of the primary reasons why Gould in his book on the Burgess Shale, <i>Wonderful Life</i>, considered that Early Cambrian life was much more diverse and "experimental" than any later set of animals and that the Cambrian explosion was a truly dramatic event, possibly driven by unusual evolutionary mechanisms. He regarded <i>Opabinia</i> as so important to understanding this phenomenon that he wanted to call his book <i>Homage to Opabinia</i>.<br><br>

However, other discoveries and evaluations soon followed, revealing similar-looking animals such as <i>Anomalocaris</i> from the Burgess Shale and <i>Kerygmachela</i> from Sirius Passet. Another Burgess Shale animal, <i>Aysheaia</i>, was considered very similar to modern <i>Onychophora</i>, which are regarded as close relatives of arthropods. Paleontologists defined a group called lobopods to include animals that are thought to be close relatives of arthropods but lack jointed limbs. There is still debate about whether lobopods are monophyletic, i.e. whether they include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, and about whether arthropods are a sub-group of lobopods or a sister-group.</div>

<i>Anomalocaris</i> ("abnormal shrimp") is an extinct genus of anomalocaridid, a family of animals thought to be closely related to ancestral arthropods. The first fossils of <i>Anomalocaris</i> were discovered in the Ogygopsis Shale by Joseph Frederick Whiteaves, with more examples found by Charles Doolittle Walcott in the Burgess Shale.<br><br><center><b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, <a href="/">link</a></center><br>

Originally several fossilized parts discovered separately (the mouth, feeding appendages and tail) were thought to be three separate creatures, a misapprehension corrected by Harry B. Whittington and Derek Briggs in a 1985 journal article.<br><br><i>Anomalocaris</i> has been misidentified several times, in part due to its makeup of a mixture of mineralized and unmineralized body parts; the mouth and feeding appendage was considerably harder and more easily fossilized than the delicate body. Its name originates from a description of a detached 'arm', described by Joseph Frederick Whiteaves in 1892, as a separate crustacean-like creature due to its resemblance to the tail of a lobster or shrimp. The first fossilized anomalocaridid mouth was discovered by Charles Doolittle Walcott, who mistook it for a jellyfish and placed it in the genus <i>Peytoia</i>. Walcott also discovered a second feeding appendage, but failed to realize the similarities to Whiteaves' discovery and instead identified it as feeding appendage or tail of the extinct <i>Sidneyia</i>.</div>
<a name="two"></a>
<div class="section">

<h1>page two</h1>

The body was discovered separately and classified as a sponge in the genus  <i>Laggania</i> ; a mouth was found with the body, but was interpreted by its discoverer Simon Conway Morris as an unrelated <i>Peytoia</i> that had through happenstance settled and been preserved with  <i>Laggania</i> . Later, while clearing what he thought was an unrelated specimen, Harry B. Whittington removed a layer of covering stone to discover the unequivocally connected arm thought to be a shrimp tail and mouth thought to be a jellyfish. Whittington linked the two species, but it took several more years for researchers to realize that the continuously juxtaposed <i>Peytoia</i>,  <i>Laggania</i>  and feeding appendage actually represented a single, enormous creature. The two genera are now placed into the family Anomalocaridae. Because <i>Peytoia</i> was named first, it became the correct name for the entire animal. The original feeding arm, however, came from a larger species distinct from <i>Peytoia</i> and <i>Laggania</i>, which retains the name <i>Anomalocaris</i>.<br><br>

For the time in which it lived, <i>Anomalocaris</i> was gigantic, up to 1 metre (3.3 feet) long. It propelled itself through the water by undulating the flexible lobes on the sides of its body. Each lobe sloped below the one more posterior to it, and this overlapping allowed the lobes on each side of the body to act as a single "fin", maximizing the swimming efficiency. The construction of a remote-controlled model showed this mode of swimming to be intrinsically stable, implying that <i>Anomalocaris</i> would not have needed a complex brain to manage balance while swimming. The body was widest between the third and fifth lobe and narrowed towards the tail; it had at least 11 lobes in total. It is difficult to distinguish lobes near the tail, making an accurate count difficult.

</div>
<a name="three"></a>
<div class="section">

<h1>page three</h1>

<i>Anomalocaris</i> had an unusual disk-like mouth. The mouth was composed of 32 overlapping plates, four large and 28 small, resembling a pineapple ring with the center replaced by a series of serrated prongs. The mouth could constrict to crush prey, but never completely close, and the tooth-like prongs continued down the walls of the gullet. Two large 'arms' (up to 18 centimetres (7.1 inches) in length when extended) with barb-like spikes were in front of the mouth. The tail was large and fan-shaped, and along with undulations of the lobes, was probably used to propel the creature through Cambrian waters. Stacked lamella of what were probably gills attached to the top of each lobe.<br><br>

The eyes were 30 times as powerful as those of trilobites; <i>Anomalocaris</i> is long thought to have had the most advanced eyes of any contemporary species. With 16,000 lenses, the resolution of the 3-centimetre-wide (1.2 in) eyes would have been rivalled only by that of the modern dragonfly, which has 28,000 lenses in each eye.<br><br>

A long-standing view holds that <i>Anomalocaris</i> fed on hard-bodied animals, including trilobites—making it one of the first predators—and its mid-gut glands strongly suggest a predatory lifestyle. However, its ability to penetrate mineralised shells has been questioned. Some Cambrian trilobites have been found with round or W-shaped "bite" marks, which were identified as being the same shape as the mouthparts of <i>Anomalocaris</i>. Stronger evidence that <i>Anomalocaris</i> ate trilobites comes from coprolite, which contain trilobite parts and are so large that the anomalocarids are the only known organism from that period large enough to have produced them. However, since <i>Anomalocaris</i> lacks any mineralised tissue, it seemed unlikely that it would be able to penetrate the hard, calcified shell of trilobites. Rather, the coprolites may have been produced by a different organisms, such as the trilobites of the genus <i>Redlichia</i>.<br><br>

The lack of wear on anomalocaridid mouthparts suggests they did not come into regular contact with mineralised trilobite shells, and were possibly better suited to feeding on smaller, soft-bodied organisms by suction, since they would have experienced structural failure if they were used against the armour of trilobites. <i>A. canadensis</i> may have been capable of feeding on organisms with hard exoskeletons due to the short, robust spines on its appendages. However, as opposed to <i>Peytoia</i> whose mouthpiece is more rectangular with short protruding spines, the mouthpiece of <i>A. canadensis</i> has a smaller and more irregular diamond-shaped opening, not permitting strong biting motions, and indicating a suction-feeding behavior to suck in softer organisms.

<i>Wiwaxia</i> is a genus of <a href="/">soft-bodied animals</a> that were covered in carbonaceous scales and spines that protected it from predators. <i>Wiwaxia</i> fossils – mainly isolated scales, but sometimes complete, articulated fossils – are known from early Cambrian and middle Cambrian fossil deposits across the globe. The living animal would have measured up to 5 cm (2 inch) when fully grown, although a range of juvenile specimens are known, the smallest being 2 millimetres (0.079 in) long.<br><br>

Wiwaxia's affinity has been a matter of debate: researchers were long split between two possibilities. On the one hand, its rows of scales looked superficially similar to certain scale worms (annelids); conversely, its mouthparts and general morphology suggested a relationship to the shell-less molluscs. More recently, evidence for a molluscan affinity has been compiling, based on new details of Wiwaxia's mouthparts, scales, and growth history.<br><br>

The proposed clade Halwaxiida contains Wiwaxia as well as several similar Cambrian animals.<br><br>

Wiwaxia was bilaterally symmetrical; viewed from the top the body was elliptical with no distinct head or tail, and from the front or rear it was almost rectangular. It reached 5 centimetres (2.0 in) in length. Estimating their height is difficult because specimens were compressed after death; a typical specimen may have been 1 centimetre (0.39 in) high excluding the spines on their backs. The ratio of width to length does not appear to change as the animals grew.<br><br>

Wiwaxia's flat underside was soft and unarmored; most of the surface was occupied by a slug-like foot. Little is known of the internal anatomy, although the gut apparently ran straight and all the way from the front to the rear. At the front end of the gut, about 5 millimetres (0.20 in) from the animal's front in an average specimen about 2.5 centimetres (0.98 in) long, there was a feeding apparatus that consisted of two (or in rare large specimens three) rows of backward-pointing conical teeth. The feeding apparatus was tough enough to be frequently preserved, but unmineralized and fairly flexible.<br><br>

The animal was covered in eight rows of small ribbed armor plates called sclerites; these lay flat against the body, overlapped so that the rear of one covered the front of the one behind, and formed five main regions — the top; the upper part of the sides; the lower part of the sides; the front; and the bottom. Most of the sclerites were shaped like oval leaves, but the ventro-lateral ones, nearest the sea-floor, were crescent-shaped, rather like flattened bananas, and formed a single row. Larger specimens (greater than ~15mm) bear two rows of ribbed spines running from front to rear, one along each side of the top surface, and projecting out and slightly upwards, with a slight upwards curve near the tips. Although the spines in the middle of each row are usually the longest, up to 5 centimetres (2.0 in) long, a few specimens have rather short middle spines that represent part-grown replacements.</div></div>

<a name="002"></a>
<div class="section"><div class="pad">

<h1>page two</h1>

Each sclerite was rooted separately in the body; the roots of body sclerites are 40% of the external length or a little less, while the roots of the spines are a little over 25% of the external length; all were rooted in pockets in the skin, rather like the follicles of mammalian hair. The roots of the body sclerites were significantly narrower than the sclerites, but the spines had roots about as wide as their bases; both types of root were made of fairly soft tissue. They bore protrusive, presumably structural, ribs on their upper and (seemingly) lower surfaces.:544 The sclerites and spines were not mineralized, but made of a tough organic (carbon-based) biopolymer. Butterfield (1990) examined some sclerites under both optical and scanning electron microscopes and concluded that they were not hollow, and that the bases split and spread to form the blades, a pattern that is also seen in monocot leaves.  The sclerites bear an internal fabric of longitudinal chambers, which suggest that they were secreted from their bases in the manner of Lophotrochozoan sclerites.<br><br>

Wiwaxia's scleritome comprises eight rows of sclerites, arranged in bundles. Sclerites are periodically shed and replaced during growth, with the number of sclerites in a given bundle increasing as the animal ages to produce a thicker scleritome. Once specimens reach a certain size, spines are added to the scleritome; this size is ~15 mm in W. corrugata but substantially smaller in W. taijengensis. One juvenile specimen was originally interpreted as molting, but in fact represents a single, folded individual.<br><br>

The long dorsal spines may have been a defense against predators. Wiwaxia apparently moved by contractions of a slug-like foot on its underside. In one specimen a small brachiopod, Diraphora bellicostata, appears to be attached to one of the ventro-lateral sclerites. This suggests that adult Wiwaxia did not burrow or even plough much into the sea-floor as they moved. Two other specimens of Diraphora bellicostata have been found attached to dorsal sclerites. Wiwaxia appears to have been solitary rather than gregarious. The feeding apparatus may have acted as a rasp to strip bacteria off the top of the microbial mat that covered the sea-floor, or as a rake to gather food particles from the sea-floor.<br><br>

Wiwaxia was originally described by G.F. Matthew in 1899, from an isolated spine that had been found earlier in the Ogyopsis Shale, and classified as "Orthotheca corrugata". Further specimens were found by American paleontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott in 1911 as a result of one of his field trips to the nearby Burgess Shale (Miaolingian, 508 million years ago) in the Canadian Rocky Mountains; he classified it as a member of the polychaete group of annelid worms in its own genus Wiwaxia corrugata, citing similarities to the Aphroditidae and Polynoidae.<br><br>

In 1966 and 1967 a team led by Harry B. Whittington revisited the Burgess Shale and found so many fossils that it took years to evaluate them all. 464 complete specimens of Wiwaxia are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they comprise 0.88% of the community. Eventually in 1985 Simon Conway Morris, then a member of Whittington's team, published a detailed description and concluded that Wiwaxia was not a polychaete. All the known specimens came from in and around the Burgess Shale until 1991, when fragmentary fossils were reported from Australia's Georgina Basin. In 2004 additional finds which may represent two different species were reported from the same area.

<i>Wiwaxia</i> is a genus of <a href="/">soft-bodied animals</a> that were covered in carbonaceous scales and spines that protected it from predators. <i>Wiwaxia</i> fossils – mainly isolated scales, but sometimes complete, articulated fossils – are known from early Cambrian and middle Cambrian fossil deposits across the globe. The living animal would have measured up to 5 cm (2 inch) when fully grown, although a range of juvenile specimens are known, the smallest being 2 millimetres (0.079 in) long.<br><br>

Wiwaxia's affinity has been a matter of debate: researchers were long split between two possibilities. On the one hand, its rows of scales looked superficially similar to certain scale worms (annelids); conversely, its mouthparts and general morphology suggested a relationship to the shell-less molluscs. More recently, evidence for a molluscan affinity has been compiling, based on new details of Wiwaxia's mouthparts, scales, and growth history.<br><br>

The proposed clade Halwaxiida contains Wiwaxia as well as several similar Cambrian animals.<br><br>

Wiwaxia was bilaterally symmetrical; viewed from the top the body was elliptical with no distinct head or tail, and from the front or rear it was almost rectangular. It reached 5 centimetres (2.0 in) in length. Estimating their height is difficult because specimens were compressed after death; a typical specimen may have been 1 centimetre (0.39 in) high excluding the spines on their backs. The ratio of width to length does not appear to change as the animals grew.<br><br>

Wiwaxia's flat underside was soft and unarmored; most of the surface was occupied by a slug-like foot. Little is known of the internal anatomy, although the gut apparently ran straight and all the way from the front to the rear. At the front end of the gut, about 5 millimetres (0.20 in) from the animal's front in an average specimen about 2.5 centimetres (0.98 in) long, there was a feeding apparatus that consisted of two (or in rare large specimens three) rows of backward-pointing conical teeth. The feeding apparatus was tough enough to be frequently preserved, but unmineralized and fairly flexible.<br><br>

The animal was covered in eight rows of small ribbed armor plates called sclerites; these lay flat against the body, overlapped so that the rear of one covered the front of the one behind, and formed five main regions — the top; the upper part of the sides; the lower part of the sides; the front; and the bottom. Most of the sclerites were shaped like oval leaves, but the ventro-lateral ones, nearest the sea-floor, were crescent-shaped, rather like flattened bananas, and formed a single row. Larger specimens (greater than ~15mm) bear two rows of ribbed spines running from front to rear, one along each side of the top surface, and projecting out and slightly upwards, with a slight upwards curve near the tips. Although the spines in the middle of each row are usually the longest, up to 5 centimetres (2.0 in) long, a few specimens have rather short middle spines that represent part-grown replacements.</div></div>

<a name="002"></a>
<div class="section"><div class="pad">

<h1>page two</h1>

Each sclerite was rooted separately in the body; the roots of body sclerites are 40% of the external length or a little less, while the roots of the spines are a little over 25% of the external length; all were rooted in pockets in the skin, rather like the follicles of mammalian hair. The roots of the body sclerites were significantly narrower than the sclerites, but the spines had roots about as wide as their bases; both types of root were made of fairly soft tissue. They bore protrusive, presumably structural, ribs on their upper and (seemingly) lower surfaces.:544 The sclerites and spines were not mineralized, but made of a tough organic (carbon-based) biopolymer. Butterfield (1990) examined some sclerites under both optical and scanning electron microscopes and concluded that they were not hollow, and that the bases split and spread to form the blades, a pattern that is also seen in monocot leaves.  The sclerites bear an internal fabric of longitudinal chambers, which suggest that they were secreted from their bases in the manner of Lophotrochozoan sclerites.<br><br>

Wiwaxia's scleritome comprises eight rows of sclerites, arranged in bundles. Sclerites are periodically shed and replaced during growth, with the number of sclerites in a given bundle increasing as the animal ages to produce a thicker scleritome. Once specimens reach a certain size, spines are added to the scleritome; this size is ~15 mm in W. corrugata but substantially smaller in W. taijengensis. One juvenile specimen was originally interpreted as molting, but in fact represents a single, folded individual.<br><br>

The long dorsal spines may have been a defense against predators. Wiwaxia apparently moved by contractions of a slug-like foot on its underside. In one specimen a small brachiopod, Diraphora bellicostata, appears to be attached to one of the ventro-lateral sclerites. This suggests that adult Wiwaxia did not burrow or even plough much into the sea-floor as they moved. Two other specimens of Diraphora bellicostata have been found attached to dorsal sclerites. Wiwaxia appears to have been solitary rather than gregarious. The feeding apparatus may have acted as a rasp to strip bacteria off the top of the microbial mat that covered the sea-floor, or as a rake to gather food particles from the sea-floor.<br><br>

<i>Pikaia</i> was a primitive chordate that lacked a well-defined head and averaged about 1 1/2 inches (3.8 cm) in length. It had a pair of large, antenna-like tentacles on its head, and a series of short appendages, which may be linked to gill slits, on either side of its head. In these ways, it differs from the living lancelet. The "tentacles" on its head may be comparable to those in the present-day hagfish, a jawless chordate.<br><br><center><b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <a href="/">link</a></center><br>

Although primitive, <i>Pikaia</i> shows the essential prerequisites for vertebrates. When alive, <i>Pikaia</i> was a compressed, leaf-shaped animal with an expanded tail fin; the flattened body is divided into pairs of segmented muscle blocks, seen as faint vertical lines. The muscles lie on either side of a flexible structure resembling a rod that runs from the tip of the head to the tip of the tail. It likely swam by throwing its body into a series of S-shaped, zigzag curves, similar to the movement of eels; fish inherited the same swimming movement, but they generally have stiffer backbones. These adaptations may have allowed <i>Pikaia</i> to filter particles from the water as it swam along. <i>Pikaia</i> was probably a slow swimmer, since it lacked the fast-twitch fibers that are associated with rapid swimming in modern chordates.<br><br>

Conway Morris and Caron (2012) published an exhaustive description based on all 114 of the known fossil specimens; they discovered new and unexpected characteristics that they recognized as primitive features of the first chordate animals. On the basis of these findings, they constructed a new scenario for chordate evolution. Subsequently, Mallatt and Holland reconsidered Conway Morris and Caron's description, and concluded that many of the newly recognized characters are unique, already-divergent specializations that would not be helpful for establishing <i>Pikaia</i> as a basal chordate.</div></div>

<i>P. gracilens</i> was discovered by Charles Walcott and first described by him in 1911. It was named after Pika Peak, a mountain in Alberta, Canada. Based on the obvious and regular segmentation of the body, Walcott classified it as a polychaete worm.<br><br>

During his re-examination of the Burgess Shale fauna in 1979, paleontologist Simon Conway Morris placed <i>P. gracilens</i> among the chordates, making it perhaps the oldest known ancestor of modern vertebrates. He did this because it seemed to have a very primitive, proto-notochord, however, the status of <i>Pikaia</i> as a chordate is not universally accepted; its preservational mode suggests that it had cuticle, which is uncharacteristic of the vertebrates (although characteristic of other cephalochordates); further, its tentacles are unknown from other vertebrate lineages. The presence of earlier chordates among the Chengjiang, including <i>Haikouichthys</i> and <i>Myllokunmingia</i>, appears to show that cuticle is not necessary for preservation, overruling the taphonomic argument, but the presence of tentacles remains intriguing, and the organism cannot be assigned conclusively, even to the vertebrate stem group. Its anatomy closely resembles the modern creature <i>Branchiostoma</i>.<br><br>

Much debate on whether <i>Pikaia</i> is a vertebrate ancestor, its worm-like appearance notwithstanding, exists in scientific circles. It looks like a worm that has been flattened sideways. The fossils compressed within the Burgess Shale show chordate features such as traces of an elongate notochord, dorsal nerve cord, and blocks of muscles (myotomes) down either side of the body – all critical features for the evolution of the vertebrates.</div></div>

The notochord, a flexible rod-like structure that runs along the back of the animal, lengthens and stiffens the body so that it can be flexed from side to side by the muscle blocks for swimming. In the fish and all subsequent vertebrates, the notochord forms the backbone (or vertebral column). The backbone strengthens the body, supports strut-like limbs, and protects the vital dorsal nerve cord, while at the same time allowing the body to bend.<br><br>

A <i>Pikaia</i> lookalike, the lancelet <i>Branchiostoma</i>, still exists today. With a notochord and paired muscle blocks, the lancelet and <i>Pikaia</i> belong to the chordate group of animals from which the vertebrates descended. Molecular studies have refuted earlier hypotheses that lancelets might be the closest living relative to the vertebrates, instead favoring tunicates in this position; other living and fossil groups, such as acorn worms and graptolites, are more primitive.<br><br>

The presence of a creature as complex as <i>Pikaia</i> some 530 million years ago reinforces the controversial view that the diversification of life must have extended back well before Cambrian times – perhaps deep into the Precambrian.<br><br>

The first sign of head development, cephalization, is seen in chordates such as <i>Pikaia</i> and <i>Branchiostoma</i>. It is thought that development of a head structure resulted from a long body shape, a swimming habit, and a mouth at the end that came into contact with the environment first, as the animal swam forward. The search for food required ways of continually testing what lay ahead so it is thought that anatomical structures for seeing, feeling, and smelling developed around the mouth. The information these structures gathered was processed by a swelling of the nerve cord (efflorescence) – the precursor of the brain. Altogether, these front-end structures formed the distinct part of the vertebrate body known as the head.</div></div>

<i>Wiwaxia</i> is a genus of <a href="/">soft-bodied animals</a> that were covered in carbonaceous scales and spines that protected it from predators. <i>Wiwaxia</i> fossils – mainly isolated scales, but sometimes complete, articulated fossils – are known from early Cambrian and middle Cambrian fossil deposits across the globe. The living animal would have measured up to 5 cm (2 inch) when fully grown, although a range of juvenile specimens are known, the smallest being 2 millimetres (0.079 in) long.<br><br>

Wiwaxia's affinity has been a matter of debate: researchers were long split between two possibilities. On the one hand, its rows of scales looked superficially similar to certain scale worms (annelids); conversely, its mouthparts and general morphology suggested a relationship to the shell-less molluscs. More recently, evidence for a molluscan affinity has been compiling, based on new details of Wiwaxia's mouthparts, scales, and growth history.<br><br>

The proposed clade Halwaxiida contains Wiwaxia as well as several similar Cambrian animals.</div>

Wiwaxia was bilaterally symmetrical; viewed from the top the body was elliptical with no distinct head or tail, and from the front or rear it was almost rectangular. It reached 5 centimetres (2.0 in) in length. Estimating their height is difficult because specimens were compressed after death; a typical specimen may have been 1 centimetre (0.39 in) high excluding the spines on their backs. The ratio of width to length does not appear to change as the animals grew.<br><br>

Wiwaxia's flat underside was soft and unarmored; most of the surface was occupied by a slug-like foot. Little is known of the internal anatomy, although the gut apparently ran straight and all the way from the front to the rear. At the front end of the gut, about 5 millimetres (0.20 in) from the animal's front in an average specimen about 2.5 centimetres (0.98 in) long, there was a feeding apparatus that consisted of two (or in rare large specimens three) rows of backward-pointing conical teeth. The feeding apparatus was tough enough to be frequently preserved, but unmineralized and fairly flexible.

<i>Pikaia</i> was a primitive chordate that lacked a well-defined head and averaged about 1 1/2 inches (3.8 cm) in length. It had a pair of large, antenna-like tentacles on its head, and a series of short appendages, which may be linked to gill slits, on either side of its head. In these ways, it differs from the living lancelet. The "tentacles" on its head may be comparable to those in the present-day hagfish, a jawless chordate.<br><br><center><b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <a href="/">link</a></center><br>

Although primitive, <i>Pikaia</i> shows the essential prerequisites for vertebrates. When alive, <i>Pikaia</i> was a compressed, leaf-shaped animal with an expanded tail fin; the flattened body is divided into pairs of segmented muscle blocks, seen as faint vertical lines. The muscles lie on either side of a flexible structure resembling a rod that runs from the tip of the head to the tip of the tail. It likely swam by throwing its body into a series of S-shaped, zigzag curves, similar to the movement of eels; fish inherited the same swimming movement, but they generally have stiffer backbones. These adaptations may have allowed <i>Pikaia</i> to filter particles from the water as it swam along. <i>Pikaia</i> was probably a slow swimmer, since it lacked the fast-twitch fibers that are associated with rapid swimming in modern chordates.<br><br>

Conway Morris and Caron (2012) published an exhaustive description based on all 114 of the known fossil specimens; they discovered new and unexpected characteristics that they recognized as primitive features of the first chordate animals. On the basis of these findings, they constructed a new scenario for chordate evolution. Subsequently, Mallatt and Holland reconsidered Conway Morris and Caron's description, and concluded that many of the newly recognized characters are unique, already-divergent specializations that would not be helpful for establishing <i>Pikaia</i> as a basal chordate.

<i>Pikaia</i> was a primitive chordate that lacked a well-defined head and averaged about 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) in length. It had a pair of large, antenna-like tentacles on its head, and a series of short appendages, which may be linked to gill slits, on either side of its head. In these ways, it differs from the living lancelet. The "tentacles" on its head may be comparable to those in the present-day hagfish, a jawless chordate.<br><br><center><b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <a href="/">link</a></center><br>

Although primitive, <i>Pikaia</i> shows the essential prerequisites for vertebrates. When alive, <i>Pikaia</i> was a compressed, leaf-shaped animal with an expanded tail fin; the flattened body is divided into pairs of segmented muscle blocks, seen as faint vertical lines. The muscles lie on either side of a flexible structure resembling a rod that runs from the tip of the head to the tip of the tail. It likely swam by throwing its body into a series of S-shaped, zigzag curves, similar to the movement of eels; fish inherited the same swimming movement, but they generally have stiffer backbones. These adaptations may have allowed <i>Pikaia</i> to filter particles from the water as it swam along. <i>Pikaia</i> was probably a slow swimmer, since it lacked the fast-twitch fibers that are associated with rapid swimming in modern chordates.<br><br><h2>subheader</h2>

Conway Morris and Caron (2012) published an exhaustive description based on all 114 of the known fossil specimens; they discovered new and unexpected characteristics that they recognized as primitive features of the first chordate animals. On the basis of these findings, they constructed a new scenario for chordate evolution. Subsequently, Mallatt and Holland reconsidered Conway Morris and Caron's description, and concluded that many of the newly recognized characters are unique, already-divergent specializations that would not be helpful for establishing <i>Pikaia</i> as a basal chordate.<br><br><i>P. gracilens</i> was discovered by Charles Walcott and first described by him in 1911. It was named after Pika Peak, a mountain in Alberta, Canada. Based on the obvious and regular segmentation of the body, Walcott classified it as a polychaete worm.<br><br>

During his re-examination of the Burgess Shale fauna in 1979, paleontologist Simon Conway Morris placed <i>P. gracilens</i> among the chordates, making it perhaps the oldest known ancestor of modern vertebrates. He did this because it seemed to have a very primitive, proto-notochord, however, the status of <i>Pikaia</i> as a chordate is not universally accepted; its preservational mode suggests that it had cuticle, which is uncharacteristic of the vertebrates (although characteristic of other cephalochordates); further, its tentacles are unknown from other vertebrate lineages. The presence of earlier chordates among the Chengjiang, including <i>Haikouichthys</i> and <i>Myllokunmingia</i>, appears to show that cuticle is not necessary for preservation, overruling the taphonomic argument, but the presence of tentacles remains intriguing, and the organism cannot be assigned conclusively, even to the vertebrate stem group. Its anatomy closely resembles the modern creature <i>Branchiostoma</i>.<br><br>

Much debate on whether <i>Pikaia</i> is a vertebrate ancestor, its worm-like appearance notwithstanding, exists in scientific circles. It looks like a worm that has been flattened sideways. The fossils compressed within the Burgess Shale show chordate features such as traces of an elongate notochord, dorsal nerve cord, and blocks of muscles (myotomes) down either side of the body – all critical features for the evolution of the vertebrates.<br><br>

The notochord, a flexible rod-like structure that runs along the back of the animal, lengthens and stiffens the body so that it can be flexed from side to side by the muscle blocks for swimming. In the fish and all subsequent vertebrates, the notochord forms the backbone (or vertebral column). The backbone strengthens the body, supports strut-like limbs, and protects the vital dorsal nerve cord, while at the same time allowing the body to bend.<br><br>

A <i>Pikaia</i> lookalike, the lancelet <i>Branchiostoma</i>, still exists today. With a notochord and paired muscle blocks, the lancelet and <i>Pikaia</i> belong to the chordate group of animals from which the vertebrates descended. Molecular studies have refuted earlier hypotheses that lancelets might be the closest living relative to the vertebrates, instead favoring tunicates in this position; other living and fossil groups, such as acorn worms and graptolites, are more primitive.<br><br>

The presence of a creature as complex as <i>Pikaia</i> some 530 million years ago reinforces the controversial view that the diversification of life must have extended back well before Cambrian times – perhaps deep into the Precambrian.<br><br>

The first sign of head development, cephalization, is seen in chordates such as <i>Pikaia</i> and <i>Branchiostoma</i>. It is thought that development of a head structure resulted from a long body shape, a swimming habit, and a mouth at the end that came into contact with the environment first, as the animal swam forward. The search for food required ways of continually testing what lay ahead so it is thought that anatomical structures for seeing, feeling, and smelling developed around the mouth. The information these structures gathered was processed by a swelling of the nerve cord (efflorescence) – the precursor of the brain. Altogether, these front-end structures formed the distinct part of the vertebrate body known as the head.</div>

<i>Wiwaxia</i> is a genus of soft-bodied animals that were covered in carbonaceous scales and spines that protected it from predators.<br><br><center><b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, <strong>strong</strong>, <a href="/">link</a></center><br><i>Wiwaxia</i> fossils – mainly isolated scales, but sometimes complete, articulated fossils – are known from early Cambrian and middle Cambrian fossil deposits across the globe. The living animal would have measured up to 5 cm (2 inch) when fully grown, although a range of juvenile specimens are known, the smallest being 2 millimetres (0.079 in) long.<br><br>

Wiwaxia's affinity has been a matter of debate: researchers were long split between two possibilities. On the one hand, its rows of scales looked superficially similar to certain scale worms (annelids); conversely, its mouthparts and general morphology suggested a relationship to the shell-less molluscs. More recently, evidence for a molluscan affinity has been compiling, based on new details of Wiwaxia's mouthparts, scales, and growth history.<br><br>

The proposed clade Halwaxiida contains Wiwaxia as well as several similar Cambrian animals.</div></div>

<a name="two"></a>
<div class="section"><div class="pad">

<h1>page two</h1>

Wiwaxia was bilaterally symmetrical; viewed from the top the body was elliptical with no distinct head or tail, and from the front or rear it was almost rectangular. It reached 5 centimetres (2.0 in) in length. Estimating their height is difficult because specimens were compressed after death; a typical specimen may have been 1 centimetre (0.39 in) high excluding the spines on their backs. The ratio of width to length does not appear to change as the animals grew.<br><br>

Wiwaxia's flat underside was soft and unarmored; most of the surface was occupied by a slug-like foot. Little is known of the internal anatomy, although the gut apparently ran straight and all the way from the front to the rear. At the front end of the gut, about 5 millimetres (0.20 in) from the animal's front in an average specimen about 2.5 centimetres (0.98 in) long, there was a feeding apparatus that consisted of two (or in rare large specimens three) rows of backward-pointing conical teeth. The feeding apparatus was tough enough to be frequently preserved, but unmineralized and fairly flexible.<br><br>

The animal was covered in eight rows of small ribbed armor plates called sclerites; these lay flat against the body, overlapped so that the rear of one covered the front of the one behind, and formed five main regions — the top; the upper part of the sides; the lower part of the sides; the front; and the bottom. Most of the sclerites were shaped like oval leaves, but the ventro-lateral ones, nearest the sea-floor, were crescent-shaped, rather like flattened bananas, and formed a single row. Larger specimens (greater than ~15mm) bear two rows of ribbed spines running from front to rear, one along each side of the top surface, and projecting out and slightly upwards, with a slight upwards curve near the tips. Although the spines in the middle of each row are usually the longest, up to 5 centimetres (2.0 in) long, a few specimens have rather short middle spines that represent part-grown replacements.<br><br>

Each sclerite was rooted separately in the body; the roots of body sclerites are 40% of the external length or a little less, while the roots of the spines are a little over 25% of the external length; all were rooted in pockets in the skin, rather like the follicles of mammalian hair. The roots of the body sclerites were significantly narrower than the sclerites, but the spines had roots about as wide as their bases; both types of root were made of fairly soft tissue. They bore protrusive, presumably structural, ribs on their upper and (seemingly) lower surfaces.:544 The sclerites and spines were not mineralized, but made of a tough organic (carbon-based) biopolymer. Butterfield (1990) examined some sclerites under both optical and scanning electron microscopes and concluded that they were not hollow, and that the bases split and spread to form the blades, a pattern that is also seen in monocot leaves.  The sclerites bear an internal fabric of longitudinal chambers, which suggest that they were secreted from their bases in the manner of Lophotrochozoan sclerites.<br><br>

Wiwaxia's scleritome comprises eight rows of sclerites, arranged in bundles. Sclerites are periodically shed and replaced during growth, with the number of sclerites in a given bundle increasing as the animal ages to produce a thicker scleritome. Once specimens reach a certain size, spines are added to the scleritome; this size is ~15 mm in W. corrugata but substantially smaller in W. taijengensis. One juvenile specimen was originally interpreted as molting, but in fact represents a single, folded individual.<br><br>

The long dorsal spines may have been a defense against predators. Wiwaxia apparently moved by contractions of a slug-like foot on its underside. In one specimen a small brachiopod, Diraphora bellicostata, appears to be attached to one of the ventro-lateral sclerites. This suggests that adult Wiwaxia did not burrow or even plough much into the sea-floor as they moved. Two other specimens of Diraphora bellicostata have been found attached to dorsal sclerites. Wiwaxia appears to have been solitary rather than gregarious. The feeding apparatus may have acted as a rasp to strip bacteria off the top of the microbial mat that covered the sea-floor, or as a rake to gather food particles from the sea-floor.<br><br>

Wiwaxia was originally described by G.F. Matthew in 1899, from an isolated spine that had been found earlier in the Ogyopsis Shale, and classified as "Orthotheca corrugata". Further specimens were found by American paleontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott in 1911 as a result of one of his field trips to the nearby Burgess Shale (Miaolingian, 508 million years ago) in the Canadian Rocky Mountains; he classified it as a member of the polychaete group of annelid worms in its own genus Wiwaxia corrugata, citing similarities to the Aphroditidae and Polynoidae.<br><br>

In 1966 and 1967 a team led by Harry B. Whittington revisited the Burgess Shale and found so many fossils that it took years to evaluate them all. 464 complete specimens of Wiwaxia are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they comprise 0.88% of the community. Eventually in 1985 Simon Conway Morris, then a member of Whittington's team, published a detailed description and concluded that Wiwaxia was not a polychaete. All the known specimens came from in and around the Burgess Shale until 1991, when fragmentary fossils were reported from Australia's Georgina Basin. In 2004 additional finds which may represent two different species were reported from the same area.</div></div>

<i>Opabinia regalis</i> is an extinct, stem group arthropod found in the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale Lagerstätte of British Columbia, Canada. It flourished from 505 million years ago to 487 million years ago during the Cambrian Period of the Paleozoic Era. It measured 2-3 inches in length and is presumed to have been a carnivore. Fewer than twenty good specimens have been described; 3 specimens of <i>Opabinia</i> are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they constitute less than 0.1% of the community. <i>Opabinia</i> was a soft-bodied animal, averaging about 5.7 cm in length (excluding proboscis), and its segmented body had lobes along the sides and a fan-shaped tail. The head shows unusual features: five eyes, a mouth under the head and facing backwards, and a proboscis that probably passed food to the mouth. <i>Opabinia</i> probably lived on the seafloor, using the proboscis to seek out small, soft food.<br><br><center><b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, <a href="/">link</a></center><br>

When the first thorough examination of <i>Opabinia</i> in 1975 revealed its unusual features, it was thought to be unrelated to any known phylum, although possibly related to a hypothetical ancestor of arthropods and of annelid worms. However other finds, most notably <i>Anomalocaris</i>, suggested that it belonged to a group of animals that were closely related to the ancestors of arthropods and of which the living animals onychophorans and tardigrades may also be members.<br><br>

In the 1970s, there was an ongoing debate about whether multi-celled animals appeared suddenly during the Early Cambrian, in an event called the Cambrian explosion, or had arisen earlier but without leaving fossils. At first <i>Opabinia</i> was regarded as strong evidence for the "explosive" hypothesis. Later the discovery of a whole series of similar lobopod animals, some with closer resemblances to arthropods, and the development of the idea of stem groups suggested that the Early Cambrian was a time of relatively fast evolution but one that could be understood without assuming any unique evolutionary processes.<br><br><i>Opabinia</i> looked so strange that the audience at the first presentation of Whittington's evaluation laughed. The length of <i>Opabinia</i> regalis from head to tail ranged between 4 centimetres (1.6 in) and 7 centimetres (2.8 in). The animal also had a hollow proboscis, whose total length was about one-third of the body's and projected down from under the head and then curved forwards and upwards. The proboscis was striated like a vacuum cleaner's hose and probably flexible, and it ended with a claw-like structure whose inner edges bore spines that projected inwards and forwards. The head bore five eyes: two on stalks near the front and fairly close to the middle of the head, pointing upwards and forwards; two larger eyes, also stalked, near the rear and outer edges of the head, pointing upwards and sideways; and a single eye with a shorter stalk between the larger pair of stalked eyes, pointing upwards. It has been assumed that the eyes were all compound, like arthropods' lateral eyes, but this reconstruction, which is not backed up by any evidence, is "somewhat fanciful". The mouth was under the head, behind the proboscis, and pointed backwards, so that the digestive tract formed a U-bend on its way towards the rear of the animal. The proboscis appeared sufficiently long and flexible to reach the mouth.<br><br>

The main part of the body was typically about 5 millimetres (0.20 in) wide and had 15 segments, on each of which there were pairs of lobes (flaps) pointing downwards and outwards. The lobes overlapped so that the front of each was covered by the rear edge of the one ahead of it. The body ended with what looked like a single conical segment bearing three pairs of overlapping lobes that pointed up and out, forming a tail like a V-shaped double fan.</div>

Interpretations of other features of <i>Opabinia</i> fossils differ. Since the animals did not have mineralized armor nor even tough organic exoskeletons like those of insects, their bodies were flattened as they were buried and fossilized, and smaller or internal features appear as markings within the outlines of the fossils.<br><br>

Whittington interpreted as gills some markings on the upper surfaces of all lobes except the first on each side, and thought that these gills were flat underneath, had overlapping layers on top, and attached to the bases of the lobes. Budd (1996, 2011) thought they consisted of separate "blades" attached along the front edges on the undersides of the lobes. He also found marks inside the lobes' front edges that he interpreted as internal channels connecting the gills to the interior of the body, much as Whittington interpreted the mark along the proboscis as an internal channel. On the other hand, Bergström (1986) interpreted both the "gills" and the lobes as part of a covering over the upper surface of the body.<br><br>

Whittington found evidence of near-triangular features along the body, and concluded that they were internal structures, most likely sideways extensions of the gut. Chen et al. (1994) interpreted them as contained within the lobes along the sides. Budd thought the "triangles" were too wide to fit within <i>Opabinia</i>s slender body, and that cross-section views showed they were attached separately from and lower than the lobes, and extended below the body. He later found specimens that appeared to preserve the legs' exterior cuticle. He therefore interpreted the "triangles" as short, fleshy, conical legs. He also found small mineralized patches at the tips of some, and interpreted these as claws. Zhang and Briggs (2007) evaluated the chemical composition of the "triangles", and concluded that they had the same composition as the gut, and therefore agreed with Whittington that they were part of the digestive system. Instead they regarded <i>Opabinia</i>s lobe+gill arrangement as an early form of the biramous limbs seen in trilobites and crustaceans and which may be the original form in all arthropods. However, this similar chemical composition is not only associated with the digestive tract; Budd and Daley suggest that it represents mineralization forming within fluid-filled cavities within the body (consistent with hollow lobopod legs).<br><br>

The way in which the Burgess Shale animals were buried, by a mudslide or a sediment-laden current that acted as a sandstorm, suggests they lived on the surface of the seafloor. <i>Opabinia</i> probably used its proboscis to search the sediment for food particles and pass them to its mouth. Since there is no sign of anything that might function as jaws, its food was presumably small and soft. Whittington, believing that <i>Opabinia</i> had no legs, thought that it crawled on its lobes and that it could also have swum slowly by flapping the lobes, especially if it timed the movements to create "waves". On the other hand, he thought the body was not flexible enough to allow fish-like undulations of the whole body.</div>

<i>Opabinia</i> made it clear how little was known about soft-bodied animals, which do not usually leave fossils. When Whittington described it in the mid-1970s, there was already a vigorous debate about the early evolution of animals. Preston Cloud argued in 1948 and 1968 that the process was "explosive", and in the early 1970s Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould developed their theory of punctuated equilibrium, which views evolution as long intervals of near-stasis "punctuated" by short periods of rapid change. On the other hand, around the same time Wyatt Durham and Martin Glaessner both argued that the animal kingdom had a long Proterozoic history that was hidden by the lack of fossils. Whittington (1975) concluded that <i>Opabinia</i>, and other taxa such as <i>Marrella</i> and <i>Yohoia</i>, cannot be accommodated in modern groups. This was one of the primary reasons why Gould in his book on the Burgess Shale, <i>Wonderful Life</i>, considered that Early Cambrian life was much more diverse and "experimental" than any later set of animals and that the Cambrian explosion was a truly dramatic event, possibly driven by unusual evolutionary mechanisms. He regarded <i>Opabinia</i> as so important to understanding this phenomenon that he wanted to call his book <i>Homage to Opabinia</i>.<br><br>

However, other discoveries and evaluations soon followed, revealing similar-looking animals such as <i>Anomalocaris</i> from the Burgess Shale and <i>Kerygmachela</i> from Sirius Passet. Another Burgess Shale animal, <i>Aysheaia</i>, was considered very similar to modern <i>Onychophora</i>, which are regarded as close relatives of arthropods. Paleontologists defined a group called lobopods to include animals that are thought to be close relatives of arthropods but lack jointed limbs. There is still debate about whether lobopods are monophyletic, i.e. whether they include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, and about whether arthropods are a sub-group of lobopods or a sister-group.</div>

<i>Opabinia regalis</i> is an extinct, stem group arthropod found in the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale Lagerstätte of British Columbia, Canada. It flourished from 505 million years ago to 487 million years ago during the Cambrian Period of the Paleozoic Era. It measured 2-3 inches in length and is presumed to have been a carnivore. Fewer than twenty good specimens have been described; 3 specimens of <i>Opabinia</i> are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they constitute less than 0.1% of the community. <i>Opabinia</i> was a soft-bodied animal, averaging about 5.7 cm in length (excluding proboscis), and its segmented body had lobes along the sides and a fan-shaped tail. The head shows unusual features: five eyes, a mouth under the head and facing backwards, and a proboscis that probably passed food to the mouth. <i>Opabinia</i> probably lived on the seafloor, using the proboscis to seek out small, soft food.<br><br><center><b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, <a href="/">link</a></center><br>

When the first thorough examination of <i>Opabinia</i> in 1975 revealed its unusual features, it was thought to be unrelated to any known phylum, although possibly related to a hypothetical ancestor of arthropods and of annelid worms. However other finds, most notably <i>Anomalocaris</i>, suggested that it belonged to a group of animals that were closely related to the ancestors of arthropods and of which the living animals onychophorans and tardigrades may also be members.<br><br>

In the 1970s, there was an ongoing debate about whether multi-celled animals appeared suddenly during the Early Cambrian, in an event called the Cambrian explosion, or had arisen earlier but without leaving fossils. At first <i>Opabinia</i> was regarded as strong evidence for the "explosive" hypothesis. Later the discovery of a whole series of similar lobopod animals, some with closer resemblances to arthropods, and the development of the idea of stem groups suggested that the Early Cambrian was a time of relatively fast evolution but one that could be understood without assuming any unique evolutionary processes.<br><br><i>Opabinia</i> looked so strange that the audience at the first presentation of Whittington's evaluation laughed. The length of <i>Opabinia</i> regalis from head to tail ranged between 4 centimetres (1.6 in) and 7 centimetres (2.8 in). The animal also had a hollow proboscis, whose total length was about one-third of the body's and projected down from under the head and then curved forwards and upwards. The proboscis was striated like a vacuum cleaner's hose and probably flexible, and it ended with a claw-like structure whose inner edges bore spines that projected inwards and forwards. The head bore five eyes: two on stalks near the front and fairly close to the middle of the head, pointing upwards and forwards; two larger eyes, also stalked, near the rear and outer edges of the head, pointing upwards and sideways; and a single eye with a shorter stalk between the larger pair of stalked eyes, pointing upwards. It has been assumed that the eyes were all compound, like arthropods' lateral eyes, but this reconstruction, which is not backed up by any evidence, is "somewhat fanciful". The mouth was under the head, behind the proboscis, and pointed backwards, so that the digestive tract formed a U-bend on its way towards the rear of the animal. The proboscis appeared sufficiently long and flexible to reach the mouth.<br><br>

The main part of the body was typically about 5 millimetres (0.20 in) wide and had 15 segments, on each of which there were pairs of lobes (flaps) pointing downwards and outwards. The lobes overlapped so that the front of each was covered by the rear edge of the one ahead of it. The body ended with what looked like a single conical segment bearing three pairs of overlapping lobes that pointed up and out, forming a tail like a V-shaped double fan.

Interpretations of other features of <i>Opabinia</i> fossils differ. Since the animals did not have mineralized armor nor even tough organic exoskeletons like those of insects, their bodies were flattened as they were buried and fossilized, and smaller or internal features appear as markings within the outlines of the fossils.<br><br>

Whittington interpreted as gills some markings on the upper surfaces of all lobes except the first on each side, and thought that these gills were flat underneath, had overlapping layers on top, and attached to the bases of the lobes. Budd (1996, 2011) thought they consisted of separate "blades" attached along the front edges on the undersides of the lobes. He also found marks inside the lobes' front edges that he interpreted as internal channels connecting the gills to the interior of the body, much as Whittington interpreted the mark along the proboscis as an internal channel. On the other hand, Bergström (1986) interpreted both the "gills" and the lobes as part of a covering over the upper surface of the body.<br><br>

Whittington found evidence of near-triangular features along the body, and concluded that they were internal structures, most likely sideways extensions of the gut. Chen et al. (1994) interpreted them as contained within the lobes along the sides. Budd thought the "triangles" were too wide to fit within <i>Opabinia</i>s slender body, and that cross-section views showed they were attached separately from and lower than the lobes, and extended below the body. He later found specimens that appeared to preserve the legs' exterior cuticle. He therefore interpreted the "triangles" as short, fleshy, conical legs. He also found small mineralized patches at the tips of some, and interpreted these as claws. Zhang and Briggs (2007) evaluated the chemical composition of the "triangles", and concluded that they had the same composition as the gut, and therefore agreed with Whittington that they were part of the digestive system. Instead they regarded <i>Opabinia</i>s lobe+gill arrangement as an early form of the biramous limbs seen in trilobites and crustaceans and which may be the original form in all arthropods. However, this similar chemical composition is not only associated with the digestive tract; Budd and Daley suggest that it represents mineralization forming within fluid-filled cavities within the body (consistent with hollow lobopod legs).<br><br>

The way in which the Burgess Shale animals were buried, by a mudslide or a sediment-laden current that acted as a sandstorm, suggests they lived on the surface of the seafloor. <i>Opabinia</i> probably used its proboscis to search the sediment for food particles and pass them to its mouth. Since there is no sign of anything that might function as jaws, its food was presumably small and soft. Whittington, believing that <i>Opabinia</i> had no legs, thought that it crawled on its lobes and that it could also have swum slowly by flapping the lobes, especially if it timed the movements to create "waves". On the other hand, he thought the body was not flexible enough to allow fish-like undulations of the whole body.</div></div>

<i>Opabinia</i> made it clear how little was known about soft-bodied animals, which do not usually leave fossils. When Whittington described it in the mid-1970s, there was already a vigorous debate about the early evolution of animals. Preston Cloud argued in 1948 and 1968 that the process was "explosive", and in the early 1970s Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould developed their theory of punctuated equilibrium, which views evolution as long intervals of near-stasis "punctuated" by short periods of rapid change. On the other hand, around the same time Wyatt Durham and Martin Glaessner both argued that the animal kingdom had a long Proterozoic history that was hidden by the lack of fossils. Whittington (1975) concluded that <i>Opabinia</i>, and other taxa such as <i>Marrella</i> and <i>Yohoia</i>, cannot be accommodated in modern groups. This was one of the primary reasons why Gould in his book on the Burgess Shale, <i>Wonderful Life</i>, considered that Early Cambrian life was much more diverse and "experimental" than any later set of animals and that the Cambrian explosion was a truly dramatic event, possibly driven by unusual evolutionary mechanisms. He regarded <i>Opabinia</i> as so important to understanding this phenomenon that he wanted to call his book <i>Homage to Opabinia</i>.<br><br>

However, other discoveries and evaluations soon followed, revealing similar-looking animals such as <i>Anomalocaris</i> from the Burgess Shale and <i>Kerygmachela</i> from Sirius Passet. Another Burgess Shale animal, <i>Aysheaia</i>, was considered very similar to modern <i>Onychophora</i>, which are regarded as close relatives of arthropods. Paleontologists defined a group called lobopods to include animals that are thought to be close relatives of arthropods but lack jointed limbs. There is still debate about whether lobopods are monophyletic, i.e. whether they include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, and about whether arthropods are a sub-group of lobopods or a sister-group.</div></div>

<i>Pikaia</i> was a primitive chordate that lacked a well-defined head and averaged about 1 1/2 inches (3.8 cm) in length. It had a pair of large, antenna-like tentacles on its head, and a series of short appendages, which may be linked to gill slits, on either side of its head. In these ways, it differs from the living lancelet. The "tentacles" on its head may be comparable to those in the present-day hagfish, a jawless chordate.<br><br><center><b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <a href="/">link</a></center><br>

Although primitive, <i>Pikaia</i> shows the essential prerequisites for vertebrates. When alive, <i>Pikaia</i> was a compressed, leaf-shaped animal with an expanded tail fin; the flattened body is divided into pairs of segmented muscle blocks, seen as faint vertical lines. The muscles lie on either side of a flexible structure resembling a rod that runs from the tip of the head to the tip of the tail. It likely swam by throwing its body into a series of S-shaped, zigzag curves, similar to the movement of eels; fish inherited the same swimming movement, but they generally have stiffer backbones. These adaptations may have allowed <i>Pikaia</i> to filter particles from the water as it swam along. <i>Pikaia</i> was probably a slow swimmer, since it lacked the fast-twitch fibers that are associated with rapid swimming in modern chordates.<br><br>

Conway Morris and Caron (2012) published an exhaustive description based on all 114 of the known fossil specimens; they discovered new and unexpected characteristics that they recognized as primitive features of the first chordate animals. On the basis of these findings, they constructed a new scenario for chordate evolution. Subsequently, Mallatt and Holland reconsidered Conway Morris and Caron's description, and concluded that many of the newly recognized characters are unique, already-divergent specializations that would not be helpful for establishing <i>Pikaia</i> as a basal chordate.

<i>P. gracilens</i> was discovered by Charles Walcott and first described by him in 1911. It was named after Pika Peak, a mountain in Alberta, Canada. Based on the obvious and regular segmentation of the body, Walcott classified it as a polychaete worm.<br><br>

During his re-examination of the Burgess Shale fauna in 1979, paleontologist Simon Conway Morris placed <i>P. gracilens</i> among the chordates, making it perhaps the oldest known ancestor of modern vertebrates. He did this because it seemed to have a very primitive, proto-notochord, however, the status of <i>Pikaia</i> as a chordate is not universally accepted; its preservational mode suggests that it had cuticle, which is uncharacteristic of the vertebrates (although characteristic of other cephalochordates); further, its tentacles are unknown from other vertebrate lineages. The presence of earlier chordates among the Chengjiang, including <i>Haikouichthys</i> and <i>Myllokunmingia</i>, appears to show that cuticle is not necessary for preservation, overruling the taphonomic argument, but the presence of tentacles remains intriguing, and the organism cannot be assigned conclusively, even to the vertebrate stem group. Its anatomy closely resembles the modern creature <i>Branchiostoma</i>.<br><br>

Much debate on whether <i>Pikaia</i> is a vertebrate ancestor, its worm-like appearance notwithstanding, exists in scientific circles. It looks like a worm that has been flattened sideways. The fossils compressed within the Burgess Shale show chordate features such as traces of an elongate notochord, dorsal nerve cord, and blocks of muscles (myotomes) down either side of the body – all critical features for the evolution of the vertebrates.

The notochord, a flexible rod-like structure that runs along the back of the animal, lengthens and stiffens the body so that it can be flexed from side to side by the muscle blocks for swimming. In the fish and all subsequent vertebrates, the notochord forms the backbone (or vertebral column). The backbone strengthens the body, supports strut-like limbs, and protects the vital dorsal nerve cord, while at the same time allowing the body to bend.<br><br>

A <i>Pikaia</i> lookalike, the lancelet <i>Branchiostoma</i>, still exists today. With a notochord and paired muscle blocks, the lancelet and <i>Pikaia</i> belong to the chordate group of animals from which the vertebrates descended. Molecular studies have refuted earlier hypotheses that lancelets might be the closest living relative to the vertebrates, instead favoring tunicates in this position; other living and fossil groups, such as acorn worms and graptolites, are more primitive.<br><br>

The presence of a creature as complex as <i>Pikaia</i> some 530 million years ago reinforces the controversial view that the diversification of life must have extended back well before Cambrian times – perhaps deep into the Precambrian.<br><br>

The first sign of head development, cephalization, is seen in chordates such as <i>Pikaia</i> and <i>Branchiostoma</i>. It is thought that development of a head structure resulted from a long body shape, a swimming habit, and a mouth at the end that came into contact with the environment first, as the animal swam forward. The search for food required ways of continually testing what lay ahead so it is thought that anatomical structures for seeing, feeling, and smelling developed around the mouth. The information these structures gathered was processed by a swelling of the nerve cord (efflorescence) – the precursor of the brain. Altogether, these front-end structures formed the distinct part of the vertebrate body known as the head.

<strong style="color: red;">LOOKING FOR THE "SAVE CHANGES" BUTTON????</strong> click <a href="/~fiziwhig#tspp">here</a> for instructions on how to find her<br><br><b>Bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, <strong>strong</strong>, <a href="/">link</a>.<br><br><i>Opabinia regalis</i> is an extinct, stem group arthropod found in the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale Lagerstätte of British Columbia, Canada. It flourished from 505 million years ago to 487 million years ago during the Cambrian Period of the Paleozoic Era. It measured 2-3 inches in length and is presumed to have been a carnivore. Fewer than twenty good specimens have been described; 3 specimens of <i>Opabinia</i> are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they constitute less than 0.1% of the community. <i>Opabinia</i> was a soft-bodied animal, averaging about 5.7 cm in length (excluding proboscis), and its segmented body had lobes along the sides and a fan-shaped tail. The head shows unusual features: five eyes, a mouth under the head and facing backwards, and a proboscis that probably passed food to the mouth. <i>Opabinia</i> probably lived on the seafloor, using the proboscis to seek out small, soft food.<br><br><font class="subheader">subheader</font>

When the first thorough examination of <i>Opabinia</i> in 1975 revealed its unusual features, it was thought to be unrelated to any known phylum, although possibly related to a hypothetical ancestor of arthropods and of annelid worms. However other finds, most notably <i>Anomalocaris</i>, suggested that it belonged to a group of animals that were closely related to the ancestors of arthropods and of which the living animals onychophorans and tardigrades may also be members.<br><br>

In the 1970s, there was an ongoing debate about whether multi-celled animals appeared suddenly during the Early Cambrian, in an event called the Cambrian explosion, or had arisen earlier but without leaving fossils. At first <i>Opabinia</i> was regarded as strong evidence for the "explosive" hypothesis. Later the discovery of a whole series of similar lobopod animals, some with closer resemblances to arthropods, and the development of the idea of stem groups suggested that the Early Cambrian was a time of relatively fast evolution but one that could be understood without assuming any unique evolutionary processes.

<i>Opabinia</i> looked so strange that the audience at the first presentation of Whittington's evaluation laughed. The length of <i>Opabinia</i> regalis from head to tail ranged between 4 centimetres (1.6 in) and 7 centimetres (2.8 in). The animal also had a hollow proboscis, whose total length was about one-third of the body's and projected down from under the head and then curved forwards and upwards. The proboscis was striated like a vacuum cleaner's hose and probably flexible, and it ended with a claw-like structure whose inner edges bore spines that projected inwards and forwards. The head bore five eyes: two on stalks near the front and fairly close to the middle of the head, pointing upwards and forwards; two larger eyes, also stalked, near the rear and outer edges of the head, pointing upwards and sideways; and a single eye with a shorter stalk between the larger pair of stalked eyes, pointing upwards. It has been assumed that the eyes were all compound, like arthropods' lateral eyes, but this reconstruction, which is not backed up by any evidence, is "somewhat fanciful". The mouth was under the head, behind the proboscis, and pointed backwards, so that the digestive tract formed a U-bend on its way towards the rear of the animal. The proboscis appeared sufficiently long and flexible to reach the mouth.<br><br>

The main part of the body was typically about 5 millimetres (0.20 in) wide and had 15 segments, on each of which there were pairs of lobes (flaps) pointing downwards and outwards. The lobes overlapped so that the front of each was covered by the rear edge of the one ahead of it. The body ended with what looked like a single conical segment bearing three pairs of overlapping lobes that pointed up and out, forming a tail like a V-shaped double fan.<br><br>

Interpretations of other features of <i>Opabinia</i> fossils differ. Since the animals did not have mineralized armor nor even tough organic exoskeletons like those of insects, their bodies were flattened as they were buried and fossilized, and smaller or internal features appear as markings within the outlines of the fossils.

Whittington interpreted as gills some markings on the upper surfaces of all lobes except the first on each side, and thought that these gills were flat underneath, had overlapping layers on top, and attached to the bases of the lobes. Budd (1996, 2011) thought they consisted of separate "blades" attached along the front edges on the undersides of the lobes. He also found marks inside the lobes' front edges that he interpreted as internal channels connecting the gills to the interior of the body, much as Whittington interpreted the mark along the proboscis as an internal channel. On the other hand, Bergström (1986) interpreted both the "gills" and the lobes as part of a covering over the upper surface of the body.<br><br>

Whittington found evidence of near-triangular features along the body, and concluded that they were internal structures, most likely sideways extensions of the gut. Chen et al. (1994) interpreted them as contained within the lobes along the sides. Budd thought the "triangles" were too wide to fit within <i>Opabinia</i>s slender body, and that cross-section views showed they were attached separately from and lower than the lobes, and extended below the body. He later found specimens that appeared to preserve the legs' exterior cuticle. He therefore interpreted the "triangles" as short, fleshy, conical legs. He also found small mineralized patches at the tips of some, and interpreted these as claws. Zhang and Briggs (2007) evaluated the chemical composition of the "triangles", and concluded that they had the same composition as the gut, and therefore agreed with Whittington that they were part of the digestive system. Instead they regarded <i>Opabinia</i>s lobe+gill arrangement as an early form of the biramous limbs seen in trilobites and crustaceans and which may be the original form in all arthropods. However, this similar chemical composition is not only associated with the digestive tract; Budd and Daley suggest that it represents mineralization forming within fluid-filled cavities within the body (consistent with hollow lobopod legs).<br><br>

The way in which the Burgess Shale animals were buried, by a mudslide or a sediment-laden current that acted as a sandstorm, suggests they lived on the surface of the seafloor. <i>Opabinia</i> probably used its proboscis to search the sediment for food particles and pass them to its mouth. Since there is no sign of anything that might function as jaws, its food was presumably small and soft. Whittington, believing that <i>Opabinia</i> had no legs, thought that it crawled on its lobes and that it could also have swum slowly by flapping the lobes, especially if it timed the movements to create "waves". On the other hand, he thought the body was not flexible enough to allow fish-like undulations of the whole body.

<i>Opabinia</i> made it clear how little was known about soft-bodied animals, which do not usually leave fossils. When Whittington described it in the mid-1970s, there was already a vigorous debate about the early evolution of animals. Preston Cloud argued in 1948 and 1968 that the process was "explosive", and in the early 1970s Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould developed their theory of punctuated equilibrium, which views evolution as long intervals of near-stasis "punctuated" by short periods of rapid change. On the other hand, around the same time Wyatt Durham and Martin Glaessner both argued that the animal kingdom had a long Proterozoic history that was hidden by the lack of fossils. Whittington (1975) concluded that <i>Opabinia</i>, and other taxa such as <i>Marrella</i> and <i>Yohoia</i>, cannot be accommodated in modern groups. This was one of the primary reasons why Gould in his book on the Burgess Shale, <i>Wonderful Life</i>, considered that Early Cambrian life was much more diverse and "experimental" than any later set of animals and that the Cambrian explosion was a truly dramatic event, possibly driven by unusual evolutionary mechanisms. He regarded <i>Opabinia</i> as so important to understanding this phenomenon that he wanted to call his book <i>Homage to Opabinia</i>.<br><br>

However, other discoveries and evaluations soon followed, revealing similar-looking animals such as <i>Anomalocaris</i> from the Burgess Shale and <i>Kerygmachela</i> from Sirius Passet. Another Burgess Shale animal, <i>Aysheaia</i>, was considered very similar to modern <i>Onychophora</i>, which are regarded as close relatives of arthropods. Paleontologists defined a group called lobopods to include animals that are thought to be close relatives of arthropods but lack jointed limbs. There is still debate about whether lobopods are monophyletic, i.e. whether they include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, and about whether arthropods are a sub-group of lobopods or a sister-group.

<b style="color: #FF0000;">LOOKING FOR THE "SAVE CHANGES" BUTTON???</b> click <a href="/~fiziwhig#tspp">here</a> for instructions on how to find it!<br><br><i>Opabinia regalis</i> is an extinct, stem group arthropod found in the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale Lagerstätte of British Columbia, Canada. It flourished from 505 million years ago to 487 million years ago during the Cambrian Period of the Paleozoic Era. It measured 2-3 inches in length and is presumed to have been a carnivore. Fewer than twenty good specimens have been described; 3 specimens of <i>Opabinia</i> are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they constitute less than 0.1% of the community. <i>Opabinia</i> was a soft-bodied animal, averaging about 5.7 cm in length (excluding proboscis), and its segmented body had lobes along the sides and a fan-shaped tail. The head shows unusual features: five eyes, a mouth under the head and facing backwards, and a proboscis that probably passed food to the mouth. <i>Opabinia</i> probably lived on the seafloor, using the proboscis to seek out small, soft food.<br><br><font class="subheader">» subheader</font>

When the first thorough examination of <i>Opabinia</i> in 1975 revealed its unusual features, it was thought to be unrelated to any known phylum, although possibly related to a hypothetical ancestor of arthropods and of annelid worms. However other finds, most notably <i>Anomalocaris</i>, suggested that it belonged to a group of animals that were closely related to the ancestors of arthropods and of which the living animals onychophorans and tardigrades may also be members.<br><br></div>

<i>Opabinia</i> looked so strange that the audience at the first presentation of Whittington's evaluation laughed. The length of <i>Opabinia</i> regalis from head to tail ranged between 4 centimetres (1.6 in) and 7 centimetres (2.8 in). The animal also had a hollow proboscis, whose total length was about one-third of the body's and projected down from under the head and then curved forwards and upwards. The proboscis was striated like a vacuum cleaner's hose and probably flexible, and it ended with a claw-like structure whose inner edges bore spines that projected inwards and forwards.<br><br>

The head bore five eyes: two on stalks near the front and fairly close to the middle of the head, pointing upwards and forwards; two larger eyes, also stalked, near the rear and outer edges of the head, pointing upwards and sideways; and a single eye with a shorter stalk between the larger pair of stalked eyes, pointing upwards. It has been assumed that the eyes were all compound, like arthropods' lateral eyes, but this reconstruction, which is not backed up by any evidence, is "somewhat fanciful". The mouth was under the head, behind the proboscis, and pointed backwards, so that the digestive tract formed a U-bend on its way towards the rear of the animal. The proboscis appeared sufficiently long and flexible to reach the mouth.

The main part of the body was typically about 5 millimetres (0.20 in) wide and had 15 segments, on each of which there were pairs of lobes (flaps) pointing downwards and outwards. The lobes overlapped so that the front of each was covered by the rear edge of the one ahead of it. The body ended with what looked like a single conical segment bearing three pairs of overlapping lobes that pointed up and out, forming a tail like a V-shaped double fan.

Interpretations of other features of <i>Opabinia</i> fossils differ. Since the animals did not have mineralized armor nor even tough organic exoskeletons like those of insects, their bodies were flattened as they were buried and fossilized, and smaller or internal features appear as markings within the outlines of the fossils.

Whittington interpreted as gills some markings on the upper surfaces of all lobes except the first on each side, and thought that these gills were flat underneath, had overlapping layers on top, and attached to the bases of the lobes. Budd (1996, 2011) thought they consisted of separate "blades" attached along the front edges on the undersides of the lobes. He also found marks inside the lobes' front edges that he interpreted as internal channels connecting the gills to the interior of the body, much as Whittington interpreted the mark along the proboscis as an internal channel. On the other hand, Bergström (1986) interpreted both the "gills" and the lobes as part of a covering over the upper surface of the body.

<td><strong>another one</strong><br>etc etc etc</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>hello</strong><br>here's another row i guess</td>
<td>bloop</td>
</tr></table></center></div>

Whittington found evidence of near-triangular features along the body, and concluded that they were internal structures, most likely sideways extensions of the gut. Chen et al. (1994) interpreted them as contained within the lobes along the sides. Budd thought the "triangles" were too wide to fit within <i>Opabinia</i>s slender body, and that cross-section views showed they were attached separately from and lower than the lobes, and extended below the body. He later found specimens that appeared to preserve the legs' exterior cuticle. He therefore interpreted the "triangles" as short, fleshy, conical legs. He also found small mineralized patches at the tips of some, and interpreted these as claws. Zhang and Briggs (2007) evaluated the chemical composition of the "triangles", and concluded that they had the same composition as the gut, and therefore agreed with Whittington that they were part of the digestive system. Instead they regarded <i>Opabinia</i>s lobe+gill arrangement as an early form of the biramous limbs seen in trilobites and crustaceans and which may be the original form in all arthropods. However, this similar chemical composition is not only associated with the digestive tract; Budd and Daley suggest that it represents mineralization forming within fluid-filled cavities within the body (consistent with hollow lobopod legs).<br><br>

The way in which the Burgess Shale animals were buried, by a mudslide or a sediment-laden current that acted as a sandstorm, suggests they lived on the surface of the seafloor. <i>Opabinia</i> probably used its proboscis to search the sediment for food particles and pass them to its mouth. Since there is no sign of anything that might function as jaws, its food was presumably small and soft. Whittington, believing that <i>Opabinia</i> had no legs, thought that it crawled on its lobes and that it could also have swum slowly by flapping the lobes, especially if it timed the movements to create "waves". On the other hand, he thought the body was not flexible enough to allow fish-like undulations of the whole body.

<i>Opabinia</i> made it clear how little was known about soft-bodied animals, which do not usually leave fossils. When Whittington described it in the mid-1970s, there was already a vigorous debate about the early evolution of animals. Preston Cloud argued in 1948 and 1968 that the process was "explosive", and in the early 1970s Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould developed their theory of punctuated equilibrium, which views evolution as long intervals of near-stasis "punctuated" by short periods of rapid change. On the other hand, around the same time Wyatt Durham and Martin Glaessner both argued that the animal kingdom had a long Proterozoic history that was hidden by the lack of fossils. Whittington (1975) concluded that <i>Opabinia</i>, and other taxa such as <i>Marrella</i> and <i>Yohoia</i>, cannot be accommodated in modern groups. This was one of the primary reasons why Gould in his book on the Burgess Shale, <i>Wonderful Life</i>, considered that Early Cambrian life was much more diverse and "experimental" than any later set of animals and that the Cambrian explosion was a truly dramatic event, possibly driven by unusual evolutionary mechanisms. He regarded <i>Opabinia</i> as so important to understanding this phenomenon that he wanted to call his book <i>Homage to Opabinia</i>.<br><br>

However, other discoveries and evaluations soon followed, revealing similar-looking animals such as <i>Anomalocaris</i> from the Burgess Shale and <i>Kerygmachela</i> from Sirius Passet. Another Burgess Shale animal, <i>Aysheaia</i>, was considered very similar to modern <i>Onychophora</i>, which are regarded as close relatives of arthropods. Paleontologists defined a group called lobopods to include animals that are thought to be close relatives of arthropods but lack jointed limbs. There is still debate about whether lobopods are monophyletic, i.e. whether they include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, and about whether arthropods are a sub-group of lobopods or a sister-group.

At first <i>Opabinia</i> was regarded as strong evidence for the "explosive" hypothesis. Later the discovery of a whole series of similar lobopod animals, some with closer resemblances to arthropods, and the development of the idea of stem groups suggested that the Early Cambrian was a time of relatively fast evolution but one that could be understood without assuming any unique evolutionary processes.

The main part of the body was typically about 5 millimetres (0.20 in) wide and had 15 segments, on each of which there were pairs of lobes (flaps) pointing downwards and outwards. The lobes overlapped so that the front of each was covered by the rear edge of the one ahead of it. The body ended with what looked like a single conical segment bearing three pairs of overlapping lobes that pointed up and out, forming a tail like a V-shaped double fan.<br><br>

Interpretations of other features of <i>Opabinia</i> fossils differ. Since the animals did not have mineralized armor nor even tough organic exoskeletons like those of insects, their bodies were flattened as they were buried and fossilized, and smaller or internal features appear as markings within the outlines of the fossils.

Whittington interpreted as gills some markings on the upper surfaces of all lobes except the first on each side, and thought that these gills were flat underneath, had overlapping layers on top, and attached to the bases of the lobes. Budd (1996, 2011) thought they consisted of separate "blades" attached along the front edges on the undersides of the lobes. He also found marks inside the lobes' front edges that he interpreted as internal channels connecting the gills to the interior of the body, much as Whittington interpreted the mark along the proboscis as an internal channel. On the other hand, Bergström (1986) interpreted both the "gills" and the lobes as part of a covering over the upper surface of the body.<br><br>

Whittington found evidence of near-triangular features along the body, and concluded that they were internal structures, most likely sideways extensions of the gut. Chen et al. (1994) interpreted them as contained within the lobes along the sides. Budd thought the "triangles" were too wide to fit within <i>Opabinia</i>s slender body, and that cross-section views showed they were attached separately from and lower than the lobes, and extended below the body. He later found specimens that appeared to preserve the legs' exterior cuticle. He therefore interpreted the "triangles" as short, fleshy, conical legs. He also found small mineralized patches at the tips of some, and interpreted these as claws. Zhang and Briggs (2007) evaluated the chemical composition of the "triangles", and concluded that they had the same composition as the gut, and therefore agreed with Whittington that they were part of the digestive system. Instead they regarded <i>Opabinia</i>s lobe+gill arrangement as an early form of the biramous limbs seen in trilobites and crustaceans and which may be the original form in all arthropods. However, this similar chemical composition is not only associated with the digestive tract; Budd and Daley suggest that it represents mineralization forming within fluid-filled cavities within the body (consistent with hollow lobopod legs).<br><br>

The way in which the Burgess Shale animals were buried, by a mudslide or a sediment-laden current that acted as a sandstorm, suggests they lived on the surface of the seafloor. <i>Opabinia</i> probably used its proboscis to search the sediment for food particles and pass them to its mouth. Since there is no sign of anything that might function as jaws, its food was presumably small and soft. Whittington, believing that <i>Opabinia</i> had no legs, thought that it crawled on its lobes and that it could also have swum slowly by flapping the lobes, especially if it timed the movements to create "waves". On the other hand, he thought the body was not flexible enough to allow fish-like undulations of the whole body.

It flourished from 505 million years ago to 487 million years ago during the Cambrian Period of the Paleozoic Era. It measured 2-3 inches in length and is presumed to have been a carnivore. Fewer than twenty good specimens have been described; 3 specimens of <i>Opabinia</i> are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they constitute less than 0.1% of the community. <i>Opabinia</i> was a soft-bodied animal, averaging about 5.7 cm in length (excluding proboscis), and its segmented body had lobes along the sides and a fan-shaped tail. The head shows unusual features: five eyes, a mouth under the head and facing backwards, and a proboscis that probably passed food to the mouth. <i>Opabinia</i> probably lived on the seafloor, using the proboscis to seek out small, soft food.

When the first thorough examination of <i>Opabinia</i> in 1975 revealed its unusual features, it was thought to be unrelated to any known phylum, although possibly related to a hypothetical ancestor of arthropods and of annelid worms. However other finds, most notably <i>Anomalocaris</i>, suggested that it belonged to a group of animals that were closely related to the ancestors of arthropods and of which the living animals onychophorans and tardigrades may also be members.<br><br>

In the 1970s, there was an ongoing debate about whether multi-celled animals appeared suddenly during the Early Cambrian, in an event called the Cambrian explosion, or had arisen earlier but without leaving fossils. At first <i>Opabinia</i> was regarded as strong evidence for the "explosive" hypothesis. Later the discovery of a whole series of similar lobopod animals, some with closer resemblances to arthropods, and the development of the idea of stem groups suggested that the Early Cambrian was a time of relatively fast evolution but one that could be understood without assuming any unique evolutionary processes.

<font class="subheader">subtitle</font></center><br><br><i>Opabinia</i> looked so strange that the audience at the first presentation of Whittington's evaluation laughed. The length of <i>Opabinia</i> regalis from head to tail ranged between 4 centimetres (1.6 in) and 7 centimetres (2.8 in). The animal also had a hollow proboscis, whose total length was about one-third of the body's and projected down from under the head and then curved forwards and upwards. The proboscis was striated like a vacuum cleaner's hose and probably flexible, and it ended with a claw-like structure whose inner edges bore spines that projected inwards and forwards. The head bore five eyes: two on stalks near the front and fairly close to the middle of the head, pointing upwards and forwards; two larger eyes, also stalked, near the rear and outer edges of the head, pointing upwards and sideways; and a single eye with a shorter stalk between the larger pair of stalked eyes, pointing upwards. It has been assumed that the eyes were all compound, like arthropods' lateral eyes, but this reconstruction, which is not backed up by any evidence, is "somewhat fanciful". The mouth was under the head, behind the proboscis, and pointed backwards, so that the digestive tract formed a U-bend on its way towards the rear of the animal. The proboscis appeared sufficiently long and flexible to reach the mouth.

It flourished from 505 million years ago to 487 million years ago during the Cambrian Period of the Paleozoic Era. It measured 2-3 inches in length and is presumed to have been a carnivore. Fewer than twenty good specimens have been described; 3 specimens of <i>Opabinia</i> are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they constitute less than 0.1% of the community. <i>Opabinia</i> was a soft-bodied animal, averaging about 5.7 cm in length (excluding proboscis), and its segmented body had lobes along the sides and a fan-shaped tail. The head shows unusual features: five eyes, a mouth under the head and facing backwards, and a proboscis that probably passed food to the mouth. <i>Opabinia</i> probably lived on the seafloor, using the proboscis to seek out small, soft food.

When the first thorough examination of <i>Opabinia</i> in 1975 revealed its unusual features, it was thought to be unrelated to any known phylum, although possibly related to a hypothetical ancestor of arthropods and of annelid worms. However other finds, most notably <i>Anomalocaris</i>, suggested that it belonged to a group of animals that were closely related to the ancestors of arthropods and of which the living animals onychophorans and tardigrades may also be members.<br><br>

In the 1970s, there was an ongoing debate about whether multi-celled animals appeared suddenly during the Early Cambrian, in an event called the Cambrian explosion, or had arisen earlier but without leaving fossils. At first <i>Opabinia</i> was regarded as strong evidence for the "explosive" hypothesis. Later the discovery of a whole series of similar lobopod animals, some with closer resemblances to arthropods, and the development of the idea of stem groups suggested that the Early Cambrian was a time of relatively fast evolution but one that could be understood without assuming any unique evolutionary processes.

<font class="subheader">subtitle</font></center><br><br><i>Opabinia</i> looked so strange that the audience at the first presentation of Whittington's evaluation laughed. The length of <i>Opabinia</i> regalis from head to tail ranged between 4 centimetres (1.6 in) and 7 centimetres (2.8 in). The animal also had a hollow proboscis, whose total length was about one-third of the body's and projected down from under the head and then curved forwards and upwards. The proboscis was striated like a vacuum cleaner's hose and probably flexible, and it ended with a claw-like structure whose inner edges bore spines that projected inwards and forwards. The head bore five eyes: two on stalks near the front and fairly close to the middle of the head, pointing upwards and forwards; two larger eyes, also stalked, near the rear and outer edges of the head, pointing upwards and sideways; and a single eye with a shorter stalk between the larger pair of stalked eyes, pointing upwards. It has been assumed that the eyes were all compound, like arthropods' lateral eyes, but this reconstruction, which is not backed up by any evidence, is "somewhat fanciful". The mouth was under the head, behind the proboscis, and pointed backwards, so that the digestive tract formed a U-bend on its way towards the rear of the animal. The proboscis appeared sufficiently long and flexible to reach the mouth.

The main part of the body was typically about 5 millimetres (0.20 in) wide and had 15 segments, on each of which there were pairs of lobes (flaps) pointing downwards and outwards. The lobes overlapped so that the front of each was covered by the rear edge of the one ahead of it. The body ended with what looked like a single conical segment bearing three pairs of overlapping lobes that pointed up and out, forming a tail like a V-shaped double fan.<br><br>

Interpretations of other features of <i>Opabinia</i> fossils differ. Since the animals did not have mineralized armor nor even tough organic exoskeletons like those of insects, their bodies were flattened as they were buried and fossilized, and smaller or internal features appear as markings within the outlines of the fossils.

Whittington interpreted as gills some markings on the upper surfaces of all lobes except the first on each side, and thought that these gills were flat underneath, had overlapping layers on top, and attached to the bases of the lobes. Budd (1996, 2011) thought they consisted of separate "blades" attached along the front edges on the undersides of the lobes. He also found marks inside the lobes' front edges that he interpreted as internal channels connecting the gills to the interior of the body, much as Whittington interpreted the mark along the proboscis as an internal channel. On the other hand, Bergström (1986) interpreted both the "gills" and the lobes as part of a covering over the upper surface of the body.<br><br>

Whittington found evidence of near-triangular features along the body, and concluded that they were internal structures, most likely sideways extensions of the gut. Chen et al. (1994) interpreted them as contained within the lobes along the sides. Budd thought the "triangles" were too wide to fit within <i>Opabinia</i>s slender body, and that cross-section views showed they were attached separately from and lower than the lobes, and extended below the body. He later found specimens that appeared to preserve the legs' exterior cuticle. He therefore interpreted the "triangles" as short, fleshy, conical legs. He also found small mineralized patches at the tips of some, and interpreted these as claws. Zhang and Briggs (2007) evaluated the chemical composition of the "triangles", and concluded that they had the same composition as the gut, and therefore agreed with Whittington that they were part of the digestive system. Instead they regarded <i>Opabinia</i>s lobe+gill arrangement as an early form of the biramous limbs seen in trilobites and crustaceans and which may be the original form in all arthropods. However, this similar chemical composition is not only associated with the digestive tract; Budd and Daley suggest that it represents mineralization forming within fluid-filled cavities within the body (consistent with hollow lobopod legs).<br><br>

The way in which the Burgess Shale animals were buried, by a mudslide or a sediment-laden current that acted as a sandstorm, suggests they lived on the surface of the seafloor. <i>Opabinia</i> probably used its proboscis to search the sediment for food particles and pass them to its mouth. Since there is no sign of anything that might function as jaws, its food was presumably small and soft. Whittington, believing that <i>Opabinia</i> had no legs, thought that it crawled on its lobes and that it could also have swum slowly by flapping the lobes, especially if it timed the movements to create "waves". On the other hand, he thought the body was not flexible enough to allow fish-like undulations of the whole body.

<font class="subheader">subtitle</font></center><br><br><i>Opabinia</i> made it clear how little was known about soft-bodied animals, which do not usually leave fossils. When Whittington described it in the mid-1970s, there was already a vigorous debate about the early evolution of animals. Preston Cloud argued in 1948 and 1968 that the process was "explosive", and in the early 1970s Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould developed their theory of punctuated equilibrium, which views evolution as long intervals of near-stasis "punctuated" by short periods of rapid change. On the other hand, around the same time Wyatt Durham and Martin Glaessner both argued that the animal kingdom had a long Proterozoic history that was hidden by the lack of fossils. Whittington (1975) concluded that <i>Opabinia</i>, and other taxa such as <i>Marrella</i> and <i>Yohoia</i>, cannot be accommodated in modern groups. This was one of the primary reasons why Gould in his book on the Burgess Shale, <i>Wonderful Life</i>, considered that Early Cambrian life was much more diverse and "experimental" than any later set of animals and that the Cambrian explosion was a truly dramatic event, possibly driven by unusual evolutionary mechanisms. He regarded <i>Opabinia</i> as so important to understanding this phenomenon that he wanted to call his book <i>Homage to Opabinia</i>.<br><br>

However, other discoveries and evaluations soon followed, revealing similar-looking animals such as <i>Anomalocaris</i> from the Burgess Shale and <i>Kerygmachela</i> from Sirius Passet. Another Burgess Shale animal, <i>Aysheaia</i>, was considered very similar to modern <i>Onychophora</i>, which are regarded as close relatives of arthropods. Paleontologists defined a group called lobopods to include animals that are thought to be close relatives of arthropods but lack jointed limbs. There is still debate about whether lobopods are monophyletic, i.e. whether they include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, and about whether arthropods are a sub-group of lobopods or a sister-group.

<b><i>Pikaia gracilens</i></b> is an extinct, primitive chordate animal known from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia. Sixteen specimens are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they comprised 0.03% of the community. It resembled the lancelet and perhaps swam much like an eel.</div>

<i>Pikaia</i> was a primitive chordate that lacked a well-defined head and averaged about 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) in length. It had a pair of large, antenna-like tentacles on its head, and a series of short appendages, which may be linked to gill slits, on either side of its head. In these ways, it differs from the living lancelet. The "tentacles" on its head may be comparable to those in the present-day hagfish, a jawless chordate.

<font class="subheader">description</font>

Although primitive, <i>Pikaia</i> shows the essential prerequisites for vertebrates. When alive, <i>Pikaia</i> was a compressed, leaf-shaped animal with an expanded tail fin; the flattened body is divided into pairs of segmented muscle blocks, seen as faint vertical lines. The muscles lie on either side of a flexible structure resembling a rod that runs from the tip of the head to the tip of the tail. It likely swam by throwing its body into a series of S-shaped, zigzag curves, similar to the movement of eels; fish inherited the same swimming movement, but they generally have stiffer backbones. These adaptations may have allowed <i>Pikaia</i> to filter particles from the water as it swam along. <i>Pikaia</i> was probably a slow swimmer, since it lacked the fast-twitch fibers that are associated with rapid swimming in modern chordates.<br><br>

Conway Morris and Caron (2012) published an exhaustive description based on all 114 of the known fossil specimens; they discovered new and unexpected characteristics that they recognized as primitive features of the first chordate animals. On the basis of these findings, they constructed a new scenario for chordate evolution. Subsequently, Mallatt and Holland reconsidered Conway Morris and Caron's description, and concluded that many of the newly recognized characters are unique, already-divergent specializations that would not be helpful for establishing <i>Pikaia</i> as a basal chordate.

<font class="subheader">discovery</font>

<i>P. gracilens</i> was discovered by Charles Walcott and first described by him in 1911. It was named after Pika Peak, a mountain in Alberta, Canada. Based on the obvious and regular segmentation of the body, Walcott classified it as a polychaete worm.<br><br>

During his re-examination of the Burgess Shale fauna in 1979, paleontologist Simon Conway Morris placed <i>P. gracilens</i> among the chordates, making it perhaps the oldest known ancestor of modern vertebrates. He did this because it seemed to have a very primitive, proto-notochord, however, the status of <i>Pikaia</i> as a chordate is not universally accepted; its preservational mode suggests that it had cuticle, which is uncharacteristic of the vertebrates (although characteristic of other cephalochordates); further, its tentacles are unknown from other vertebrate lineages. The presence of earlier chordates among the Chengjiang, including <i>Haikouichthys</i> and <i>Myllokunmingia</i>, appears to show that cuticle is not necessary for preservation, overruling the taphonomic argument, but the presence of tentacles remains intriguing, and the organism cannot be assigned conclusively, even to the vertebrate stem group. Its anatomy closely resembles the modern creature <i>Branchiostoma</i>.

<font class="subheader">evolution</font>

Much debate on whether <i>Pikaia</i> is a vertebrate ancestor, its worm-like appearance notwithstanding, exists in scientific circles. It looks like a worm that has been flattened sideways. The fossils compressed within the Burgess Shale show chordate features such as traces of an elongate notochord, dorsal nerve cord, and blocks of muscles (myotomes) down either side of the body – all critical features for the evolution of the vertebrates.<br><br>

The notochord, a flexible rod-like structure that runs along the back of the animal, lengthens and stiffens the body so that it can be flexed from side to side by the muscle blocks for swimming. In the fish and all subsequent vertebrates, the notochord forms the backbone (or vertebral column). The backbone strengthens the body, supports strut-like limbs, and protects the vital dorsal nerve cord, while at the same time allowing the body to bend.<br><br>

A <i>Pikaia</i> lookalike, the lancelet <i>Branchiostoma</i>, still exists today. With a notochord and paired muscle blocks, the lancelet and <i>Pikaia</i> belong to the chordate group of animals from which the vertebrates descended. Molecular studies have refuted earlier hypotheses that lancelets might be the closest living relative to the vertebrates, instead favoring tunicates in this position; other living and fossil groups, such as acorn worms and graptolites, are more primitive.<br><br>

The presence of a creature as complex as <i>Pikaia</i> some 530 million years ago reinforces the controversial view that the diversification of life must have extended back well before Cambrian times – perhaps deep into the Precambrian.

<font class="subheader">development of the head</font>

The first sign of head development, cephalization, is seen in chordates such as <i>Pikaia</i> and <i>Branchiostoma</i>. It is thought that development of a head structure resulted from a long body shape, a swimming habit, and a mouth at the end that came into contact with the environment first, as the animal swam forward. The search for food required ways of continually testing what lay ahead so it is thought that anatomical structures for seeing, feeling, and smelling developed around the mouth. The information these structures gathered was processed by a swelling of the nerve cord (efflorescence) – the precursor of the brain. Altogether, these front-end structures formed the distinct part of the vertebrate body known as the head.

The Burgess Shale contains the best record we have of Cambrian animal fossils. The locality reveals the presence of creatures originating from the Cambrian explosion, an evolutionary burst of animal origins dating 545 to 525 million years ago. During this period, life was restricted to the world's oceans. The land was barren, uninhabited, and subject to erosion; these geologic conditions led to mudslides, where sediment periodically rolled into the seas and buried marine organisms. At the Burgess locality, sediment was deposited in a deep-water basin adjacent to an enormous algal reef with a vertical escarpment several hundred meters high.<br><br>
The Burgess fauna contains many fossils of soft-bodied animals as well as those with hard parts. This is a tremendous opportunity for researchers because the soft bodied fossils are rarely found anywhere else — such organisms are usually destroyed before they can be preserved as fossils. When an organism is completely soft, the body usually rots away before it can become fossilized. Hard parts are important because they are more easily preserved; they help the organism last long enough to become fossilized.
</div>
<div class="middle">
The Burgess Shale has contributed significantly to the fossil record because of the large number of well preserved fossils found within its layers. These fossils exemplify a unique method of preservation. In most forms of fossilization, the body of a dead organism settles to the bottom of a river or lake whereupon sedimentation slowly covers the body. In the Burgess Shale however, organisms lived in underwater mud banks known as phyllopod beds. Water currents would periodically cause sediments to flow in the form of mudslides, quickly burying the living organism in moving sediment. Fossils are therefore found in random orientation, indicative of a violent mudslide engulfing many of the Cambrian organisms. There is also evidence that these organisms died instantly. First, in the presence of an anaerobic environment, such as mud, marine invertebrates normally curl up upon dying. Fossils of the Burgess Shale locality do not exhibit this coiling. Secondly, there is no evidence of any attempt by these organisms to burrow out of their mud "prison." Their lives having ended instantly due to the mudslides, preservation began immediately.
</div>
<div class="right">
The fossils of the Burgess Shale are spectacular, and many of them preserve exoskeletons, limbs, and infillings of the gut. In some rare fossils there is evidence of gut contents and muscle. For example, the internal organs are especially well preserved in the fossilized Ottoia worms. However, there are also many fossils that did not withstand geologic forces of the past 500 million years. Many empty shells have been found because the soft parts decayed and include Scenella and the brachiopods Lingulella and Diraphora. In the case of trilobites, entire exoskeletons have been found without appendages. These trilobites may have molted at the time of their death. The soft tissues of the appendages may have decayed along with the highly perishable body contents, and only the exoskeleton (shell) left behind became fossilized. Another arthropod, Canadaspis, is found in clusters. These clusters have a mixture of fossils exhibiting soft tissues and fossils exhibiting an absence of tissue. The mudslides may have brought moltings and whole animals together, another indication of the history of sediment flow in the Burgess Shale. The phyllopod bed is therefore exceptional for possessing both typical fossil bearing characteristics and unusual soft tissue preservation. This bed is highly important because it records the first appearance of organisms with hard parts in the fossil record.

<b><i>Anomalocaris</i></b> ("abnormal shrimp") is an extinct genus of anomalocaridid, a family of animals thought to be closely related to ancestral arthropods. The first fossils of <i>Anomalocaris</i> were discovered in the Ogygopsis Shale by Joseph Frederick Whiteaves, with more examples found by Charles Doolittle Walcott in the Burgess Shale. Originally several fossilized parts discovered separately (the mouth, feeding appendages and tail) were thought to be three separate creatures, a misapprehension corrected by Harry B. Whittington and Derek Briggs in a 1985 journal article.

<i>Anomalocaris</i> has been misidentified several times, in part due to its makeup of a mixture of mineralized and unmineralized body parts; the mouth and feeding appendage was considerably harder and more easily fossilized than the delicate body. Its name originates from a description of a detached 'arm', described by Joseph Frederick Whiteaves in 1892, as a separate crustacean-like creature due to its resemblance to the tail of a lobster or shrimp. The first fossilized anomalocaridid mouth was discovered by Charles Doolittle Walcott, who mistook it for a jellyfish and placed it in the genus <i>Peytoia</i>. Walcott also discovered a second feeding appendage, but failed to realize the similarities to Whiteaves' discovery and instead identified it as feeding appendage or tail of the extinct <i>Sidneyia</i>.

The body was discovered separately and classified as a sponge in the genus  <i>Laggania</i> ; a mouth was found with the body, but was interpreted by its discoverer Simon Conway Morris as an unrelated <i>Peytoia</i> that had through happenstance settled and been preserved with  <i>Laggania</i> . Later, while clearing what he thought was an unrelated specimen, Harry B. Whittington removed a layer of covering stone to discover the unequivocally connected arm thought to be a shrimp tail and mouth thought to be a jellyfish. Whittington linked the two species, but it took several more years for researchers to realize that the continuously juxtaposed <i>Peytoia</i>,  <i>Laggania</i>  and feeding appendage actually represented a single, enormous creature. The two genera are now placed into the family Anomalocaridae. Because <i>Peytoia</i> was named first, it became the correct name for the entire animal. The original feeding arm, however, came from a larger species distinct from <i>Peytoia</i> and <i>Laggania</i>, which retains the name <i>Anomalocaris</i>.

For the time in which it lived, <i>Anomalocaris</i> was gigantic, up to 1 metre (3.3 feet) long. It propelled itself through the water by undulating the flexible lobes on the sides of its body. Each lobe sloped below the one more posterior to it, and this overlapping allowed the lobes on each side of the body to act as a single "fin", maximizing the swimming efficiency. The construction of a remote-controlled model showed this mode of swimming to be intrinsically stable, implying that <i>Anomalocaris</i> would not have needed a complex brain to manage balance while swimming. The body was widest between the third and fifth lobe and narrowed towards the tail; it had at least 11 lobes in total. It is difficult to distinguish lobes near the tail, making an accurate count difficult.

</tr></table></center></div>


<i>Anomalocaris</i> had an unusual disk-like mouth. The mouth was composed of 32 overlapping plates, four large and 28 small, resembling a pineapple ring with the center replaced by a series of serrated prongs. The mouth could constrict to crush prey, but never completely close, and the tooth-like prongs continued down the walls of the gullet. Two large 'arms' (up to 18 centimetres (7.1 inches) in length when extended) with barb-like spikes were in front of the mouth. The tail was large and fan-shaped, and along with undulations of the lobes, was probably used to propel the creature through Cambrian waters. Stacked lamella of what were probably gills attached to the top of each lobe.

</div>

<div class="gray">The eyes were 30 times as powerful as those of trilobites; <i>Anomalocaris</i> is long thought to have had the most advanced eyes of any contemporary species. With 16,000 lenses, the resolution of the 3-centimetre-wide (1.2 in) eyes would have been rivalled only by that of the modern dragonfly, which has 28,000 lenses in each eye.</div>

<div class="body">

A long-standing view holds that <i>Anomalocaris</i> fed on hard-bodied animals, including trilobites—making it one of the first predators—and its mid-gut glands strongly suggest a predatory lifestyle. However, its ability to penetrate mineralised shells has been questioned. Some Cambrian trilobites have been found with round or W-shaped "bite" marks, which were identified as being the same shape as the mouthparts of <i>Anomalocaris</i>. Stronger evidence that <i>Anomalocaris</i> ate trilobites comes from coprolite, which contain trilobite parts and are so large that the anomalocarids are the only known organism from that period large enough to have produced them. However, since <i>Anomalocaris</i> lacks any mineralised tissue, it seemed unlikely that it would be able to penetrate the hard, calcified shell of trilobites. Rather, the coprolites may have been produced by a different organisms, such as the trilobites of the genus <i>Redlichia</i>.<br><br>

The lack of wear on anomalocaridid mouthparts suggests they did not come into regular contact with mineralised trilobite shells, and were possibly better suited to feeding on smaller, soft-bodied organisms by suction, since they would have experienced structural failure if they were used against the armour of trilobites. <i>A. canadensis</i> may have been capable of feeding on organisms with hard exoskeletons due to the short, robust spines on its appendages. However, as opposed to <i>Peytoia</i> whose mouthpiece is more rectangular with short protruding spines, the mouthpiece of <i>A. canadensis</i> has a smaller and more irregular diamond-shaped opening, not permitting strong biting motions, and indicating a suction-feeding behavior to suck in softer organisms.

sidebar over here! hello! hope you like it!!<br><br>
obviously feel free to switch out the image with something else, but i recommend keeping the image size (100x100) the way it is so that it's the same width as this here text column—if you do increase the image size, make sure the border radius (currently 50px) is still half the value of the width / height otherwise it won't be a perfect circle<br><br><b style="color: red;">help where did the "save changes" button go</b><br>
yes, this happens - zoom out by hitting Ctrl + the minus sign until it appears in the center of the page, near the top

<font class="header">Overview</font>

<b>Wiwaxia</b> is a genus of <a href="/">soft-bodied animals</a> that were covered in carbonaceous scales and spines that protected it from predators. <i>Wiwaxia</i> fossils – mainly isolated scales, but sometimes complete, articulated fossils – are known from early Cambrian and middle Cambrian fossil deposits across the globe. The living animal would have measured up to 5 cm (2 inch) when fully grown, although a range of juvenile specimens are known, the smallest being 2 millimetres (0.079 in) long.

Wiwaxia's affinity has been a matter of debate: researchers were long split between two possibilities. On the one hand, its rows of scales looked superficially similar to certain scale worms (annelids); conversely, its mouthparts and general morphology suggested a relationship to the shell-less molluscs. More recently, evidence for a molluscan affinity has been compiling, based on new details of Wiwaxia's mouthparts, scales, and growth history.

Wiwaxia was bilaterally symmetrical; viewed from the top the body was elliptical with no distinct head or tail, and from the front or rear it was almost rectangular. It reached 5 centimetres (2.0 in) in length. Estimating their height is difficult because specimens were compressed after death; a typical specimen may have been 1 centimetre (0.39 in) high excluding the spines on their backs. The ratio of width to length does not appear to change as the animals grew.

</tr></table></center></div>

Wiwaxia's flat underside was soft and unarmored; most of the surface was occupied by a slug-like foot. Little is known of the internal anatomy, although the gut apparently ran straight and all the way from the front to the rear. At the front end of the gut, about 5 millimetres (0.20 in) from the animal's front in an average specimen about 2.5 centimetres (0.98 in) long, there was a feeding apparatus that consisted of two (or in rare large specimens three) rows of backward-pointing conical teeth. The feeding apparatus was tough enough to be frequently preserved, but unmineralized and fairly flexible.

<font class="header">Sclerites</font>

The animal was covered in eight rows of small ribbed armor plates called sclerites; these lay flat against the body, overlapped so that the rear of one covered the front of the one behind, and formed five main regions — the top; the upper part of the sides; the lower part of the sides; the front; and the bottom. Most of the sclerites were shaped like oval leaves, but the ventro-lateral ones, nearest the sea-floor, were crescent-shaped, rather like flattened bananas, and formed a single row. Larger specimens (greater than ~15mm) bear two rows of ribbed spines running from front to rear, one along each side of the top surface, and projecting out and slightly upwards, with a slight upwards curve near the tips. Although the spines in the middle of each row are usually the longest, up to 5 centimetres (2.0 in) long, a few specimens have rather short middle spines that represent part-grown replacements.<br><br>

Each sclerite was rooted separately in the body; the roots of body sclerites are 40% of the external length or a little less, while the roots of the spines are a little over 25% of the external length; all were rooted in pockets in the skin, rather like the follicles of mammalian hair. The roots of the body sclerites were significantly narrower than the sclerites, but the spines had roots about as wide as their bases; both types of root were made of fairly soft tissue. They bore protrusive, presumably structural, ribs on their upper and (seemingly) lower surfaces.:544 The sclerites and spines were not mineralized, but made of a tough organic (carbon-based) biopolymer. Butterfield (1990) examined some sclerites under both optical and scanning electron microscopes and concluded that they were not hollow, and that the bases split and spread to form the blades, a pattern that is also seen in monocot leaves.  The sclerites bear an internal fabric of longitudinal chambers, which suggest that they were secreted from their bases in the manner of Lophotrochozoan sclerites.

Wiwaxia's scleritome comprises eight rows of sclerites, arranged in bundles. Sclerites are periodically shed and replaced during growth, with the number of sclerites in a given bundle increasing as the animal ages to produce a thicker scleritome. Once specimens reach a certain size, spines are added to the scleritome; this size is ~15 mm in W. corrugata but substantially smaller in W. taijengensis. One juvenile specimen was originally interpreted as molting, but in fact represents a single, folded individual.

The long dorsal spines may have been a defense against predators. Wiwaxia apparently moved by contractions of a slug-like foot on its underside. In one specimen a small brachiopod, Diraphora bellicostata, appears to be attached to one of the ventro-lateral sclerites. This suggests that adult Wiwaxia did not burrow or even plough much into the sea-floor as they moved. Two other specimens of Diraphora bellicostata have been found attached to dorsal sclerites. Wiwaxia appears to have been solitary rather than gregarious. The feeding apparatus may have acted as a rasp to strip bacteria off the top of the microbial mat that covered the sea-floor, or as a rake to gather food particles from the sea-floor.

<div class="text">

Wiwaxia was originally described by G.F. Matthew in 1899, from an isolated spine that had been found earlier in the Ogyopsis Shale, and classified as "Orthotheca corrugata". Further specimens were found by American paleontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott in 1911 as a result of one of his field trips to the nearby Burgess Shale (Miaolingian, 508 million years ago) in the Canadian Rocky Mountains; he classified it as a member of the polychaete group of annelid worms in its own genus Wiwaxia corrugata, citing similarities to the Aphroditidae and Polynoidae.<br><br>

In 1966 and 1967 a team led by Harry B. Whittington revisited the Burgess Shale and found so many fossils that it took years to evaluate them all. 464 complete specimens of Wiwaxia are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they comprise 0.88% of the community. Eventually in 1985 Simon Conway Morris, then a member of Whittington's team, published a detailed description and concluded that Wiwaxia was not a polychaete. All the known specimens came from in and around the Burgess Shale until 1991, when fragmentary fossils were reported from Australia's Georgina Basin. In 2004 additional finds which may represent two different species were reported from the same area.

<i>opabinia</i> was a soft-bodied animal, averaging about 5.7 cm in length (excluding proboscis), and its segmented body had lobes along the sides and a fan-shaped tail. The head shows unusual features: five eyes, a mouth under the head and facing backwards, and a proboscis that probably passed food to the mouth. <i>opabinia</i> probably lived on the seafloor, using the proboscis to seek out small, soft food.

<strong>Peytoia</strong> is a genus of anomalocarids that lived in the Cambrian period, containing two species, <i>Peytoia nathorsti</i> and <i>Peytoia infercambriensis</i>.

Paleontologists have determined that these attributes disqualify <i>Peytoia</i> from apex predator status (as opposed to <i>Anomalocaris</i>), to the extent that it used its appendages to filter water and sediment on the sea floor to find food.

<strong>Peytoia</strong> is a genus of anomalocarids that lived in the Cambrian period, containing two species, <i>Peytoia nathorsti</i> and <i>Peytoia infercambriensis</i>. Its two mouth appendages had long bristle-like spines, it had no fan tail, and its short stalked eyes were behind its mouth appendages.<br><br>

Paleontologists have determined that these attributes disqualify <i>Peytoia</i> from apex predator status (as opposed to <i>Anomalocaris</i>), to the extent that it used its appendages to filter water and sediment on the sea floor to find food.

Pikaia was a primitive chordate that lacked a well-defined head and averaged about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in length. It had a pair of large, antenna-like tentacles on its head, and a series of short appendages, which may be linked to gill slits, on either side of its head. The "tentacles" on its head may be comparable to those in the present-day hagfish, a jawless chordate.<br><br><b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, <a href="/">link</a>

<strong>Opabinia</strong> was a soft-bodied animal, averaging about 5.7 cm in length (excluding proboscis), and its segmented body had lobes along the sides and a fan-shaped tail. The head shows unusual features: five eyes, a mouth under the head and facing backwards, and a proboscis that probably passed food to the mouth. <i>Opabinia</i> probably lived on the seafloor, using the proboscis to seek out small, soft food.

i had to change them to round brackets because the code has to be under 4,000 characters, but the neopets filter recognizes any style tag as the beginning of a stylesheet and automatically adds indents, linebreaks, and spaces, even within a textarea, taking up valuable character space. so it is <b style="color: red;">very important</b> that the block of css remains the way it is, no spaces or line breaks or anything else unless they absolutely need to be there, otherwise it'll end up being more than 4,000 characters. srry for any inconvenience!!</td>

this is a very common problem. the easiest fix is to zoom out by hitting ctrl + the minus sign (or command + the minus sign, if you're using a mac) until the button reappears, usually near the top of the page and almost always in the center. however, this does not always work. the solution that <i>does</i> always work is a little more elaborate, and i've laid out the steps here:<br><br><br><center><span style="color: red; text-transform: uppercase;">(i know this looks complicated but it will take u like 2.5 seconds once u get the hang of it)</span></center>

in some of my older lookups, all <font class="codesnippet">b</font> and <font class="codesnippet">img</font> elements (except for those within userlookup content modules and text boxes designated for an "about me" section) are hidden by default to get rid of the pesky title at the top of every userlookup. to rectify this, you can add <font class="codesnippet">style="visibility: visible;</font> to whatever <font class="codesnippet">b</font> or <font class="codesnippet">img</font> element isn't showing up. your code should look like this:

<h1>Pet lookup troubles</h1><br><div class="narrow" style="width: 450px;">

<center><b class="big">Neopets is saying my opening and closing style tags dont match but i checked and they definitely do!!!</b></center><br>

it is SO ANNOYING when this happens and i dont know exactly why it does, but if u <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=aquaeri&amp;subject=pet%2520lookup%2520troubles">neomail me</a> i can fix it for u. sorry!!!!<br><br><br><br><center><b class="big">Neopets is saying my code is longer than 4,000 characters!</b></center><br>

chances are this is because the stylesheet has a bunch of unnecessary spaces, line breaks, and indents in it — this often happens if you put the code in a textarea (on a petpage, for example) without changing the pointy brackets in <font class="codesnippet">(style)</font> and <font class="codesnippet">(/style)</font> to round brackets, which provokes deranged code mynci to run through the code and reformat everything.<br><br>

if u <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=aquaeri&amp;subject=pet%2520lookup%2520troubles">neomail me</a> i can unformat it for u, but if u wanna try doing it urself, my method is to open <i>just the stylesheet</i> in a word doc — i.e. everything between <font class="codesnippet">(style)</font> and <font class="codesnippet">(/style)</font> — and make the following replacements (using ctrl + f for "find and replace"):<br><br><br><i>getting rid of unnecessary spaces:</i>
<ul><li>replace <font class="codesnippet">, </font> (comma plus a space) with <font class="codesnippet">,</font> (comma by itself)</li>
<li>replace <font class="codesnippet">: </font> (colon plus a space) with <font class="codesnippet">:</font> (colon by itself)</li>
<li>replace <font class="codesnippet">  {</font> (space plus opening bracket) with <font class="codesnippet">{</font> (opening bracket by itself)</li>
</ul><br><br><i>getting rid of unnecessary line breaks and indents:</i>
<ul><li>replace <textarea class="tssnippet">{
	</textarea> (opening bracket + line break + indent) with <font class="codesnippet">{</font>
(opening bracket by itself)</li>
<li>replace <textarea class="tssnippet">;
	</textarea> (semicolon + line break + indent) with <font class="codesnippet">;</font>
(semicolon by itself)</li>
<li>replace <textarea class="tssnippet">}
</textarea> (closing bracket + line break) with <font class="codesnippet">}</font>
(closing bracket by itself)</li>
</ul><br><br><i>last step:</i>
<ul><li>replace <font class="codesnippet">;}</font> with <font class="codesnippet">}</font>.</li>
