	<div class="bio" style="position: relative;">
		<p>A refined and straightlaced authority figure of the house, she tries to keep things in order and she tends to be very harsh and critical. Kuve is stoic, intelligent and fearless when it comes to lecturing, but also fearless when it comes to imposing hopes of improvement on others. She is intensely well meaning, but perhaps too intense for some. Once a fanciful young girl in a mansion who dreamed of faeries, she ran off and was readily disappointed, and since then has been nothing but a realist - she only pursues goals and encourages others when she knows they can be achieved - so you'd better not let her down!
</p>
<p>Kuviera is not a natural faerie; she was zapped that way with the lab ray (but then, who is "natural born" anything these days?) Technically she is an adult but looks exceptionally young. Her petite and youthful looks are something she is begrudgingly proud of, but the disrespect she gets for being mistaken for a teen often results in snippiness. She tries to dress and act her best at all times to deter such issues, but sure enough she isn't one to back down from argument if it crops up. She does have the tendency to make things sound worse than they are (especially regarding money) but it's hard to say she's unhappier than she was in the past. She has the family now, after all, and for their sakes there isn't time to mope. Life's all right. It could be worse. She likes to say that.</p>

	<img src="http://twgp.us/images/res/kuve_3_zpsf39286cd.jpg"><p class="person"><b>re: <a href="/~misadori">Misadori</a></b> <br>They probably couldn't be more different than they are, business lady and wild tiger, but time and a lot of unlucky situations has kept them tied together somehow. Their meeting was definitely a bit of oil and water, with the curious mountain bandit constantly peeking in on the lost private-school runaway who had no way of returning home. But Misa became Kuvirea's first real protector and confidante at her darkest time.
<br>Kuve is sort of a stick in the mud even today, but she's sensitive enough to know Misa's intentions are always trying to get her to feel better. In response for her friendship during the worst of times, Kuvirea trusts Misadori with a heck of a lot more than most people would. By that influence, despite what her appearances suggest, Kuve often has more trust for those who are straightforward or rough around the edges than the typical refined upperclass. Misa being the way she is, important chores sometimes end up a little messy, but Kuve covers for her knowing that Misa will ultimately not let her down when push comes to shove, and Kuve probably would have no real fun in life - maybe even life at all - without her.
</p>
	<img src="http://twgp.us/images/res/kuve_4_zps5cb15c12.jpg"><p class="person"><b>re: <a href="/~kieruu">Kieruu</a></b> <br>Most would say she's more of a boss than a mom figure, but nonetheless Kuve found herself caring for a kid who would later be adoped as a son, K. They make a very contented combination and a terror for competition: Kuve is a strict parent and one of those who has huge ambitions for the kid, but K has been able to keep up thus far, and this makes her proud. One thing though, she does worry a lot for his safety. He was mute and withdrawn when she found him and and has shielded him from a lot of the real world as a result despite his growth. K's the kind to want to protect his family, eventually, but is he prepared?</p>

<p class="person"><b>re: <a href="/~saohme">Saohme</a></b> <br>A childhood schoolmate of Kuvirea's from the countryside mansion, back when she was more adventurous and he would do anything she said. They haven't been in touch though, as in their final school year they made the unwise decision to run away and during that trip, Sao was whisked away from camp in a dangerous area. When he turned up in their city years later, she obviously felt some old sentiments, and regret, but she's smarter than before; despite some inclinations to take care of him there's obviously something different, and not right. Their relationship is pretty cordial these days, she's more of a mindful landlord than a true friend. However, they still have some things in common. From taking the same etiquette classes as kids, Kuve and Sao are both the kind to dress well and behave in public, even if they're inwardly on edge or not really feeling social.<br><br>Kuvirea may be more fond for Sao out of history than many others, and secretly wish to apologize for years apart, but K is probably more important to her. And Sao's bad influence on the kid gets no marks there.

	<img src="http://twgp.us/images/res/kuve_5_zpsff7d26a6.jpg"><p class="person"><b>re: <a href="/~3quest">3quest</a></b> <br>Kuvirea's not known for her friendliness, and has the cold belief that a lot of misfortune comes only because of oneself_  but when faced with trouble in person she does have an impulse to help those (of a particular type) she sees in need. So that's what 3quest got, when she was just a simple soft-spoken coworker who had a sort of shy admiration but never the kind to follow up on anything. Kuvirea helped her move up in the world and in confidence, and gained a loyal, casual companion there.<br><br>
3quest also reminds her a little of Misadori? Tall, association with green and white, but missing the self assurance. Hm...</p>

	<div class="scrap">
		<img src="//images.neopets.com/pets/closeattack/kacheek_faerie_left.gif" width="80" style="float: right;"><p><b>Working notes</b>: Her age specifics are a little flaky but she got to the city when she was ~14 and when she "became" faerie she got kinda stuck, she's adult age but looks like an angry teenager. In actual age shes really a little older than Misadori...</p>
<p>The way I color is very much attributed to trying to work around a purple and orange character. She was blue to begin with and was one of my first pets so I was thinking of making her a blue faerie, but actually faerie kacheeks have a pretty pleasant color scheme. So I started to think of a way to combine her colors and with pink in between it kind of works. Not really a combination I did for any character or drawing before her but hey I use those two all the time now.</p>
<p>She's my only non-bird petsite char who can fly, but not far or high; she's easily pushed by wind. From the ground to first/second storey window would be alright. But up a skysc<span>r</span>aper or between towns, not going to happen.</p>

	I went on NC warpath for a few weeks summer 2013 and got most of my old wishlist out of the way. I also ended up with a lot of things I don't use over the years, so I did another dressup with that stuff. Playing around is what the extra clothes are there for, I guess. Kuve looks so different in non-black/pink/purple.</p>

	<p>I really like tree wearables. I started trading NC to get some trees and now everyone has a tree of their own. Family trees.</p>
