        AKA the 6 things you should do everyday to make bank

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Since I spend so much time on the HC (Help Chat) I see the million neopoint question of how to make
        neopoints at least once a day. I've decided to make this petpage so that I can easily link to it instead of
        typing everything out everytime. Please share this page if it helps you. </p>
    <p>
        Neopets links are clickable, Jellyneo links are not. The headers are clickable and take you to the relevant
        page.</p>
    <p> While this is not intended as a comprehensive guide, I try to touch on as many FAQs as possible, and I link
        to guides with more info as needed.</p><p> Page last updated: December 15th 2023</p>

<h2><a href="//www.neopets.com/trudys_surprise.phtml">1. Trudy's Surprise</a></h2>

    <p>
        <b>Profit:</b> ~500k per month
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Who should do this:</b> Everyone!!
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How:</b> It is cmulative so you must log in daily to spin it. Every 25 consecutive days will reward you
        with 100k. Add that to all the neopoints you earned in the previous 24 days and you'll average 500k a month.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Trudy notification has been inconsistent since the switch to the Beta theme so I suggest reminding
        yourself to spin it another way. For me, I have it included in my dailies bookmarks folder that I run
        through daily. Do whatever works for you. 
    </p>
    <p>
<b>Avatar:</b> Awarded the first time you recieve 100k</p>
    <p><b>Trophy:</b> NA

    <h2><a href="//www.neopets.com/questlog/">2. Quest Log</a></h2>

    <p>
        <b>Profit:</b> highly variable with a minimum of 620k per month
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Who should do this:</b> Everyone!!
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How:</b> This is new as of late 2023. I am only taking into account here the guaranteed 20k awarded everyday for completing the quests. There is the potentional to make much, much more off of the prizes, especially if you stay consistent and claim the weekly grand prizes. 

</p><p> It is worth noting that the quests themselves can cost neopoints, but this is greatly outweighed by the profit, so I consider it negligible. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For more info on the quest log, and to troubleshoot any issues, I suggest this petpage: <a href="//www.neopets.com/~lydhyn">~lydhyn</a>

    <h2><a href="//www.neopets.com/dome/index.phtml?rndno=86">3. Battledome</a></h2>
    <p><b>Profit:</b> ~500k to 1.5mil per month</p><p></p>
    <p>
        <b>Who should do this:</b> Everyone, but best once you can afford to train a pet.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How:</b> You can only make 1500nps a day battling, but you can make much more than that selling your 15
        daily prizes. As you are starting out, do whatever 1P battles your pet can manage.
    </p>
    <p>

        Your end goal should be to predictably beat Koi Warrior, or Jetsam Ace if you have premium. If those are too
        strong, work your way up the Kreludan Defender Robot first.</p>
    <p>
        Here is a comprehensive guide on training and battling: <a href="//www.neopets.com/~SilverCyanide4">~SilverCyanide4</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        And here is a more up-to-date guide for selecting equipment:

    <h2><a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/foodclub.phtml?type=bet">4. Food Club</a></h2>
    <p><b> Profit:</b> Depends on account age. Generally you will average a profit of 1.8x what you bet. With my 18 year old account, that's around 2.5mil per month. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Who should do this: </b> Everyone can do this, but it's especially good for those with accounts 100
        months or older. I suggest you wait until you have enough neopoints to afford to "tank" (lose everything you
        bet) at least 4 times in a row.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How:</b> I suggest everyone starting out follows an established bettor. Many people post their bets daily
        for others to copy. Here are two of the most popular and best for the average person:
    </p>
    <p>
        Garet: <a href="//www.neopets.com/~boochi_target">~Boochi_Target</a><br>
        Lefty: <a href="//www.neopets.com/~innocent">~Innocent</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Garet is particularly good for beginners because he's quite conservative (plays it safe) and explains his
        bets everyday. Even if you don't plan to follow him, his page is worth a thorough read.
    </p><p>Bets are designed to work together, so you must place all 10.</p>
    <p>
        So many people consistently post their bets everyday that there's no need to ever learn the mechanics of the
        game or how to bet yourself, unless you want to.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a betting game akin to horse racing, except in this case it's an eating contest. The game is RIGGED
        POSITIVELY so if you know what you're doing, or copy someone who does, you will always profit OVER TIME.
        Most established bettors have a lifetime RTO (return on investment) of about 1.8x what they put in.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're feeling overwhelmed, here is a guide on how to follow a betting page:
        <a href="//www.neopets.com/~orvinnthefirstmate">~OrvinnTheFirstMate</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        There is always an active board on the Help Chat called "Do You Play Food Club" that lists guides, bettors
        to follow, and is a good place to go if you have any questions. There is also an active board on the Games
        Chat.
    </p>
    <p>
        As this is a betting game, sometimes you will lose everything you put in. Sometimes you'll lose everything
        for days in a row. But eventually you'll win it all back, and then some. As I said, unlike a normal betting
        game or horse races, this is rigged positively, and you will always profit over time. There's no reason not
        to do it, and if you have an aged account and aren't doing you're missing out considerably.

        <b>Trophy:</b> High score is based on how many neopoints you collect at one time. See Garet's page for more
        info.
    </p>


    <h2><a href="//www.neopets.com/stockmarket.phtml?type=portfolio">5. Stock Market</a></h2>
    <p>
        <b>Profit:</b> approx 300% of your investment, depending on sell point.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Who should do this:</b> Everyone once you can afford to spend 15k a day.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How:</b> Put simply, buy low, sell high. The minimum you can normally* buy at is 15nps/share. Then you
        wait, sometimes months or even years, until it reaches your sell point. You can choose any sell point you
        want, but to get the most out of it I suggest no lower than 60nps/share or 300%. I sell around 75nps/share.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is extremely, extremely slow, but like Food Club if you stick with it you'll always profit. Buy 1000
        shares of a stock at 15nps/share everyday and then wait, it's that easy.</p>
    <p>If there aren't any stocks at 15nps/share, you can wait and check back later, or buy at 16 or 17nps/share. In
        the grand scheme of things, the few neopoints difference doesn't matter, and it's better to buy higher than
        not buy at all.</p>
    <p>
        *There is an Obelisk boon that allows you to buy stocks at 10nps/share for one week. More info on the
        Obelisk and boons here:

    <h2><a href="//www.neopets.com/~ixiniva">6. Dailies</a></h2>

    <p>
        Most people know to do dailies, however not all dailies are created equal. While you're just starting out it
        may be worth it to do all of them, here is a list of dailies that I consider worth doing. </p>
    <p> <b>Free, no risk:</b> <br>Fruit Machine<br>Anchor Management</p>
    <p><b>Small charge, no risk:</b><br>Forgotten Shore <br> Faerie Caverns<br>Wishing Well<br>Test Your
        Strength<br>Coconut Shy</p>
    <p><b>Free, some risk:</b><br> Expellibox (can make your pet sick)<br>Discarded Magical Grundo Plushie (can make
        your pet sad)</p>
    <p> I'm going to eventually update this section to give more details on the dailies, as well as to list others
        than are good to do for the chance at a trophy. But rn I'm tired. </p>
    <p>

    </p>


 <h2><a href="//www.neopets.com/bank.phtml">Bonus: Bank Interest</a></h2>

    <p>
        This is less a "tip" and more some encouragement. When you don't have a lot of neopoints, bank interest can
        seem kind of useless, but it shouldn't be dismissed too quickly. While I do believe to get the most out of
        this site you should start with goals other than hoarding neopoints, there is value in having a lot in your
        bank. Get into the habit early of collecting interest everyday, and slowly but surely it'll add up.
