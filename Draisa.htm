carefree | quirky | serene | vivacious<br>
A regular competitor at all of Neopia's surfing competitions, although the circuit may not be Neopian Times worthy, she loves it anyways. Mystery Island has the best waves for practice, enjoyment and trophies. PETPET fills the role of Fara's trainor, assistant, and best friend. Never will you find these two ladies far from the other. When not surfing (a rarity) Ara and PETPET can be found combing the beach for shells and creatures that need to be tossed back into the water. May consider attempting the Snowboarding circuit in the off months, to keep her competitive edge.

bashful | fragile | perceptive | studious<br>
I don't get too many visitors, nor do I want them. I prefer to play by myself or with my two siblings, and Rose of course. Just don't touch anything without asking, for your health of course. Since I am studying the constellations, (with Riva) I have some weird stuff from my other classes stuffed around in my room. -holds up petpet- Isn't he cute? I drag him along with me everywhere, kinda like a teddy bear. -hugglesquishes until petpet's eyes bulge- If you look at my pretty pretty picture below, you will notice a star over my left eye, I only wish it was real, cause I LOVE stars. That's why I put up with Riva's lessons, cause she knows a lot about the beautiful things in the night sky. Well, it's my nap time, so if you will skedaddle I will climb into my crib so I can be alert later tonight. Bye!

Daring, Experienced, Determined, Strong <br>
Dana is a message courier, and often delivers messages that no other courier dares to deliver. She's able to scale mountains, survive deserts, and run very verrrry fast in order to avoid danger.<br><b>Art credit to hzoo_26</b>

<img src="http://openneo-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/outfits/001/495/774/small_preview.png" style="padding-right: 5px; float: left;"><h5>Fai - The Dainty Princess Agent</h5>
strong | chic | stealthy | witty<br>
She is poison to the weak and an aphrodisiac to the strong. She takes no prisoners, and never gets caught. She may appear to be purple to the untrained eye, but as soon as she needs it, her camouflage comes into play and she disapears into the background. <br>
Fai is an undercover agent for the Defenders of Neopia; and wants to keep it that way; so if you tell anyone, she may have to take you out next...  <br>
By being the mover and shaker behind the scenes, she has helped to take out some of Neopias most famous villians. It was her groundwork that ultimatly stopped Dr Sloth's latest hostile takeover attempt. Before that she had laid low Galem, Commander Garoo, and Hubrid Nox. Fai as of yet hasn't been able to catch up to that sneaky usul known as the Shadow.

brave | flippant | inquisitive | sophisticated<br>
Some have called me the female "Bobba Fett" but I haven't the slightest what they mean. I just do my job day to day. What is my job you ask? I am a bounty Hunter. I find those pesky Neopets that haven't paid their taxes, stolen from others, and even... those guilty of murder. Gli is my companion through thick and thin, and we have seen some rough times. Just before the fall of Faerieland, things were really quiet, and therefore not a lot for me to do. It's a good thing I have OWNER to rely upon for a cot and a meal when I can't rustle up my own. Now, head out of here so I can nap, or I'll zap you with my laser gun...

Creepy, Intelligent, Kind, Ladylike<br>
She tends to get very nervous in crowds, so doesn't like going to the bazaar like the rest of the family, but loves to be included in family activities. More often than not, found in the library sneaking in another adventure story. Interestingly, she is afraid of the dark, although she likes to explore small nooks and crannies. (which usually gets her in trouble!) Will answer pretty much any trivia question thrown her way. <br><b>Art credit to hzoo_26</b>

distant | intelligent | romantic | tolerant<br>
She always has her eyes to the sky, and has mapped several new constellations. She studied in Altador and then in Shenkuu<br><br>
Her petpet is incredibly rude and cutting, but is sweet to her. They share a passion for the sky and all the things that exist light years away.

Wanderer, Hippie, Peaceful, Relaxed<br>
An intergalactic wanderer who travels the stars from place to place. She's peaceful and doesn't much like violence.   Often will "hitchhike" from Virtupets Space Station.<br><b>Art credit to hzoo_26</b>

glamorous | meticulous | mischievious | selfish<br>
Sweet as candy, and just as much trouble. Kass is loved dearly by her entire family, and is zealously protected. Which sometimes backlashes when she and NAME go out adventuring by themselves. She is having a hard time picking out a petpet to play with, they all keep running away screaming when she tries to play babies with them.

<div class="box"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/ymPiq2l.png" width="150" style="padding-right: 5px; float: left;"><h5>Locke - The Reformed Law Woman</h5>
Confident, Strong, Independent, Fashionable<br>
The confident "dock mistress" of Krawk Island, she knows all of the regular ships like the back of her hand. A former bootlegger and smuggler, she now works for the Guv'ner to help keep smugglers at bay.  <br><b>Art credit to hzoo_26</b>

<img src="http://openneo-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/outfits/001/223/888/small_preview.png" style="padding-right: 5px; float: left;"><h5>Ris - The Angry Rocker</h5>
belligerent | hypocritical | moody | spiteful<br>
OWNER says I'm a hot head, I didn't think it was very funny, since I am painted fire. Until OWNER apologizes she's getting the silent treatment; unless I happen to feel like dressing her down. The last time someone made me that mad I yelled a tirade at them so powerful and long that I lost my voice for a week. But it was so worth it. I didn't have to deal with their face for months. Concerts make me happy. Nonetheless; Nero keeps hoping that Neopia will find out what therapists are soon, so I can be placed into Anger Management Therapy... </div>

Helpful, Kind, Enthusiastic, Peppy<br>
Lab assistant to a mad neopian scientist, she travels around neopia searching for machine parts and ingredients for experiments.<br>
She isn't your typical Lutari, she has an accent not from Neopia, and it makes her stick out. She is always polite, but is brutally honest when it is called for. She loves to sing Highland melodies her ancestors sang generations ago.

Bubbly | Fearless | Sassy | Vain<br>
She is considered a daredevil with a sense of humor.  Her pet pink ona is her stunt partner, and videos their antics. One of the most important things Jea insists on is triple checking all their gear before each and every outing; be it repelling down cliffhanger mountain, or exploring Moltaran tunnels.

Tortured, Regretful, Kind, Blind<br> Paying penance for mistakes earlier in life, this matron of a Haunted Woods orphanage/foster home may be blind, but she manages to take very good care of the wayward souls that come under her care. <br>
Incredibly and awkwardly shy. Insists on full blown manners and proper bearing at all times.

calculating | malicious | obsessive | resentful<br>
Let me tell you a little story. Once upon a time I was a normal Neopet. But that was long long ago. I am now a monster, neither machine nor Neopet. You've probably heard of the the Bionic Cybunny from NeoQuest, I am that experiment done first, and taken two steps further.
Despicable is what all normal things are to me now. They neither move nor think the same capacity as I. OWNER opened her home to me, but it is nothing more than my base of operations. I am completely incapable of having a home, or feeling emotions.

arrogant | cynical | eccentric | tempermental<br>
I am the most intelligent and the strongest of all of Neopets. Therefore; I must be best one. But again; I am everyone's favorite. I have been inducted into the Freedome Fighter force; but keep that to yourself *wink* it's very highly classified. As highly decorated as I am, my petpet and my owner are my only companions. No one else has proven trustworty enough for me to bestow my affections upon them. Although I regularly train in the battledome and at the Mystery Island School, I only fight Defenders of Neopia villians. Fellow Neopets are not a threat.

conceited | grim | noxious | twisted<br>
Many, many years ago, there was an innocent young plushie poogle, who was kidnapped, locked in a dark dungeon, and tortured. Before he could be rescued, the laboratory ray misfired and locked him in time stasis.
His loving family couldn't find a way to restore him, other than the passage of time, so they secured a cave on the deserted slopes of Terror Mountain's smaller and scarier cousin, Dread Mountain.
Time passed, as it does, and eventually he was released from the stasis. However, he was trapped in the cave, with only a strange, fluffy, pink petpet as company... The meepit fed Fozeu many lies and evil thoughts through their imprisonment. And when the cave entrance finally crumbled with the discovery of Tyrannia, they were unleashed unto the unsuspecting world...

Well helloo Neopia...
I have a score to settle with you...

compliant | neurotic | squeamish | timid<br>
Confined to his under-sea cave, Gray grew up very isolated and disconnected. His first exposure to the world outside only occurred due to the panicked yelling that woke him from a deep sleep. The owner of the voice that brought Gray thrashing out of his cave belonged to Blue, who was caught in a fishing net. Although terrified beyond belief, Gray valiantly shredded the net to rescue the blue Quadrapus from his would-be capturers. Since then you will never see Blue far from Gray, not for need of his protection, but the other way around. He cheers his Jetsam enthusiastically hoping one day Gray will overcome his panic attacks, and grow out of his childish fears. So far, Graeyh is still afraid of just about EVERYTHING.

affectionate | charming | optimistic | scatterbrained<br>
A confused mixologist plies his bestie temi with his made-up concoctions... Jha keeps track of everything he eats on his petpage, since he is trying to get on the gourmet club list. He has a long way to go, but you can keep checking back to see his progress. Jha has been know to play the trickster, and switch around drinks at the dinner table...  Beware; this coconut loves to greet everyone with a hug... Which he somehow manages to do without having any arms...

 flighty | fashionista | narcissistic | loyal<br>
Having spent all day running around Neopia, visiting Mystical Surroundings, NC Mall, Swarthy and Prigpants, and the Thrift Shoppe; he still hadn't finished his shopping. On the floor in the middle of the accessory aisle at Uni's Clothing, Kay sat looking for the perfect touch to his sibling's look. A barrette? No. A Mask? xD No. Aaah, here we go, this is gonna be smashing.<br>
Walking towards the checkout, Tacky sees PETPET and OWNER dozing along the wall, waiting for him...

This Lutari is very kind, but not outgoing in the least. He can usually be found scribbling in one of his abundant notebooks and chattering to himself. When speaking with others he waits until he is directly spoken to, and snarkily answers as concisely as possible. Once you earn this guy's trust he is loyal to a fault. although you break his trust, good luck being forgiven. his shortness drives his friend PETPET absolutely bonkers; although her habit of fidgeting does the same for Lu.

garrulous | riotous | savvy | vulnerable<br>
He is very expressive, and has a eccentric sense of humor. He like to put on impromptu shows for the whole family, which don't always go as planned.... (don't ever mention bananas to him!)<br>
He is currently enrolled in the School of Mimes that will help him fulfill his lifelong dream of being a professional mimes in the courts of royalty and the Uber-Faeries. His workload seems to be very heavy, but most of his family just really doesn't understand it, although they try to be supportive. His days consist of class in the mornings, and then the afternoons hanging around the Marketplace practicings and perfecting his sk<i></i>ills.<br>
Story: <textarea name="">
On the first day of mime training all the classes were late. All the instructors were closeted up arguing over one pet; petpet that is. Jee Gabar wanted and deserved admittance to the school; but it was unprecedented to allow a petpet the honor of becoming a professional mime; especially as he didn't have a Neopet sponsor. Mym listened to all the chatter and then he shouldered his way to the front of the crowd. Jee sat there impassively awaiting the judgment on his future. Suddenly the doors opened to reveal the dean of the school along with all the instructors. As the Dean looked down at Jee he drew himself to he full height, which reached all the way to the kneecaps of the Dean. The Dean then started to explain that the only way Jee could be enrolled as a student was if a current student would sponsor him. The crowd went silent. Jee's shoulders fell. No one moved, and you could have heard even the stealthy Pant Devil move. Jee started to drag himself away from the door when Mym cried "Wait! I will sponsor you." Jee's eyes gleamed with unshed tears as together they entered the School of Mimes.

aggressive | defiant | jealous | stingy<br>
The Tonu that wears the helmet, known as the Juggernaut, possesses Class 100 strength, enabling him to lift (press) over 100 tons. The Juggernaut is said to be unstoppable, and the upper limit to his strength is not known.<br>
The Juggernaut possesses untold power, mystical in nature, which enhances his strength to an as yet unknown degree and makes him a seemingly irresistible, unstoppable being. Once he begins to walk in a certain direction, no obstacle or known force has been observed to be able to stop him. <br>
The Juggernaut can survive indefinitely without food, water, or oxygen. He is sustained by his mystical energies alone.

boring | egocentric | ignorant | pretentious<br>
Trai has the amazing ability to talk the ears off of any creature close enough for him to notice. But somehow, among all of his chatter, he never really says anything... If the listener tries to interject a comment, an excuse to leave, or any other sound, he will talk right over the top of them so he can finish his "interesting" monologue. (Luckily PETPET is incapable of hearing the vocalization range that Trai speaks in.)

Good Characterization is why most people read fiction. Sure, you can draw your readers in with action, mystery, and romance, but years from now, your readers will remember your characters the most.
