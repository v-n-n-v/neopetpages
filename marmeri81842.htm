<h2> <b><font size="5">Introduction</font></b> </h2>
So, you're minding your own business, trying to gather keys, when you find some fancy pair of boots lying on the path. "What do they do?", you wonder innocently. That I can answer for you in the following guide, as well as provide a bit of insight on the rest of the fun toys the Key Quest offers. 
<br><br><b>Note:</b> I've categorized the powerups by how useful they are. 
<br><br><b><font color="blue">Blue descriptions:</font></b> Very useful
<br><b><font color="green">Green descriptions:</font></b> Somewhat useful
<br><b><font color="purple">Purple descriptions:</font></b> Not very useful
<br><br><h2> <i>General Tips and Tricks</i> </h2>
There are a few tips I can give that will apply to most powerups and how they're used: 

<ul><li>
<b>Make sure you know exactly what each powerup will do.</b>
<br>
This seems like it's a given, but you'd be surprised how easy it is to forget the intricacies of certain powerups in a heated match of KQ.

</li>
<li>
<b>Try saving powerups for later.</b>
<br>
Hang on to a Rainbow Fountain Water or a Misdirected Compass if you can, just in case something unexpected happens. That way, you've got a safeguard in case your opponent suddenly makes a break for the door with all his keys.

</li>
<li>
<b>Know which way your opponent is going.</b>
<br>
Several powerups are dependent upon which way either you or your opponent is going, (Transporter Helmet, Mortog, and Misdirected Compass, to name a few). Don't get confused and waste your powerup on a silly move.

</li>
<li>
<b>Go with your gut.</b>
<br>
If your instinct is screaming that you should play that Giant Lint Ball/Misdirected Compass/etc., do it. At worst, you lose a lint ball. At best, you've stopped your opponent from getting two keys in one turn. 

</li>
</ul><h2> <i><font color="purple">Battle Dice</font></i> </h2>
A powerup where the name says it all, the Battle Dice starts a duel, (also known as a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors :P),  between yourself and one other player. The winner gets to choose a powerup out of three possible choices, much like you do when you win a Mini-Game. This is not a good powerup to play when you're ahead, because if you lose the duel, your opponent might get a powerup that can cost you the whole game. I've seen this happen many times, (usually because they got a Distraction Potion).
<br><br>

I usually don't play this unless I'm behind by at least three keys and my opponent is heading for the door. 
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="green">Boots of Flight</font></i> </h2>
This powerup looks like a pair of footprints on your player -blocked- Use it, and you will get to roll two dice instead of just one. This is useful if you need to get to a key before your opponent does, as it often allows you to move 7+ spaces in one turn, unless you're me. Then you get no more than a 4. x_x 
<br><br><b>Special Note:</b> There's an event that can occur when someone lands on a blue and orange star space, (unofficially called the King Roo Event), that allows you to roll a 12-sided die instead of a 6-sided one. If you use your Boots of Flight then, you get to roll two 12-sided dice, thus you can move up to 24 spaces in one turn! 
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="green">Distraction Potion</font></i> </h2>
Similar to the Rainbow Fountain Water, This allows you to swap one key with your opponent. The only problem with this is that if your opponent doesn't have a key you need, or if you don't have doubles of a particular key color, then the usefulness of the Distraction Potion is somewhat limited. Although, if you have keys to spare, why not mess around with the other guy's keys? 
<br><br>

...Or you can be sneaky, and give your opponent a key color that they already have, then snag it with a Spare Keyring on your next turn. ;)
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="blue">Giant Lint Ball</font></i> </h2>
Giant Lint Ball, oh, the controversy you have sparked, (more on that later)! This evil powerup prevents one player of your choosing from collecting keys or powerups for one whole turn! It seems like eternity when it's used on you! This also entails getting keys from other powerups, (RFW, Distraction Potion, Key Grabber, etc.), as well as preventing you from winning keys or powerups from mini-games.
<br><br><b>Note:</b> There is a glitch involving this powerup and the Bottled Quicksand. If a player is hit with both a Bottled Quicksand and a Giant Lint Ball in the same turn, it will prevent that person from collecting any items for the entire game! 
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="blue">Loaded Gummy Die</font></i> </h2>
This is one of my favorite powerups, as it lets you pick your next roll, i.e. the roll you get immediately after you use it. Use it, then pick your roll, anything from 1 to 6. I often do this to land on the treasure chest, thus picking up an extra key, powerup, and NP cache. Or, use it to land on your alignment square, and pick up a super powerup and a spiffy charm to help you out!
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="green">Mortog</font></i> </h2>
Mortogs can be a game breaker. They let you jump to the space where your opponent is, then move one space ahead of them. Very useful if your opponent is in front of the goal, and you happen to have all the keys you need, thus netting you an easy win. Be warned- you cannot use the Mortog to jump onto the door space, (the space with the green arrow). If you do, the game will not allow you to move anymore, no matter how many times you roll the die. This is a glitch that TNT forgot to fix when they designed 
the game, and there is no sign that they will fix it anytime soon, so don't do it!
<br><br><b>Update:</b> Contrary to my previous statement, TNT has fixed this glitch. You can now use the Mortog to win the game. 
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="blue">Misdirected Compass</font></i> </h2>
This is another of those genuinely useful tools you have at your disposal. It reverses the direction you or your opponent is going. I use it on myself to turn around after getting a particularly out-of-the-way key, so I don't have to take the long way around. Or try using it on yourself after getting hit with the Something Has Happened event that reverses everyone's direction. You'll be good to go while everyone else struggles to turn themselves around. ;)
Under the effects of a Lint Ball? Not a problem. Go ahead and pass the key, then play the compass on yourself to turn around and snag the key on the way back. In addition to helping you out, it makes it look like you're a Key Quest pro. ;) 
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="blue">Pocket Portal</font></i> </h2>
This is an incredibly useful powerup that lets you warp to any portal on the map. It's even more useful on the new Chocolate Board, with its 6 different portals. It doesn't work if the portals are jammed, though. Oh well...
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="blue">Rainbow Fountain Water</font></i> </h2>
Put simply, I LOVE the Rainbow Fountain Water. It changes the color of one person's key to another of your choice. Since it works on both your opponent and yourself, I use it to either prevent my opponents from having all five key colors, or I use it on myself to get that one key I need, (hmmmm... It seems I have two green keys, but no yellow... I can fix that! Rainbow Fountain Water to the rescue!). 
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="blue">Rainbow Sticky Hand</font></i> </h2>
All's fair in love, war, the last Christmas cookie, and Key Quest. This sneaky powerup lets you steal a powerup from one person. I use it to steal Loaded Gummy Dice or Rainbow Fountain Waters, since I like those the most. But, if you really want to be sneaky, try using your RSH to steal your opponent's RSH. It allows you to play powerups with impunity without fear of having them stolen. Or you can hang on to it and wait for your opponent to get a Super Powerup and snag it from them. =D
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="purple">Spare Keyring</font></i> </h2>
The Spare Keyring is probably one of the least useful powerups that Key Quest has to offer. It steals all duplicate keys that one opponent holds. But, it steals keys from your foes! It has to be helpful! And it is, but rarely do my adversaries have more than one key of any particular color. If you're playing a game going for a certain number of key sets, then yes, the Spare Keyring does have its advantages, but they are limited in standard game play.
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="purple">Tornado Ring</font></i> </h2>
The Tornado Ring is what you play if you're feeling lucky. Use it on yourself or your opponent to replace all that person's powerups with random ones. It can be useful if you need to get rid of something your opponent has, but I find that it most often gives out better powerups than it removes. The only reason I play the Tornado Ring is to eliminate a Super Powerup that my opponent's gotten. Since you can only get Super Powerups from alignment squares, they'll never get a replacement. 
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="green">Transporter Helmet</font></i> </h2>
A similar powerup to the Mortog, although instead of jumping to where your opponent is, you both switch places. This makes the TH usable for both offensive and defensive functions. You can use it to get closer to the door, or to keep your opponent away from the door, by going to some out-of-the-way location, (I find the Lonely Highway to be suitable most times), thus forcing them to make a long detour, while you collect the few keys you're missing. Be aware, though, that the Transporter Helmet does not change your direction. You will go the same direction your opponent was going when you played the Helmet.
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="green">Virtudice</font></i> </h2>
Ah, nothing like sprinkling in a little bit of mad science into a board game. The Virtudice lets you automatically move six spaces, no matter what you roll that turn. A nice powerup to play when you have nothing else you need to do that turn, except to roll the die.
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="blue">Bottled Quicksand (Not used in 2-player games</font></i> </h2>
A powerup only found in 3- and 4-player games, Bottled Quicksand forces one opponent to skip their next turn. This can be the most cruel and unusual punishment to someone who has all the keys, and is about three spaces away from victory. I use it whenever an opportunity arises, mainly to prevent it from being stolen and used on me!
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="green">Catapult (Not used in 2-player games)</font></i> </h2>
The catapult is a very simple powerup that is derived from the ancient trebauchets that hurled heavy rocks over castle walls back in the day, (ahhhh, memories). In Key Quest, however, the Catapult lets you send one person, (including yourself), back to their start space. I use it to send myself back to the Neopia Central house once I have all the keys I need. From there, it's about 12 spaces to an easy win!
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="green">Giant Rock Mote (Not used in 2-player games)</font></i> </h2>
The Giant Rock Mote is one of those powerups where you hope and pray that it doesn't get used on you, ever. When used, it rolls around the board for 15 spaces in the direction the you are going, and any player it hits will have their next turn skipped. If used properly, it can buy an entirely free turn for the user! However, you cannot choose which way the Mote will go at intersections, so keep that in mind. Also, make sure you aren't facing the door. If you use the GRM in front of the door, it will go bye-byes. We don't want that. ;)
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="blue">Key Grabber (Not used in 2-player games) </font></i> </h2>
The Key Grabber lets you steal a key from one opponent. I think it's pretty cut and dry. Another one of those uber-useful tools, the Key Grabber can make or break a tight game between 4 people. They are also the favored target of Rainbow Sticky Hands, so be prepared to defend your grabbers from prying eyes.
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="green">Pile of Dung (Not used in 2-player games)</font></i> </h2>
Similar to, but weaker than, the Super Pile of Dung described later, the Pile of Dung blocks one space on the board, preventing any player from passing through it. Any player that tries to pass through the blocked space will stop moving, and their remaining spaces they were going to move will be negated. This is most often used to block either the treasure chest space or the door, and it can be infuriating if you put it right in front of your opponent so he can't move. 
<br><br>
However, the Pile of Dung is best used at a junction. Place the dung so your opponent can't go down one of the paths, but can still move in the direction they're going. Thus they will be forced to take a long detour or miss out on picking up a key they need. 
<br><br><b>Special Note: </b>There has been a bit of indiscretion over whether playing this to stop yourself from missing a key is cheating. I can say with impunity that it is not cheating to block yourself with either the regular Pile of Dung or the Super Pile of Dung to avoid missing a key. So there. :P
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="purple">Pocket Mini-Game (Not used in 2-player games)</font></i> </h2>
As the name says, the Pocket Mini-Game allows you to trigger a randomly chosen mini-game, which everyone must play. Personally, I don't like to play the Mini-Games, and most players' computers cannot handle them, so I usually wind up discarding this. However, if you are Da Bomb at Mini-Games, then this can be an excellent way to get that last pesky key.
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="blue">Swap Keyrings (Not used in 2-player games)</font></i> </h2>
This potent powerup allows you to swap ALL of your keys with ALL of one of your opponent's keys. If used correctly, this can turn a game completely around, giving the last place player the game at the very end. Because it is so powerful, it is also very rare. I've only seen it used twice. 
<br><br><h2> <b><font size="5">Charms, Hexes, and Super Powerups</font></b> </h2>
Some of these powerups, (the Super Boots of Flight, Super Catapalt, Super Key Grabber, and Giant Pile of Dung that will be described later), can only be acquired by landing on the alignment square that matches the token you are currently using. For example, the Yellow Poogle Starter Token is water aligned, and the Red Meerca is air aligned. You can check the alignment of your tokens by finding them in your collector's case. When you land on your corresponding square, you will receive a powerup chosen at random from these next four "Super Powerups", and you will also get a Charm that protects 
or buffs you, usually for two of your turns. 
<br><br><h2> <b>Charms</b> </h2>
These charms are quite varied in their effects, and they usually can be quite effective in thwarting your opponents' attempts to sabotage your Key Questing. In addition, you can choose to refuse a charm if you want to. Since some of them can prevent you from playing powerups on yourself, don't forget that you can do so, should the situation arise.
<br><br><h2> <i>A Visit From the Air Faerie</i> </h2>
One of the more straightforward charms, the Air Faerie will pop up and move you ahead 3 extra spaces. You can still pick up keys and powerups while you're taking your extra move, so don't refuse because you're afraid you'll miss out on a key.
<br><br><h2> <i>A Visitor From Space</i> </h2>
A useful charm if you're missing a single key, a helpful Aisha-manned space ship will appear out of nowhere and beam you over to any key on the board, which you will then collect. Just be sure you can get to the door relatively quickly after collecting your last key, as most people tend to play Rainbow Fountain Waters and Misdirected Compasses on those who have all five keys.
<br><br><h2> <i>Keep Those Feet Planted</i> </h2>
This is a somewhat useful charm that protects you from all effects that change your position or direction. This means that Misdirected Compasses, Catapults, Super Catapults, Mortogs, and Transporter Helmets will have no effect on you, nor will the King Skarl or Reverse Direction SHH Events. So be sure you won't need to play any of those powerups on yourself for two turns.
<br><br><h2> <i>An Unlikely Hero</i> </h2>
This is one charm that I'm not sure what it does. Armin the Mighty will appear in front of you and protect your keys for two turns. Theoretically, this would protect you from effects such as Rainbow Fountain Waters and Distraction Potions, but for some reason, it doesn't. The only things I've found that it protects you from are Key Grabbers and Super Key Grabbers.
<br><br><b>Update:</b> This has apparently been changed. This charm will block Rainbow Fountain Waters and Distraction Potions, even if you're going to play them on yourself. Be aware of that. ;)
<br><br><h2> <i>The Light Faerie's Blessing</i> </h2> 
This charm can be a bit confusing as to its effects when activated. It prevents any negative effects from hexes, (the bad things that occur when you land on any alignment space other than your own). Thus, its usefulness is somewhat limited. I liked it more before TNT changed it.
<br><br>
It used to be that this protected you from any negative powerup, but I guess that TNT felt that this was too much of a bonus. Shame, really.  
<br><br><h2> <i>Everyone Deserves a Second Chance...</i> </h2> 
Similar to the A Visit from the Air Faerie charm, Judge Hog will show up and allow you to roll again. Apparently whatever he says goes... However, unlike the Air Faerie charm, you can move anywhere from 1 to 6 spaces, instead of a flat 3.
<br><br><h2> <b>Hexes</b> </h2> 
However, If you land on any other alignment square besides the one you're aligned with, you will be hit with a hex. These will hamper your Key Questing almost as effectively as the charms help with it. 
<br><br><h2> <i>Beware the Swamp Witch</i> </h2> 
This is a positively infuriating hex that sends you back to start, courtesy of Sophie the Swamp Witch. She always seems to visit when I'm on my way to the door with all 5 keys, so be aware of that if you're debating taking a hex to save a couple spaces on your way to victory. 
<br><br><h2> <i>Whirlpools Aren't As Fun As They Sound</i> </h2>
Another one of those infuriating hexes. Get this, and The Drenched will surround you and spin you around, forcing you to go the opposite direction. This can be negated with the help of a Misdirected Compass played on yourself, but it can't be prevented with the help of the Keep Those Feet Planted charm for some reason.
<br><br><h2> <i>Friend or Foe?</i> </h2>
This is a hex that can actually wind up helping you instead of hurting you. Get this, and all of the powerups you have will be replaced with other powerups at random. It's exactly like having a Tornado Ring played on you. However, this seems to be one of the rarer hexes, and it usually doesn't come into play. 
<br><br><h2> <i>You Don't Have Enough Pockets</i> </h2> 
Another hex that takes its effects from a powerup, (The Giant Lint Ball, to be exact), the Pant Devil will follow you around for one turn, thus preventing you from picking up any powerups, keys, or NPs. This includes anything you would get from duels, mini-games, or Something has Happened events. 
<br><br><h2> <i>Don't Play With Fire</i> </h2> 
Because it's no fun if there aren't some pyrotechnics involved in Key Quest, this hex calls Eithne over, who promptly incinerates one of your powerups, chosen at random. Although, she always seems to be drawn towards Rainbow Sticky Hands and Battle Dice for some reason. Don't ask me why. 
<br><br><h2> <i>Slow and Steady Does Not Win the Race</i> </h2> 
This is a hex that's not particularly bad in most cases. Hubrid Nox shows up and limits your next roll to a 1, 2, or 3 with his magic voodoo. This isn't a problem if you happen to have a Virtudice on hand. ;) 
<br><br><h2> <b><font size="5">And now, without any further blathering on my part, the Super Powerups!</font></b> </h2> 
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="blue">Super Boots of Flight</font></i> </h2> 
The Super Boots of Flight is one of those powerups that is just fun to use. When played, it allows you to roll three dice in one turn, thus you can move up to 18 spaces at once! <br><br><b>Special Note:</b> As with the regular Boots of Flight, you can use this powerup to roll multiple 12-sided dice under the effects of the King Roo Event. In this case, you can move up to 36 spaces at once!
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="purple">Super Catapult</font></i> </h2>
Are you noticing a pattern with these "super" powerups? The Super Catapult lets you send two players back to start. Since this is available in two-player games, you may think that you'll be forced to send yourself back to start. Now now, don't fret your little head. You can use the SC to send your opponent back, then click on the little x in the bottom right corner of the box that shows available targets, to prevent yourself from getting sent back.
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="blue">Super Key Grabber</font></i> </h2> 
A powerup name TNT spent all night thinking up, the Super Key Grabber let you steal two keys from one opponent. Nasty! (and it's 33% more grabby!) Personally, I don't feel that the Super Key Grabber is a fair powerup in two-player games, (it's really hard to come back from having two keys taken at once), so I'll get rid of mine as soon as I get one, if possible. But, to each his own. 
<br><br><h2> <i><font color="green">Super Pile of Dung</font></i> </h2> 
What a strange powerup. The Giant Pile of Dung blocks two spaces on the board, preventing anyone, (including you), from passing over those spaces. Use it to block the finish gate for a turn, forcing your opponent to make another lap of the board, and giving you more time to make your move.
<br><br>

As with the regular Pile of Dung, this is best used to force your opponent down a path they don't want to take. 
<br><br><b>Special Note: </b>There has been a bit of indiscretion over whether playing this to stop yourself from missing a key is cheating. I can say with impunity that it is not cheating to block yourself with either the regular Pile of Dung or the Super Pile of Dung to avoid missing a key. So there. :P
<br><br><h2> <font size="5"><b>The Lint Ball Controversy</b></font> </h2>
Some unsavory types have figured out how to beat the system in the way of powerups. When these people, (we won't say any names), have a powerup, such as a Giant Lint Ball, played on them, and they can't afford to feel the effects, they'll wait for the timer counting down their turn to run out. When this timer runs out, their turn is skipped, thereby eliminating the effects of the powerup that was played on them, (all powerups last for for 1 turn only).  
<br><br>

This practice has been dubbed cheating by TNT, Snarkie stated it on the KQ boards, and there has been an editorial written about this, (check issue 371), and thus, it is not allowed, meaning that anyone who does this is subject to suspension or freezing. Is winning a game of Key Quest 
really worth your whole account that you've put 70+ months into? I didn't think so. If you lose a game, cash in your silver key, and go play another one. Simple as that. 
<br><br><br>
