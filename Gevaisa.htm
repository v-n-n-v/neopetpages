<h2>Who and What We Are:

The Prehistoric NEOHOME Board is an ongoing neohome-oriented chat thread that has been floating around the Spotlights and Galleries board since November of 2003, when it was begun by Icesurfingpenguin, Netjeru, Rayneoterra and Ady914.  Since the opening of the new Neohome Board, we've moved over there.  We're here to discuss our neohomes; topics include everything from  brainstorming ideas to getting help or feedback and showing off our newest creations.  Sometimes it's just nice to have company while we neohome or people to complain with ("Have you SEEN the cost of Zen Drawers lately!?").  
</h2><p>
In the words of the OLDPD:  "This is not a guild."  You don't need an invitation to join in.  While there is a large crowd of regulars and an enormous number of occasionals, newbies are welcome to stop in at any time and it's perfectly alright to lurk if you want.
</p><p>
Don't be afraid that your home isn't "good enough" either - we have people here with homes at all different stages of completeness, and even the old fogies fondly remember being neohoming newbies.  (They had to tile uphill.  Both ways.  In the snow.)  If you're just dropping in so you can hear us tell you how great your home is, be advised that we see a lot of neohomes, and although yours might be the best you've ever seen, it's probably not the best we've ever seen.  It's gotten pretty hard to knock our socks off.  Most people will get something along the lines of: "it's a good start" - which isn't meant to be a negative comment at all.  It just means that we're still wearing our socks.  
</p><p>
There is always ONE active thread at a time... and unless something goes completely haywire, we do not abandon a thread until page 20.  We try to stick to the same format in our thread titles as well: "PNT:" in the beginning,"NEOHOME" in allcaps in the middle, and smilies on either end.  That's how we know where to find us ;)
</p><p>
A final note:  The thread and the board in general can both be slow-paced.  Even if it looks like no one's there, there's probably someone lurking who can answer any questions you have... it just might be a while before you get a reply, since we tend to multitask.
<a name="faqs"><h2>FAQs:</h2>

Q.  How do I get my furniture at an angle?<br>
A.  Click on the item and then hold down the shift key while you click the button to rotate the item.
<p>
Q.  How do people get furniture to go up the walls like that?  Mine keeps jumping back.<br>
A.  Furniture won't go up the wall if it's rotated at 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, or -90 degrees.  Any non-90 degree angle will work, though, as will -180 degrees.
</p><p>
Q.  How do I name rooms in my neohome?<br>
A.  To name the rooms, go to your neohome.  Click the add/remove rooms or gardens link.  Then click on the room you want to name.  A popup window will appear where you can change the name of your room.  Unfortunately you can't use apostrophes.
</p><p>
Q.  What do extensions do?<br>
A.  The short answer is "nothing."  They only appear on your ULU and don't affect anything in your neohome except the cost of rooms.  For more information on them, see <a href="//www.neopets.com/~neohome_guide#extensions"> here</a>.

</p><p>
Q.  Where can I see what the different land or room types look like?<br>
A.  <a href="//www.neopets.com/~neohome_guide#land"> Here's the land</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/~neohome_guide#rooms">here are rooms</a>.
</p><p>
Q.  Where can I see what X item looks like in a neohome/garden?<br>
A. You can see most <a href="//www.neopets.com/~britney1617">furniture items here</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/~sweety3191dd"> garden items here</a>.  Another way to view the items is through <a href="//www.neopets.com/~bibliaphila"> this page</a>.

</p><p>
Q.  Is it possible for me to listen to the speakers before I buy them?<br>
A.  Yep.  Just go <a href="//www.neopets.com/~bibliaphila#speakers">here</a> for links to the various speakers in rooms.</p><p>
Q.  What is X new item called?  Have you seen any of them yet?<br>
A.  Generally items are released a few days to a few months after they are announced.  Very rarely are they immediately released.  <a href="//www.neopets.com/~whats_new">Check here</a> to see if they have been released yet and <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Ayanbadejo">here</a> to see them in Secret's home.

</p><p>
Q.  What can I use to resemble water?<br>
A.  People usually can either build an icy or transparashield room or use icy or bubble furniture.  In gardens, people have used lots of ponds, glass roses and snow angels. 
</p><p>
Q.  What's this pwn/pen stuff and why are there strange trophies handed out at the beginning of each thread?<br>
A.  That's an old habit, really.  "Pwn" is a deliberate mis-spelling of "own" and the first person who posts on a thread "owns" it (in a video-gamer-esque meaning of the word).  There's a friendly competition to be the first to post on a new thread.  (It's similar to the friendly competition to avoid making the new thread, really.)  Note - pwning should only be attempted for the first post, not for each subsequent page.  "Pen" - that's a deliberate mis-typing of "pwn."   It's people making fun of Brennehilda, who infamously "penned" a thread once.  We haven't let her live it down yet and don't really have any intention of it in the foreseeable future.</p><p>
Q.  Who has that ship neohome?  I can't remember her name.<br>
A.  That'd be <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=kimvanwilligenburg">kimvanwilligenburg</a> ;)

<a name="customs"><h2>Board Customs:</h2>

We know we're not TNT and therefore we ultimately have no authority to make you behave a certain way, but we are a long-standing community that has evolved certain customs in response to issues we've faced in the past.  These customs also help make us the kind of place where people like coming.  So, to make things easier, we'll just say that we'd appreciate it if you follow them on the board.<p>

<b>Things we'd appreciate you did do:</b>
</p><p>
- Read Neopets rules and follow them.</p><p>
- Be helpful to other people.  They're here to get help, too, so spread it around.</p><p>
- Say hi to new people when they appear.  We were all newbies once.</p><p>
- Be aware that people who come to the board are from many different backgrounds and countries and appreciate that English might not be their first (or second) language.</p><p>

<b>Things we'd appreciate you didn't do:</b>

</p><p>
- Ask us to rate your neohome.  Here's why this is a problem:  Number ratings don't mean anything.  What's a 3?  What's an 8?  Also, rating a whole home takes a lot of time and effort.  Instead, try asking for feedback on a room or two.
</p><p>
- Post links to your neohome rooms or gardens.  While they are the fastest way to get to your room for reference, they are long links and stretch the board.  This makes it very hard for people to read back-posts (as some of us do), especially for those people who have lower screen resolutions.  Instead, try posting the coordinates for the page.  You can find a guide <a href="//www.neopets.com/~neohome_guide#rooms">here</a>.  If that's seriously too difficult for you or you don't have a link to your neohome in your ULU (something you should consider fixing), you can post a link to your neohome overall - since it's a shorter link and won't stretch the board as badly.  It'll look something like this: //www.neopets.com/neohome.phtml?owner=username 
</p><p>
- Copy the rooms of other neohomers in whole or in part without permission.  While it's generally fine to put your own twist on someone else's creation, most people generally do prefer if you ask them first.  
</p><p>
- Bump or spam: the Spotlights and Galleries chat goes VERY slowly and we're used to that pace over here, but you might not be.  Basically, it can take over a day for a topic to fall to the second page of the board, and no one wants to read a page of "bump" or you posting messages to yourself.
</p><p>
- Get horribly and off-puttingly off-topic.  It's human nature to wander off-topic from time to time, and it helps us to get to know each other better... but you've also got to be aware that off-topic discussions can hijack the entire thread or scare people off.
</p><p>
- Fight.  If you've got a problem with someone else on the thread, play nicely while you're here and take it to neomail.  If you absolutely cannot converse with the person, then avoid them or ignore them completely.  
</p><p>
- Appear solely for the purpose of advertising your shop, trades or auctions.  TNT has made boards for those, and we know where they are.  Most of us feel that there are exceptions to this rule, however, if you are giving a "neohomer's discount" equivalent to a reseller offer (because we don't mind a deal now and then) or have an item that only shows up once every few months.  Asking us for a price check is also fine... although we might not know offhand.
</p><p> 

- Advertise or recruit for your guild. We don't need the squabbling and TNT helpfully made a board for that.
</p><p>
Finally:
Welcome to the PNT thread.  Sorry this page was so very long!
