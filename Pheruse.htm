<b>The Basics</b></p>
<p>
Pets which are "stuck" in the pound will not show up when pound surfing. The vast majority of these pets will be basic and likely poorly named. There are a number of ways to find these stuck pets, I'll be sharing just one of the many methods out there. This will show you how to identify key phrases to search for via petpage and what to do with it.</p>
<p>
The most important thing when finding stuck pets is <b>patience</b>. No matter what method you use there will be a large number of bad links. The pets may already have owners, be basic or have a bad name. Sometimes they may even be a completely different species than you searched for. There is no short cut to get to the good pets. You will always have bad links when you search.</p>
<p>
If you're new to searching for stuck pets, I suggest you start with the petpage method. It's how I started and how I still search periodically.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p><h1>Searching Via Petpage</h1>
<p>
As I said before, if you're new to finding stuck pets I suggest searching via petpage. There are plenty of guides out there which will give you the exact phrase for each species to search for. I won't do that. I will tell you how to find that phrase for yourself.</p><p><img src="http://i603.photobucket.com/albums/tt120/grinkbunny/petpage.jpg" class="right">
Every species has a default petpage, but not every species is ideal for searching. I've selected using the Peophin page as my example as it has all the ideal elements for searching:<br>
The <b>Red Square</b> is the pet's "photo". It will show you what color the pet is while looking at the petpage.<br>
The <b>Green Square</b> is the pet name. Ideal pages will have it located near the photo. This lets you see what the pet name is with a quick glance while your vision will likely be focused on the photo.<br>
The <b>Orange/Yellow Squares</b> are where the owner's username will be. If the pet is in the pound the "owner" will be "none" such as in the screenshot. Peophin is a good example because there are multiple locations in the petpage where this shows up.<br></p><p>
These three things are the most important aspects to look for in a petpage. It's always nice when they're located near each other, like they are with the Peophin. However, sometimes they will be spread out. For example, a Lupe petpage requires scrolling in order to view the photo. Unfortunately, not every petpage has all of these items. You can search for skeiths via petpage, but they lack a photo. So you don't know what color skeith you found without further investigation. Other pets, like Poogles, will not have the owner's name on the page. Without the owner's name you will not be able to search for that species via petpage. Now that you know what the important elements are... How are they used?</p><p>
The username, none, is going to be your key word for searches. Your search phrase will somehow include the word "none." The easiest thing to do is select a sentence which already has none in the middle of it. I like Peophin because you get a number of options to choose from. The <b>Purple Underline</b> is an example of a phrase to be searched for. This is the phrase utilized for the rest of this guide.
</p><p>
Now that your phrase is selected it's time to search. When search it's important that you isolate the search to only neopets.com webpages. On my favored search engine this is done by typing in "site:neopets.com". After that you insert the phrase - remember to use quotation marks! The following shows the search that I did.</p>
<img src="http://i603.photobucket.com/albums/tt120/grinkbunny/Search1.jpg"><p>
You'll notice in the above example only one search result returned. This highlights the importance of clicking the link in the red box. After clicking that link...
</p>
<img src="http://i603.photobucket.com/albums/tt120/grinkbunny/Search.jpg"><p>You now have over 10 pages of results just from clicking that one, easily overlooked, button. The difference in results won't always be this extreme - you may have 3 pages initially and then only 6 after clicking. But that's still more results you would have missed! The grey lines through the text on these searches are the pet names. This is helpful if you're specifically looking for a well named pet. </p><p>
The second image also shows both purple and blue links. The purple links have already been visited. This can be helpful if you regularly search for pets. I skip all of the sites I've been to previously in order to speed up my searches. It's one reason I started my stuck pet page - I wanted to keep track of pets I had found so I wouldn't keep visiting the same links over again. It has drastically sped up new searches.</p><p>
Another piece of advice to speed up searches is to hold ctrl when clicking on links. This will open them in a new tab. Once you've a good number of tabs open, you can quickly look at each one, with your eyes focused on the photo's location, and close the ones that you don't want. This goes by very quickly once you get used to it.
</p><p>
<img src="http://i603.photobucket.com/albums/tt120/grinkbunny/broken%20photo.jpg" class="right"><br>
Every once in a while you'll get a pet with a broken image instead of a photo. This happens if that species could not be painted that color before conversion. Neopets never updated the petpage photos to the new artwork, so the automated link for these colors is dead. I find these fun, because it's a mystery what color it is until you look at the pet's look up! It could be something new like stealthy! Or a boring old snow pet.

Speaking of looking up pets... This is a vital step. A petpage's stated owner being "none" is not enough to guarentee a pet is actually in the pound. It is necessary to go to a pet's lookup (or just search for the pet in the pound). There are three potential "owners", that I know of, which will display "none" on a petpage. The first is that the pet is actually in the pound. The second is that a pet is "waiting". This happens when a premium user with 5 pets cancels their subscription. The 5th pet will be "waiting" for a period of time before it will potentially go in the pound. If the user resubscribes, they will get their pet back. The final option is a pet will be "travelling". A travelling pet is in the midst of a transfer and will never go in the pound.

Hopefully, I've given you the tools to start searching for stuck pets on your own! (And not just Peophins.) If you've any questions or comments feel free to neomail me at grinkbunni. I also have a page dedicated to the stuck pets I've found (linked at the top) if you want to take a look. Thank you for reading!
