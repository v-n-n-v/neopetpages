				<p> You know those videos influencers post where they show you everything in their purse? They inspired me to tell you about the items I always try to keep in my inventory: </p>
				<p> <b>* Thanks Card</b> – Because you never know when someone will do something kind for you, and I still believe in the art of the thank you card. </p>
				<p> <b>* All nine Forgotten Shore Map Pieces</b> – I try to always keep up at least one <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/tradingpost.phtml?type=browse&amp;criteria=owner&amp;search_string=spreadkindness">free trade</a> with a full Forgotten Shore Map reserved for newbies so they can easily unlock the daily. </p>
				<p> <b>* Some sort of Omelette</b> – I'm constantly browsing the Trading Post to see if anything interesting pops up, and I find it useful to keep an Omelette on hand so I can have something to offer right away if something cool comes along. As a frequent trade poster myself, I know how annoying it can be when someone offers totally junky items. I always appreciate it when someone offers something usable, no matter how inexpensive it is. </p>
				<p> <b>* About twenty of whatever my daily gift is</b> – Every day, I give away a different item for my <a href="//www.neopets.com/~KindnessChallege">Spread Kindness project</a>.
				</p><p> <b>* Some sort of snowball</b> – Whenever I try to neomail someone and their inbox is full, I send them a snowball to let them know.
				</p><p> <b>* A handful of Healing Potions</b> – Since my account isn't old enough to really take advantage of Food Club yet and I find restocking really boring, the Battledome is the main way I can make Neopoints. I always try to save up Healing Potions so I can knock out a bunch of battles in a row and don't have to wait thirty minutes in between each to visit the Healing Springs.
				</p><p> That's about it! I try to keep my inventory below 50 items at all times because I always forget when I'm over the limit, and then I'll go try and buy something and I get scolded for having too many things. </p>
				<p> What about you? What's in <a href="//www.neopets.com/inventory.phtml">your inventory</a>? </p>

				<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/toy_cny_liondance.gif" class="wrapleft"></p>
				<p> I love browsing Neo-galleries, especially when they have a backstory explaining why the player decided to start collecting something. Today I want to share links to some galleries you can peruse, and also some ideas for galleries I haven't found yet but hope they exist somewhere out there. </p>
				<p> You can pretty much throw a rock in any direction and hit a gallery that collects plushies or potions or whatever. But it's always fun to stumble upon galleries with more off-the-wall themes. For example, I once found a gallery made up entirely of items that move (like bobbleheads and springy toys). Another time, I found a "bad art" gallery where all the items were . . . um . . . Let's just say they were not drawn to match Neopets' typical artistic style. To see what I mean, go to the Neopets search bar and search for "Disturbing Gelatin." </p>
				<p> Unfortunately, I didn't save the links to the moving or bad art galleries. But here are a few other cool galleries you should peek into: </p>
				<p> <b>* <a href="//www.neopets.com/gallery/index.phtml?gu=bobyn1013">Robyn's "Slice of Life" Gallery</a></b> – Basically, Robyn put together a gallery of body parts. So creepy, cool, and creative. </p>
				<p> <b>* <a href="//www.neopets.com/gallery/index.phtml?gu=kitleigh">Kit's "Nowhere Land Infinite Lounge" Gallery</a></b> – Kit's gallery has 12 different sections (each linked under the title "Directory of Rooms") and they're all organized by colour. My favorite rooms are the Orbs, Boxes, and Vessels rooms. I don't even know why… They're just so cool! </p>
				<p> <b>* <a href="//www.neopets.com/gallery/index.phtml?gu=teacuptiger">Taro's "Collection Cabinet" Gallery</a></b> – Taro's gallery has a section dedicated to "food that's sorta food but also not food" which I think is so fun. </p>
				<p> <b>* <a href="//www.neopets.com/gallery/index.phtml?gu=spreadkindness">Jen's Gallery</a></b> – May I be so bold as to recommend you check out my gallery? I'm Asian American and wanted to build a gallery of items that honor my heritage. I even made <a href="//www.neopets.com/~_Be_Kind_">a separate page</a> telling the stories behind some of my gallery items! </p>
				<p> I also have other ideas for galleries that I just can't afford to make because I spend all of my points on my <a href="//www.neopets.com/~KindnessChallege">Spread Kindness project</a>. But I would LOVE for you to take one of these ideas and run with it. If you do, will you please <a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=spreadkindness">let me know</a> so I can add your gallery link to this post?
				</p><p> <b>* No One Asked For This</b> – A gallery full of items that make you think, "But… But why?" For example, "Conical Hot Dog."
				</p><p> <b>* What <i>Is</i> This Even?</b> – A collection of confusing items that you're not even sure what they are. For example, "Animal-style Chips…" What does <i>animal-style</i> even mean?
				</p><p> <b>* Words That Are Fun to Say</b> – An assortment of goods with fun-to-say names. For example, "Blooble and Cheese Plate." Hee hee hee. Blooble. Hee.
				</p><p> <b>* Wow, Um, Okay</b> – Look up "Cannibalistic Pumpkin" and you'll get the idea.
				</p><p> <b>* LOL, That's Punny</b> – A collection of all the items with punny names, like "Grarrlnola Bar."
				</p><p> <b>* Well That's Oddly Specific</b> – A gallery of items that seem to have been made for a very, very specific purpose. For example, the "Kacheek Valentine Hair Dryer." Was that really made just for Kacheeks to get a blowout on February 14?

				<p> <b>Jen's Neo-Book Reviews | A Parody</b> </p>
				<p> When you walk up to the looming walls of Meridell Castle, the gleaming gates at Brightvale Castle, or the secretive door to the Hidden Tower of Faerieland's castle, I know what you're thinking… "I wonder what the toilets here are like?" </p>
				<p> Well, fortunately for you (and all of us, really), <i>105 Castle Toilets</i> was published to answer that very question! This book contains over 200 full-colour pages with photos, facts, and stories about nearly every single toilet within Neopia's castle walls. </p>
				<p> As you flip through <i>105 Castle Toilets</i>, you'll learn the answers to questions no would ever have any reason to ask, including: </p>
				<p> <b>*</b> Does the Faerie Queen's Fyora Toilet have a bidet? </p>
				<p> <b>*</b> Did the late King Coltzan flush his Lost Desert Sand Toilet with the lid open or closed? </p>
				<p> <b>*</b> How does Queen Kyishi's Coconut Toilet drain when it doesn't have any plumbing connections? </p>
				<p> <b>*</b> What proportion of bowl cleaner concentrate to water is needed to make the perfect scrubbing mix for King Hagan's Brick Toilet? </p>
				<p> <b>*</b> Who had to fish Princess Fernypoo's phone out of her Fancy Toilet when she dropped it in last? </p>
				<p> <b>*</b> Why did King Kelpbeard contribute to the decimation of the coral reefs by insisting that Coral Toilets be installed in every castle bathroom? </p>
				<p> This thrilling page-turner puts me on pins and needles waiting for the sequel, <i>105 Castle Sinks</i>, which will include stories like "How Princess Amira Discovered Her Favorite Hand Soap," "That Time King Roo Confused His Sink With A Urinal," and "Seriously, Why Does King Kelpbeard Keep Doing This?" </p>
				<p> 10/10, would recommend. </p>

				<p> <b>Update on my June 1 blog post</b> </p>
				<p> So. Yeah. I'm definitely driving inflation. </p>
				<p> Every day for my <a href="//www.neopets.com/~KindnessChallege">Spread Kindness project</a>, I buy a bunch of a certain item. To keep things affordable and sustainable for myself, I try to choose items that are worth around 2,000 NP each… And every item I've purchased for the past few days has shot up in price. We're talking inflation on a pretty small scale, of course, but it's pretty interesting to me that it's happening! </p>
				<p> So basically, if you want to make a few thousand points, you could go over to my Spread Kindness project page, see what I'm buying next, and then invest in buying up a bunch of that item. (Or, you know, skip the small-scale stuff and go straight to big-time restocking.) </p>




				<h2>june 4, 2023</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_snowball_faerie.gif" class="wrapleft"></p>
				<p> You know what I realized today? </p>
				<p> Every single person I've met on Neopets (since four months ago when I started playing again) is a returning player like me. No one is joining Neopets for the first time. </p>
				<p> I'm jealous of the players who were able to regain access to their old accounts and get all their points and items back. (In case you're wondering how to do that, you have to be able to log into the email attached to your old Neopets account and send TNT a message to prove you own the account. I have no way to access my old email, so it's gone forever. RIP.) </p>
				<p> My childhood Neo account was snow-themed because I looooved snow. (This was before I lived in a place where it snows every winter and I realized how much of a pain it is to shovel and drive through.) All my pets were painted Snow, I had a snow-themed gallery, and I started a snow-themed guild… </p>
				<p> One thing I miss about that guild is the "snowball fights" I used to organize. About once a month, we would all "throw" a snowball at each other with the Give to NeoFriend action. The players who had a ton of points would throw a more expensive snowball at the rest of us, which was very generous and thoughtful. </p>
				<p> These "fights" were a great way to help all the guild members get to know each other and become friends. You would throw a snowball at me, I would send you a Neomail to thank you, and a conversation would start from there. For kids like me who grew up with a bad home life and few "real life" friends, these connections were really sweet and meaningful. </p>
				<p> If I had enough NeoFriends who would want to join a guild I made, I would totally start one again. I'd do things like: </p>
				<p> <b>*</b> Host a quarterly potluck where everyone chooses a favourite food to give to everyone. I think I'd personally start with Red Bean Dumplings… Yumm. </p>
				<p> <b>*</b> Organize a nonsense awards show where we give out prizes for unmeasurable attributes and achievements, like "Neopet With the Cutest Laugh" and "Shop With the Cleanest Bathrooms." </p>
				<p> <b>*</b> Come up with an arbitrary number and have people guess how many of something an item contains. For example, how many pairs of Petpetpet Slippers are in this Purple JubJub Biscuit Jar? </p>
				<p> <b>*</b> Host an annual White Elephante game (a Neopian take on the White Elephant / Yankee Swap / Dirty Santa game) every December where everyone contributes a funny gift. Mine would be the book <i>Influence of Potatoes on History</i>. </p>
				<p> <b>*</b> Set up scavenger hunts where you win a prize if you're the first person to find three unsearchable things, like the Pet Profile page for a Steampunk Jetsam, a Stamp Album that contains the Spirit of Slumber Stamp, and the profile of a one week-old player whose username begins with M. </p>
				<p> <b>*</b> Have a monthly book club where we all role play like we read a Neopets book and critique it. Like for <i>Barallus The Brave,</i> we could talk about how the end of Chapter 7 had an amazing cliffhanger when Master Vex's accountant reveals himself to have been Vex himself the entire time, but then Chapter 13 was a complete letdown because Barallus trips over his untied shoelace and messes up the whole caper he'd been plotting up to that point. *sigh* Oh, Barallus. Every time. </p>
				<p> Would you join my guild if I made one? <a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=spreadkindness">Click here to let me know.</a> If enough people are interested, I'll do it. </p>

				<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/toy_kaured.gif" class="wrapleft"></p>
				<p> I'm one of those people who loves to hear a good neo-backstory. I want to know what inspired you to start collecting a certain type of item for your gallery, why you chose your neopets' specific breeds and colours, and what drew you to pursue your unique neo-goals. </p>
				<p> If you are not one of those people, you probably won't like this blog post because it's going to be all about the backstories behind my pets. Might I interest you in <a href="//www.neopets.com/~KindnessChallege">one of</a> <a href="//www.neopets.com/~_Be_Kind_">my other</a> <a href="//www.neopets.com/~SpreadKindness">pet pages</a> instead? </p>
				<p> If you share my love of backstories, let me introduce you to my pets! </p>
				<p> <b>My eldest is <a href="http://neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=SpreadKindness">SpreadKindness</a>.</b> I painted her Orange so she would look like a tiger – a symbol of strength and power in my culture. (My mom was what you would call a <i>tiger mom</i> and I believe she was the one who nurtured me to become an ambitious, hardworking adult.) A very sweet Neopian gave me the points to buy the Orange Paint Brush because they wanted to help me honor my culture. If you visit SpreadKindness's profile, you'll notice a flag behind her. Neopets won't let me type out the name of the flag (which is weird, because they're the ones who named it) but it's a symbol of solidarity, allyship, and pride for my best friend who is part of the LGBTQIA+ community. </p>
				<p> <b>My second pet is <a href="http://neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=_Be_Kind_">_Be_Kind_</a>.</b> I painted her Origami in honor of my Asian heritage. Behind her, you can see a Charming Spring Background, which I selected because it depicts these gorgeous trees in bloom that remind me of the way my trees look in the spring. The only difference is my trees bloom these bright purple buds. If you know of a Neopets background with purple budding trees, please <a href="/www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=spreadkindness+-invalid_characters-">let me know</a>! </p>
				<p> <b>Next we have <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=KindnessChallege">KindnessChallenge</a>.</b> He's a Christmas Wocky. I've always wanted a Christmas pet because Christmas is a very special time of year for my family, and someone was kind enough to gift me a Christmas Wocky Morphing Potion, so voila! KindnessChallenge has the Holiday Home Background because it reminds me of the cozy feeling I had at Christmas time at my grandparents' house as a child. I lost my grandmother two years ago, and I still miss her dearly, so those memories are precious. </p>
				<p> <b>And finally, there's <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=JensBlog">JensBlog</a>,</b> whose page you're on right now. JensBlog is a Red Kau, my only pet without a "special" colour. One day, I'd like to paint her Spotted, but lately I've been spending all my points on my <a href="//www.neopets.com/~SpreadKindness">Spread Kindness project</a>. I chose to make her red for now because it kind of makes her look like a Dala Horse, which is a traditional symbol of my Swedish heritage. (I know I mentioned earlier that I'm Asian, but I'm also half-Swedish!) Behind her, you can see a Romantic Sunrise Background with a picturesque beach view. My partner and I got married on a lakeshore at sunrise, so it seemed perfect. </p>
				<p> Well, now you know a little more about me! :) If you haven't had your fill of backstories yet, why not read <a href="//www.neopets.com/~_Be_Kind_">the backstory about my gallery</a>?
				</p><p> <b>*** HUGE UPDATE ***</b> A very, very kind person whose name I won't reveal gave me a Spotted Paint Brush!! Can you believe it!? It's hard for me to explain how special this is, but I want to try because my heart is so full. </p>
				<p> My husband and I sometimes have trouble communicating with one another because we are differently abled. But two ways we're able to feel connected to one another are (1) spending time around animals together and (2) eating yummy food together. </p>
				<p> One time, we were on a road trip and we passed a field of Holstein cows, which we both love. (Holstein cows are the white cows with black splotches all over them, like how a Kau looks when painted with a Spotted Paint Brush.) We both love cows, so I said, "Look, honey, moo-cows!" Ever since then, whenever we see cows on the side of the road, we always call them "moo-cows." </p>
				<p> We also have a long-running debate about whether Chick-fil-a is overrated. I stand by my opinion that Chick-fil-a has the yummiest food out of all the fast food chains, but my husband refuses to even consider Chick-fil-a in the running because he thinks it's too expensive to be considered fast food. And - I kid you not - this debate comes up at least once a month. (Chick-fil-a's mascot is, of course, the Holstein cow.) </p>
				<p> Look, I know it may be silly to be this excited and emotional about getting to change the color of a virtual, fake animal. But listen: The friend who gifted me a Spotted Paint Brush didn't even know why it was so important to me... They just knew I wanted it, and so they gave it to me. Wow. This moment is so special.

				<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bbo_earn_np_easy.gif" class="wrapleft"></p>
				<p> <b>Jen's Neo-Book Reviews | A Parody</b> </p>
				<p> After reading <i>How to Earn NP the Easy Way</i> cover to cover, I gotta say, I was impressed!  </p>
				<p> Before I talk about that though, let me ask the obvious question: Is earning neopoints REALLY easy if you have to read a 200-page book about it? </p>
				<p> Fortunately, the answer is YES.
				</p><p> This book contains a lot of helpful information for people whose primary goal is earning a ton of neopoints. There was great information about <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Mavrodaphne">restocking</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/~SilverCyanide2">playing the stock market</a>, and <a href="//www.neopets.com/~boochi_target">making Food Club bets</a>. </p>
				<p> For people like me who don't enjoy restocking or the stock market and don't have an account old enough to take full advantage of Food Club opportunities, the book contains a chapter on <a href="//www.neopets.com/~SpreadKindness">quick, easy ways to make neopoints</a>. </p>
				<p> My biggest takeaway from <i>How to Earn NP the Easy Way</i> is that earning points truly is easy... It just takes time and patience. The opportunities to get rich quick are few and far between and require a good amount of luck. </p>
				<p> 8/10, would recommend. </p>

				<p> I think I accidentally inflated the price of the Orange Coral Wardrobe today. </p>
				<p> Every day, I buy a bunch of a certain item to give away for my <a href="//www.neopets.com/~KindnessChallege">Spread Kindness project</a>. Today the item was the Orange Coral Wardrobe. </p>
				<p> This morning, I could buy them for like 2,500 points each. Now I can't find one below 4,000. </p>
				<p> There was this one store that had 14 of them, and I bought all 14. You know how you can <a href="//www.neopets.com/market.phtml?type=sales">check your sales history</a>? I wonder if that person is like, "What is WITH that chick? Maybe we should check on her?" </p>

				<h2>about me and my blog</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/cloud_aisha_pen.gif" class="wrapleft"></p>
				<p> Y'all, I LOVE a blog. I don't know how old you are, but back in my day when blogs first became a thing, EVERYONE had one. In ye olden days, blogs didn't have themes... You just sort of shared every thought you had in your mind, like in a diary.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, I stumble upon someone's defunct blog and read all their innermost thoughts and start rooting for different storylines in their life... And then I get disappointed because they eventually stopped writing and now I'll never get closure about whatever was happening when they trailed off. </p>
				<p> Anyway, if you're wondering what kind of blog this is going to be, it's definitely that kind. I'll probably get bored of writing it one day. But today is not that day. </p>
				<p> <b>If you're looking for more of a theme-y page to browse,</b> might I suggest <a href="//www.neopets.com/~_Be_Kind_">one of my other pet pages</a> where I write about different elements of Asian culture or <a href="//www.neopets.com/~KindnessChallege">another one of my pet pages</a> where I write about random acts of kindness or <a href="//www.neopets.com/~SpreadKindness">yet another one of my pet pages</a> where I write about how to make neopoints? </p>
				<p> I do have other themes that pop into my head every once in while where I'm like, "That would make a GREAT pet page!" For example: </p>
				<p> <b>*</b> I'd love to become a Neopets gossip columnist and write a blind items blog to dish on what all the faeries are up to </p>
				<p> <b>*</b> I also think it would be super fun to write book reviews for Neopets' books... Because, you know, you can't actually read them </p>
				<p> <b>*</b> Or it would be cool to be a Neopets influencer and make spoof images and videos of my neopets doing things like pursing their lips together into duck faces or walking you through their morning skincare routines </p>
				<p> But alas, I don't think I have enough free time to be consistent with any of those ideas long-term. That said, I totally support YOU taking one of those ideas and running with it. If you do, please <a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=spreadkindness">let me know</a> so I can bookmark your blog. </p>
				<p> Oh, did I mention, Welcome! I hope you enjoy it here. :) </p>
