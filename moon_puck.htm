DISCLAIMER: <i>I wasn't required or forced to make this petpage application!</i>
<p>Hello Carby and welcome to my application for Reborn! <br>Throughout this application I hope you express my desire to add Reborn to my family and let you know how he'd be developed as a character. 
<br>Thank you for visiting- enjoy!
</p></div>

Reborn <i>used</i> to be known as Smokey, an average tom cat with an adoring family. As most young cats do, he has a fascination for all things off limits and outdoors. Most days, he runs out into the woods behind his house to explore, jump in leaves, and chase local wildlife. 
<br>One day he hears his family calling for him from their back door, but he drives himself further into the woods than he's ever gone before. He stops to nap in a small den and when he wakes, he's found that the woods look very different than before.
<br>While he napped, he'd perished in a fire and everything he knew had changed. Unable to hear or smell, he was too far from home to find his way back naturally. 
<br> Now poor Smokey wanders the woods as a spirit reborn from ash, trying to find a way back to his family. As one might imagine, he begins to look inward for comfort and answers.

<br><p>Smokey thinks very highly of himself and wasn't the most user-friendly feline before his demise. He's stubborn, curious, self-absorbed, and typically unappreciative of others. He has a sweet side but constantly finds that he's less aware (or uninterested) in the feelings of others around him. <br>
He constantly thinks of returning home and has to rely on himself- which is proving to be lonelier than he ever could have imagined. In addition to being lost, he doesn't quite understand what's happened to him and what this new form of his entails. Smokey has a lot of searching inward to do!

<p>By the time I woke up, it was daytime. Sunlight filtered through the naked branches of the charcoal-black trees. As far as I could see, the forest all around me had been stained in soot and ash, a dreary gray landscape. At least I assumed it was soot and ash - try as I might, I could not smell it. Whatever it was, it had even stained my beautiful gray coat, now dark like the trees that were around me. The previous night had been dreadful, and the heat had been insufferable for however long it lasted. However, with the dawn of a new day, I felt weirdly okay… for the most part. <br>My ears kept flickering, but I could not hear anything. I could take deep breaths, but I could not smell anything. For moments, perhaps minutes, maybe longer, I thought it had been the fire - perhaps it had burnt away the sounds and smells of the forest. It could be possible, couldn't it?
</p><p>
Trying not to think too deeply about it, I looked all around. With the trees charred, the noises gone, and the scents missing, it felt as though I was somewhere else entirely. Home was south from here… wasn't it? Oh, but I had taken a turn west at some point, then headed the opposite direction when I heard my caretaker call… My thoughts had become muddied. Unwilling to simply sit there and let the day go by, I picked a direction and began walking. Surely, one way or another, I'd make it home. <br>So I would walk deeper and deeper into the forest, retracing my steps to the best of my abilities - and then, someday, I'd make it home, wouldn't I? Without smell, without hearing, it would be hard… but not impossible, right? My coat may be different, but my caretaker would recognize me… would they not?
</p><p>
… there was nothing wrong with me, was there?

Hello Carby! You know me but it's probably been a minute since we've gotten to check out facts about each other!
<br>I'm 28, very confused about life, and somehow very much in love with it too. My favorite things in the world are cats, ornate bottles, my career, Harry Potter, and my family. <br>In the real world I'm a SLP at an elementary school. If you're not sure what that is, I essentially teach kids how to properly articulate sounds, expand their language, and work on fluency strategies! I have a few cats of my own and I also helped to run a cat rescue for 10 years. When I'm not working my husband and I like to do as much as we can outdoors- I especially love taking our cat on long car rides, fishing, archery, hiking and horseback riding. When at home though, you can usually bet that I'm just chatting with friends, watching movies, or drawing!

<p> On neopets I spend most of my time on the boards, entering the BC, and creating characters (often creating and then revamping over and over because I have issues sticking to layouts). My favorite neopets species are all of which remind me of cats. So far I have a pretty good collection of kougra, wocky, aisha, acara, and xweetok. 
<br>Recently, I've returned from a hiatus after moving to another state and handling family things on the day-to-day basis. It's been chaotic trying to get back into the swing of things but it feels good to be back!

<br>You can preview the outfit I'd love to give Reborn above, as well as the desired petpet and p3! I think overall these fit well together. The blobus reminds me of the ash particles coming off of the design I gave Reborn and the outfit kind of represents how he's lost in the woods and trying to find a way out.

A good amount of my pets have trophies but their lookup coding hides the trophies. This is what I'd dress him in and the petpet/petpetpet combo.

</p><p>This is a preview of what Reborn's lookup would look like! It's doctored here but you can see the live view on moon_puck if you click it the preview image.
</p><p>Reborn would be placed on my <b>main</b> account: Piratetwins_1994, so that he may stay with the majority of my cats!

<p>At this point, you may be wondering why I'm applying for Reborn and the answer is simple: he's absolutely precious and I feel like he's perfect for the cat family. 
</p><p>All I really want out of neo is to chat with friends, create fun characters, and to collect all the cute cats! The species I consider cats are kougra, aisha, xweetoks, wocky, and acara. Most recently I've started the gather up some acara and wocky! While a converted grey wocky would fit the bill, I wanted to throw my luck into applying for Reborn because his name sparked an idea and I can't resist his big sad eyes!
</p><p><b>I mean, look how cute he'd look with the rest of my family! <b>Wockies are the best of course, because their noses are purrrfection and their ears look so soft.</b></b>

<p>If you've made it this far and are still interested in anything I say, that's great! I'm super excited! But it's not time to leave.
<br>Thank you so much for reading my app and considering me for Reborn (Smokey), I'd feel extremely privileged to have him join the family, but I understand that he'll be in a good home no matter where he goes. I just hope you have fun finding the perfect one for him!
