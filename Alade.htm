What's on the tin. 
</p><p>
Set primarily in London— a perennially rainy place with very good curry, and packed to the gills with people from all walks of life. There is a stark contrast between the haves and have-nots, but for every rich businessman there's a starving artist. The counterculture scene is wild and avant-garde, and London is famous for its creative output. In theory, that should make up for the crowded Tube, constant mist and rumors of the supernatural. </p><p>

Fae, demons, fallen angels... people innumerable have sworn to have seen them, and made a lot of psychologists quite a bit of money. (In fact, some psychologists are in on the whole bit. London isn't exactly a city of ethics, either.)</p><p>
Skeptical? Next time you ride the Tube, look — truly look at the reflection of strangers on the windows, and don't blink quite yet when you swear your mind is playing tricks on you. They're there. It's just that the whole world seems quite more sane when you deny it.

Araphael is a kind, welcoming angel of death. They escort souls to the afterlife, leading them to the proper channels. They care greatly about humans (and are an incorrigible gossip when it comes to scandalous deaths). 
They make it a point to learn how the deceased take their tea (or coffee, though they can't help but frown when they don't like a proper cuppa), and little bits about them that makes their transition easier.

Alex's true name is Aztatoth… a source of painful embarrassment for him. He was born under Lovecraftian circu<i></i>mstances and is half-abomination himself. However, Alex just wants to be a normal kid. His blood has made him a STEM genius — he excels at math and physics, thanks to his eldritch sight. However, he is incredibly mediocre at everything else. He loves baseball and milkshakes.

Azyrel is a very stressed guardian angel. He has reason to be—in no small part because of his assignment, <i>Hayden Atherton,</i> and the fact he…may have broken federal celestial law. You see, he contributed to a bit of a bureaucratic error that gave Hayden another chance, but he also defied the Almighty. Azyrel is a bundle of nerves and a bit of a pushover, but a profoundly kind and hardworking soul.

</ul><hr>

Zerakiel is a fallen seraphim. He's not particularly impressive looking— he's pretty puny, but he packs a mean left hook. He is incredibly passionate about what he believes in, and has a very "my way or the highway" mentality; it was his rebellious streak that caused him to fall in the first place. Two of his wings were ripped off in a mosh pit; he's an intense individual, and sometimes his attempts at good are reckless.

Bound to Earth in the 1500s by a warlock who knew his True Name, Belgrath has had to do a lot of soul-searching and radical acceptance. As a result, he's a pretty chill dude now. What he lacks in confidence he makes up for sweetness and chill, man. However, he is prone to bottling up his emotions and exploding later. He has the powers to drain people of will (a sensation deemed lacorania) and take them to realms of dreams that reflect their inner being. He is married to Halen Elkano (aka Halenye).

Hayden was not always put together and calm. In fact, at one point, he was not alive at all. A bureaucratic error in the afterlife gave him a second chance — one he decided notto screw up. Since hopping back into the realm of the living, an odd creature called the Amalgam — a manifestation of human suffering — hitched a ride with him. In his new life, Hayden is a therapist that also deals with supernatural problems, or non-human clients. (He is also a closet metalhead.)

Hestiel tries. He really, really does. But that doesn't mean he's any less annoying or holier-than-thou, despite being a fallen angel. He likes things prim and proper, and is rather uptight (which—naturally—makes him the target of many jokes). He runs a tea shop called Cafe Greenleaf that caters to both humans and the supernatural.

You know the kind of person that has kale smoothies and wakes up at 5 AM to do yoga? That's Lester. On the surface, he has it all: rich, tall, dark and handsome, immortal. However, he barely has anything together, and is secretly a retentive, anxious mess. He doesn't let a whole lot of people in, but when he does, it's for all eternity. He is very protective over things he deems "his," and incredibly generous when he wants to be. Key word: wants. He can be exceptionally selfish and oblivious sometimes, but always means best for the people he loves.

Insufferable. Micro-managing. On an endless power trip. That's what happens when you're a seraph — an incredibly powerful angelic being — at the top of heaven's bureaucratic pecking order. Lyaph can and will host meetings that should have been an email, takes 10 minutes to order Starbucks, and uses the word "synergy" far too often. He is a stickler of the law to an insane degree, with very little empathy or regard for "gross Earth matter" (aka humans). He thinks he is superior to everyone else, and thinks fallen angels are even worse than demons. He is ruthless and power-hungry.

Norel is a murder detective at the CBI (the Celestial Bureau of Investigation). His job is terrible, and has made him fairly jaded and cynical. Though he usually means well, he can have a holier-than-thou attitude and be brutally judgmental. He is uptight and reserved, letting very few people in. In short: he's a square and loves stationary.

On the inside, Audret is a cruel soul, only interested in the pursuit of occult knowledge—and he will do whatever he needs to get there. He is a petty, resentful man, often irritable and hateful. Bad vibes, dude, bad vibes. Despite his sickly appearance, he is a powerful occultist.

In truth, Lord Ambres is not a very good vampire. He's not very dastardly, or even good at scaring people. He's much more concerned with his appearance than anything else (even if he is a bit stuck in the 1700s), and has spent much of his undeath guzzling—ahem, adult juice—throwing lavish ba<i></i>lls and living la vida muerte. He is a finicky fop, screams at the sight of rats, and collects fine china like a solemn duty.

Dr. Anvon is a crotchety old man, rather cold and distant to everyone except his "son" Matiene. He started off as a regular ole doctor, but soon became obsessed with the pursuit of eternal life and the occult, dabbling in the penumbra between science and the supernatural. He's generally selfish and dismissive of other people's emotions, heavily repressing his own.

Auver was orphaned at a young age, and after living on the streets for some time, was taken under the wing of Bephael, an immensely sketchy "priest." Little did he know Bephael would be such a blasphemous mentor, roping him into the grave digging and resurrectionist business.<p>
Auver always aspired to be more, and feels trapped and depressed by his gruesome work. But what other prospects are there for him? Melancholy, solemn and rather shy, Auver doesn't open up to most, and certainly says nothing of his profession. For all intents and purposes, everyone thinks he simply works at a parish. If only they knew…

Since he was a young boy, Tomas had glimpses into other realms—some fantastical, some terrible, all real. He grew obsessed with depicting what he saw in his dreams and waking visions. He believed himself a prophet, given a gift and obligation to show the world: the true gods, the great cosmos, wild futures, etc. 
<p>Predictably, the world thought he was insane. He was an intensely talented individual, however, and managed to get by on commissions from eminent noble folk long enough to spawn a massive body of work.

Bephael is a demon that masquerades as a priestly grave keeper. Nothing could be farther than the truth. In fact, Bephael takes advantage of his proximity to the dead, making both profit off of them and using them in necromantic experiments. His "apprentice" Auver is his lackey and errand boy, often dealing with most of the exhuming.

Ginesia is kind but shy, often lost in a world of her own imagination. She is one of Lady Ofelis' servants, working as a cook and maid in her estate. She is privy to the supernatural but keeps her mouth shut; she knows there's something strange and occult about her boss but only rarely can she muster the courage to really, really look. She is a quiet girl who struggles with her own traumas, and tends to keep to herself.

Gildril is an ancient nature entity; he walks the line somewhere between demon and fey, offering powers of hallucination, mind control, fantasy, creation, good fortune/crops, coercion and druidic magics. He takes the form of a beautiful but terrifying buck with opalescent green fur. He has also been seen taking the form of a satyr.

The Baron of Northlith (Alexander Abastel) comes from a long line of nobility, largely defunct in Eldridge. He grew up accustomed to an elite status and despaired when the family fortune ran low, for his father was a ne'er-do-well that guzzled money for his vices. Among the occult, the Abestels were well-respected and regarded in generations past; Alexander saw they were but a shadow of their glory and struck a glory with the demon <i>Gildril.</i> He is impetuous, manipulative, and cruel. Alexander sold his soul long ago.

Lady Ofelis is incredibly charming, with an air of strong dignity about her. She is intelligent, well-spoken and witty, with an unpretentious yet ladylike air. She adores poetry and the arts, and by day, runs a curiosity shoppe and museum named the Curio Ofelis. It is a curated collection of occult works and cryptid taxidermy. Many dismiss it as sensational entertainment, but it's all real… people just don't want to believe in it. By night, she is a sorceress. She sold her soul to the demon Zoedria in exchange for immortality, power and arcane knowledge. She has a soft spot for abandoned and neglected things.

Just the sight of her tends to drive people insane. While it's hard to attribute anything human to her, she does have a consciousness and does mourn. It is said that when the conditions are right, you can hear her wailing in lost and forgotten places, longing to go home.

The Pale Shadow was the illegitimate son of Osedo I Edenveil, a prestigious family and vanguard of the city of Oremis. He loved his father; one of the many reasons he took up arms against his siblings in a war of succession. He was slain beside him in a cathedral.<p>
Allegius was known as a gentle, melancholy soul, a painter and artist deeply sensitive to the world, arts and hearts and souls of those around them. And… when turned inward, it was his undoing. Little did he know how badly tampering with the magic of his bloodline would go…

Auguist Decroix is the son of the prominent Lord-Vicar Gascogne Decroix, a lord in service to the Catalunyan Church. In other words: his dad is a big deal, and thus, he must be a big deal, too. From birth, Auguist had to step into the shoes of a giant, all while keeping his most private self a secret; he is a sorcerer that wields necromantic magics, disguising them as miracles and Church-approved propaganda. The Inquisition and Church as a whole use Auguist as a special weapon in their anti-witch and magic crusade (ironically), due to his abilities to nullify and/or siphon magic. As thus, Auguist considers himself "a card house of lies, awaiting ruin." Until then though, he will pretend to be an upright, saintly, divine-blessed paladin…to survive.

Hadin is a confessional priest in the witch's haven of Oremis, a bastion of freedom in the midst of Church and Inquisitorial incursion into the rest of the Kingdom of Basca. He came to Oremis for sanctuary, as he worships a Church-unapproved entity: Daum Ga, the Wheel, a mysterious god from Bataa, a small country in the northern West. He is a gentle, kind, empathetic soul, dedicated to healing others.

Vicar Casciaro is an elite Hunter in the Hunters' Church, a secret sect that follow an eldritch god of nature, life and death, Behemal, and are devoted to eradicating unnatural Beasts and Dead. Also known as Archhunter Casciaro, as people often think his title should be more than Vicar; he has willingly chosen a "lowlier" position in the Hunter's Church to assist the priesthood and continue training new blood. He is famously humble about it, preferring the role of teaching and mentorship to ruling and/or arbiting, as one does in higher levels of the Church.  He is droll, wise and sometimes world-weary.

In dire times, against a backdrop of war and the routing of casters by the Church and Inquisition, Sister Cruciph found her faith. She had to, against the burning backdrop of her town, narrowly escaping witch trials that left her loved ones dead. Her grief brought her a vision of the celestial, giving her strength to go on. She escaped and joined a convent, living a quiet life—all while smuggling witches and leading secret counter-efforts against the Church.

Elestian is a hakim (esteemed healer) and augur who previously served in an augury temple in Aposta. Elestian is catlike, in that he comes off as quiet and wary, but once he's appraised you, comes sniffing—then, with familiarity, bounding and incessant meowing. He has a great deal of silliness behind his sagely mask—as soon as he likes you, decorum is thrown out. He has much passion and interest in the natural world, psyche and myth.

is a warlock of Mour, an eastern, indigenous god of the land—moors, mist and bogs, will-o-wisps, decay and preservation, death and the unknowable. He is a devout follower of her, and is an exceptionally talented warlock and exorcist, although—few would ever guess, by his puny, ratty exterior. Nor would they guess he is a man of god; he would be a heretic or at least considered a massive faux pas in the Catalunyan Church.

General Kalais a titan in contemporary Arzuqi history and in personality. She is famed for beating back the dictator  Magii Xaron's armies and helping restore the order of Life and Death. Kala doesn't care (and never cared) what people think, however—she follows her unflinching moral compass, and looks to surround herself with people who do the same; she has little sympathy for the morally bankrupt or those who do not answer calls to protection.

Wolfhand  was born Lucretia Vittoria Alighieri to a family of hunters and leatherworkers in Gervasi. Late teenhood, it was amended to Luc-Vitore, though most know them as Wolfhand. (Wolf, if you're close enough). Luc is a wizard with a few spells and magical artefacts at his disposal. One of them is a bell that binds magic, ash and fire into the aspect of a wolf, and emerges from the palm. And thus, the nickname. Rather than take the artisan route in their family, Wolf took up the true, deep call of their blood: monster hunting.
