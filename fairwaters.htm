Hi, I am Fairwaters the Quiggle. I like my owner, julicala, very much. 
Well the_freebie_man_, do you like to laugh?  There is nothing more fun than 
playing in the sun with friends. I love to play 
<a href='//www.neopets.com/space/gormball.phtml'><b>Gormball</b></a> and 
<a href='//www.neopets.com/games/cheat/index.phtml'><b>Cheat</b></a> amongst other 
things.

Once I even saw <a href='//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=110'><b>Capara 
the Kyrii</b></a> in the Grooming Parlour.  She was there buying some special shampoos for her 
hair.  Boy is her hair shiny, she must wash it all the time!  She seemed really nice though, and 
she gave me her autograph :).

I am pretty new around here, but if you want to get together and maybe catch some bands at the 
<a href='//www.neopets.com/prehistoric/ticketbooth.phtml'><b>Rock Concert</b></a> or something, 
why not Neomessage my owner, <a href='//www.neopets.com/randomfriend.phtml?randomfriend=julicala'>julicala</a>. They are always around giving me nice treats to eat or 
taking me to exciting places, I am sure you would get on really well.
<p>
Anyway, thats it from me, I may add some more to my webpage later, if julicala will show me how :)  
<i>(They are currently learning HTML from the <a href='//www.neopets.com/help/html1.phtml'><b>
NeoPets HTML Guide</b></a>)</i>. If you like hanging out with other Quiggles then you should join a 
<a href="//www.neopets.com/neocircles.phtml">Neocircle</a> 
 for Quiggles! Then you will meet lots more Quiggles just like me!
