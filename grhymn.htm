<h3><div id="hl">1) make all species available in the invisible color and make all invisible species fully customizable</div></h3>
<div id="main1">
<p>Currently there are 31/55 species that can be painted invisible. That's 24 species who still long to go unseen. Of these 31 species only 8 can be fully customized (not all items look good on them but the same can be said for pets you can see)!!! This is a tragedy the likes of which have actually been seen countless times in Neopia.</p><p>Anyway, it would most likely be incredibly simple to release the rest of these invisible Neopets (not on pet days) AND to enable the customization zoning for them and the 23 invisible pets that are deprived of their dignity!</p><center><p><img src="http://outfits.openneo-assets.net/outfits/2438431/v/1634783655/600.png" style="width: 300px; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #efefef;"></p><p>

Look at the Neocash items swathed across these unseen beings. Why wouldn't TNT want people to use, and therefor purchase, more NC items?
</p><p>When could these colors be released? March 3rd on the Neopian calendar is 'Cancelled due to lack of interest', seems like a good date to drop a bunch of invisible pets (if not sooner).</p>

<h3><div id="hl">2) enable customization for specific zones on various maraquan &amp; mutant pets</div></h3>
<div id="main1">
<p>47 species are currently capable of being painted Maraquan, all species are currently capable of being transmogrified into a Mutant. Separate items have been created for a while now to allow these species to wear clothes (as long as the color/species combo existed before it was created), as their biology and pose typically differs from that of the original species biology.</p><p>There is, however, one clever species that seems to have figured out how to dress to the nines.</p>

</p><p>There are actually multiple Maraquan and Mutant species that share similar poses and biology with their originals. Some not as close as the Maraquan Mynci, but enough similarity that specific zones could be enabled to allow some to wear specific items.</p>

</center><p>Why should the Maraquan Usul be forsaken from wearing wigs any other Usul could? Why should the Mutant Krawk be incapable of holding what any other Krawk can?</p><p> Why follow the original outline so closely if it doesn't benefit the pet at all? If these species can't have graceful or grotesque poses that really differentiate them from the original, they might as well be able to make use of it.</p>
<p>Additionally, species that are not bipedal already have a version of most handheld items that are designed to be on the ground in front of them rather than in their hands.</p>
<center><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hZT5bma.png" style="width: 300px; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #efefef;"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/j2H78BM.png" style="width: 300px; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #efefef;"></p></center><p>It would be great if these versions of handhelds could be used on Maraquans and Mutants that do not share hand biology with their original species (a bonus would be allowing these items to be used with Baby pets and UCs as well!).</p>

<h3><div id="hl">3) avatars</div></h3>
<div id="main1">
<p>Quite possibly the easiest content to produce that would create the most interest. People love collecting avatars. People love expressing themselves with avatars. Recently, however, there has been a severe lack of avatar content.</p><p>They only ever seem to be released through events, special days or mobile games (and these are almost always overly animated). The last avatars released that didn't fall into one of these categories were Royalboy Lutari and Robot Vandagyre on June 19, 2019.</p><p> This is unfortunate since avatars can drive engagement all over the site, creating short and long term goals for users to work towards. They can even bring the community together to bump brains, as was the case with Chef Bonju and the Wishing Well. Users came together over months and even years to try to figure out these avatars, it would be great to have some mystery to chase after.</p><p>Sure avatars have to be designed, but some of the best avatars are simplistic, with a touch of sheen or blinky text thrown in. The overly animated feature films we have been getting are difficult to express yourself with, less is more! And the thing is, a LOT of art assets already exist.</p><p>There are a vast amount of <a href="//www.neopets.com/refer/buddyicon.phtml">Buddy Icons</a> that are already avataresque in design and size (some are even avatars themselves, or prototypes!). Nearly 800 of them. There are a mix of vibes and quite a few of them could be used as is to release a diverse set (in terms of style AND unlock criteria) of avatars!

<p>There are also just over 600 of the larger buddy icons, which can be rescaled and touched up with a bit of care. I am NOT an artist or anything of the sort, but I have taken the liberty of editing a few of the smaller and larger buddy icons (spending ~5-10 minutes on each).</p><p>

<p>Some animation tweaks, a border and a flip are sometimes enough to make something look like an avatar (I am not capable of good twinkly text lol). A person with a better sk!llset could easily whip the Buddy Icons into great avatars.For more of my edits see <a href="//www.neopets.com/~welch">www.neopets.com/~welch</a></p><p>As far as coding is concerned, a lot of different unlock criteria have been created throughout the years. It shouldn't be difficult to pull the code for various avatars and tweak them (a little or a lot) to work for new avatars. The time saved could be used to think up new code for new criteria!</p><p>For some unlock criteria made by my friend, head on over to <a href="//www.neopets.com/~earthbender">www.neopets.com/~earthbender</a></p>  Verdict: <div id="hl2">EZ CONTENT</div> â€‹
