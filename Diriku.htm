<font size=5><b>W</b></font>elcome to my humble home.  My name is <font color=#7b5121><b>Diriku</b></font> the 
Ixi and I come from a merry little land called Meridell.  So whats Meridell like?  Well erm.. its very green 
(lots of meadows and forests everywhere) and the people there all seem incredibly friendly.  The only trouble is, 
there really isn't that much to do.  To keep from being bored we often have to create our own games, or head 
on down to Merryacres Farm for a spot of <a href='//www.neopets.com/medieval/potatocounter.phtml'><b>Potato 
Counting</b></a> and <a href='//www.neopets.com/medieval/guessmarrow.phtml'><b>Marrow Weighing</b></a>!

<font size=5><b>B</b></font>et you're wondering what a Marrow is eh?!!? Well its a fine vegetable that is found pretty 
much everywhere in Meridell.  Its big and green with different coloured stripes running along it.  Inside the 
centre is soft and pithy with lots of small seeds in the middle.  It may sound rather gross, but you simply can't beat 
a chunk of soft boiled Marrow and gravy!

<font size=5><b>S</b></font>o, what is an Ixi like then?  Well as you may have guessed Ixi's are 
extremely smart and creative.  You only need to take a look at what <a href='//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=169'><b>Sinsi</b></a>
 created in her spare time to see how intelligent we are :)

My owner <b><a href='//www.neopets.com/randomfriend.phtml?randomfriend=keyblades'>keyblades</a></b>, says I am a little minx, whatever that means.  Hmpf, I think I am a very 
well-behaved little Ixi, I mean its not my fault if a few silly Neopets can't take a joke.  I thought it was 
hilarious to have a Jelly war, but apparently Uni's dislike it when their manes get tangled with Gooseberry Jelly :)
<p>
Well I guess I had better get going, I can hear keyblades calling for me.  Ho hum... an Ixi's work is never done! 
By the way if you want a friendly battle, or you just want to say 'Hi', drop <b><a href='//www.neopets.com/randomfriend.phtml?randomfriend=keyblades'>keyblades</a></b> a Neomail 
when you get a chance.
