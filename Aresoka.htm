<p>
Hello and welcome to <b>Buzz Buzz Buzz</b>, Neopia's leading site for all things Buzz!
<br><br><b>Buzz Buzz Buzz</b> began as a simple grouping of Buzz-related info on Aresoka's petpage. As my love for Buzzes grew, so did my desire to make a nice site dedicated just to them. After a lot of debating and thought, <b>Buzz Buzz Buzz</b> was born!
<br><br>
Here you'll be able to find out general information about Buzzes, as well as things like avatar solutions, famous Buzzes of Neopia, adoptables, past Caption Contests featuring Buzzes, and Buzz-related items.<br><br>
If you have a suggestion for something to add, <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=asteroidb_612">neomail me</a>!

<h2>January 9th 2015</h2>
<p>After a very long break, Buzz Buzz Buzz has finally gotten a much-needed update! New colors, items, captions, and even an old hard-to-find Neogreeting have been added. Broken images and URLs have also been fixed.</p>
<h2>February 6th 2013</h2>

<h1>History</h1>
<p> </p>
<center>
The Buzz species first appeared in Neopia on January 11th 2000 as the Fleye. Their artwork was based on a winning competition entry.
<br><img src="http://i819.photobucket.com/albums/zz120/ShortAxel/neopets/1.gif"><br>
On July 24th of the same year, the Fleye was redrawn and renamed. The Buzz retained very little of the Fleye, but resembles the modern Buzz quite a lot.
<br><img src="http://i819.photobucket.com/albums/zz120/ShortAxel/neopets/2.gif"><br>
The Buzz was revamped again, on a date I'm not sure of, into their last form before the conversion. They're basically identical to the modern Buzz.
<br><img src="http://i819.photobucket.com/albums/zz120/ShortAxel/neopets/3.gif"><br>
Today's Buzzes are quite the lookers! They have large, thin wings and sharp spikes down their spine.
<br><img src="http://i819.photobucket.com/albums/zz120/ShortAxel/neopets/4.png"><br></center> 

<h1>Unconverteds and Unreleased</h1>
<p> </p>
<center>
The Buzz only has three UC versions. Plushie, Mutant, and Darigan.
<br><img src="http://i819.photobucket.com/albums/zz120/ShortAxel/neopets/buzz_plushie_baby.gif"><img src="http://i819.photobucket.com/albums/zz120/ShortAxel/neopets/buzz_mutant_baby.gif"><img src="http://i819.photobucket.com/albums/zz120/ShortAxel/neopets/buzz_darigan_baby.gif"><br><br>
On another sad note, the Buzz also has two unreleased versions. Both are Tyrannian.
<br><img src="http://i819.photobucket.com/albums/zz120/ShortAxel/neopets/tyrannian1.gif"><img src="http://i819.photobucket.com/albums/zz120/ShortAxel/neopets/tyrannian.gif"><br><br></center> 

<h1>Trivia</h1>
<ul><li>Buzzes have great eyesight and aerobatic abilities. They're also very fast flyers.</li>
<li>No Buzz can resist a tasty berry or fruit, but they have a greater weakness to Tigersquash. They love them so much that plucking them right off of trees belonging to others isn't unheard of.</li>
<li>Buzzes also love sugary and sticky treats in general, such as Buzz-brand honey.</li>
<li>Common stereotypes say Buzzes are ugly, smelly, no fun, and bite everyone. But none of that is actually true.</li>
<li>Buzzes may look mean, but they're actually very kind.</li>
<li>Although they're one of Neopia's biggest predators, Buzzes have the smallest teeth.</li>
<li>Buzzes take 20% less damage from air attacks in the Battledome.</li>
<li>Buzz are associated with the element Dark in the Neoepts Trading Card Game.</li>
<li>The unconverted Glowing Buzz glows like a firefly, while all other Glowing pets glowed all over.</li>
<li>The Maraquan Buzz is based on a lobster.</li>

<h1>Games</h1>
So far, the only game to feature Buzzes is <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=538">Hungry Skeith</a>! The official game description is below.<br><br><i>Jellies come down the conveyor belt. Blue jellies go in the blue vat. Red jellies go in the red vat. Green jellies, yes, no prizes for guessing where they go, the green vat. It's not a fun job, but somebody's got to do it.
<br>
At the Jelly Factory, the Buzz Foreman takes great pride in making sure that the Jelly is of top quality, and that is where the Skeith comes in - he gets to eat all the other food (ice-cream!) that makes its way down the conveyor belt.
<br>
To play, use the arrow keys to control the Buzz Foreman. Pick up the Jellies with the spacebar and drop them in the correct vat at the back of the factory. The Skeith is not allowed to eat the Jelly, however. If he eats it, or the jelly goes into the wrong container, you will lose a life.</i>

<h1>Directory</h1>
<p>
To put it simply, for those who don't know what they are, unconverted pets feature the old Neopets art. They can no longer be created and therefore no new ones can be made. The only way to get a UC is to adopt one from the pound, adopt one from a user, or trade for one. To learn more, check out the <a href="//www.neopets.com/~koneko">UC Guide</a>.
<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/pets/closeattack/buzz_mutant_left.gif" class="left"> If you'd like your Buzz to be added here, please send me a <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=asteroidb_612">neomail</a> with the following. If you ever wish to have them removed, just send me another mail! Please only have me list UC Buzzes you plan to keep, at least for a decent while. If I see a listed one UFT, they'll be removed.

She spends hours upon hours playing games, and loves every moment of it. In fact, she even has a beautiful trophy room containing a gold trophy that she's earned for every game to exist since she was four years old. And that's quite a lot!<br>
She loves to munch on junk food, most especially sweets, and spends a very great deal of time playing with her Babaa, Button, and her Veespa, Space. She collects balloons, blocks, plushies, and miscellaneous game memorabilia. Her home is overflowing with her hoards, and she's always eager to play.<br><br><b>Occupation Overview;</b> Soka adores her job as the official Game Maintenance Manager, and devotes countless hours to her work every single day. However, you may be wondering what exactly a Game Maintenance Manager is, and what they do. And just in time, here's Soka to explain!<br><i>To put it simply, I'm the head of the group of pets that perform maintenance on the games and keep them running. You've probably never heard of us or what we do because that's part of the magical mystery of the games. We do most of our work in the dead of night, tweaking and fine-tuning and updating the games with lightning-fast speed. In fact, in the time it takes you to send your score and restart the game, that very one could have just been updated by myself or one of my workers.<br>
As the Manager, and not just an Updater, I oversee all of the Updaters and have to approve their work before it goes out. And you know what that means? Days and days of playing games! I check and make sure that my workers didn't miss anything, and fine-tune their work if necessary. However, since I train them all myself, they've yet to miss a thing.</i>

<br><h1>The Night the Hasees Stopped Bouncing</h1>
<img src="http://i819.photobucket.com/albums/zz120/ShortAxel/neopets/aresoka.png" style="float: right;"><br>
The screeching of an alarm and flashing red lights woke the Plushie Buzz with a start. She sat straight up, a strange feeling running through her as she pulled herself from the land of dreams. For a moment she was confused, but quickly snapped out of it. The alarms meant one thing: there was an emergency with a game that couldn't possibly wait another moment, and only the Game Faerie herself could fix it. 
<br><br>
She grabbed her belt, equipped with all the tools she could ever need, and made her way to the door. A fluffy Plushie Babaa looked up from her own little bed, curious about what was going on. "Don't worry Button, go back to sleep. I won't be gone long," the Buzz assured her petpet as she turned off the alarm and tiptoed out of the room, hoping to not wake her Veespa too. 
<br><br>
Right across from her room was the control room, where she could monitor every game at once and quickly be alerted to glitches and bugs. The main screen was flashing bright red, telling Soka that this was not your ordinary problem. She sat down and accessed both the bug and glitch reports. Nothing was there, so she checked the severe malfunctions list. And finally, she found the problem. Something that had never happened before was wrong with Hasee Bounce! 
<br><br>
With great haste she made her way to the Games Room (which was more like the Games Mansion) a short ways away from her home. Luckily she was a very fast flier so it didn't take too long. Upon arrival she saw the same flashing red lights and heard the same alarm, both of which lead her to the Action floor and then to the Hasee Bounce room. She held her breath and opened the door slowly, unsure of what she would find. 
<br><br>
Jimmi and Woogy, the Hasee brothers who were the stars of the game, were lying on the ground and seemed to be in pain! Soka rushed to them as quickly as she could and dropped to her knees next to them. "What happened?!" she cried, "Are you okay?!" 
<br><br>
Woogy opened his eyes and looked up at her, a smile spreading across his sad face as he knew exactly who she was. "Something," he mumbled, "something is wrong." 
<br><br>The doughnutfruits," Jimmi whispered, pointing towards the storage area for their favorite snack. 
<br><br>
With apologetic eyes So
ka stood up and walked over to the large fridge where the game pulled doughnutfruits from. At first glance everything seemed fine, and her confusion grew. But another look told her something was indeed very, very wrong. It was very slight, but every doughnutfruit's color was off by a few shades. It appeared as though something had gone wrong with the refrigerator, causing the doughnutfruits to go bad! 
<br><br>
After fixing the fridge, Soka pulled out some medicine from the emergency cupboards. "Flat-u-less, Medicinal Soap, and Sporkle Syrup should do the trick," Soka assured the poor Hasees as she walked back over to them. Jimmi took his medicine first, and immediately started to feel better. Woogy was a bit hesitant, but with some encouragement he took it all too. "Now you boys will need to sleep and rest, and in the morning you should be fine to start playing again as long as you take it easy," she instructed them. 
<br><br>
She made a call to the local doughnutfruit farmers that supplied the game with its hundreds of tasty fruits. They banded together to make an emergency delivery, and by the time the sun rose no one knew anything had ever happened.

<br><h1>The Tale of a Button</h1>
<i>As a child, Soka was very shy and afraid. She didn't like going outside, meeting strangers or doing anything at all, really. Her parents bought her a Plushie Babaa for her 6th birthday, to try and help her break out of her shell. It worked much too well, and Soka ran off with Button and spent an entire night lost in the Games Room.</i>
