				<h1>the abc's of earning neopoints</h1>
				
				
				<ul class="list"><li><a href="//www.neopets.com/browseshop.phtml?owner=spreadkindness">Support this page - shop at my store!</a></li>
				<p>Hi, I'm Jen! I spend a lot of time lurking on <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/index.phtml">the Neoboards</a> and noticed a lot of new players struggle to earn neopoints. So I made this page to walk you through the basics! Click on each picture below to do the activities described.</p>
<p>Press <b>CTRL + B</b> or <b>COMMAND + B</b> to
bookmark this page!</p>

				
<br><h2>[a]nchor management</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/anchormanagement.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/gif_y17gmc_anchr_keychn.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Anchor Management is one of the "dailies" you can do on Neopets. (There are daily activities you can do on the site to get free items and neopoints.) You can try to fire at the sea monster and see if it'll drop anything valuable for you. Although I've never directly received neopoints from firing at the sea monster, you can definitely sell or trade the items that are dropped! </p>
<br><h2>[a]uctions</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/auctions.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/plu_wocky_auctioneer.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Auctions are underrated Sometimes you can find great deals on these items and resell them for a profit! </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><h2>[b]attledome</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/dome"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_battlefaerie_dagger.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Every day, you can earn up to 1,500 neopoints plus some items in the Battledome. <b>QUICK TIPS:</b> Train your active pet at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/academy.phtml">Swashbuckling Academy</a> to improve its Strength, Defence, Endurance, and Level (not Agility). Always choose to battle a champion with fewer hit points than your pet (because it'll be easier to win). If you're just starting out, equip your active pet with one <a href="//www.neopets.com/dome/abilities.phtml">Ability</a>, a Ridiculously Heavy Battle Hammer, and a Battle Faerie Dagger. These items are cheap but effective! </p>
<br><h2>[b]ob for apples</h2>

<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/applebobbing.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/spf_dapple_apple.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> This is another daily. Once per day, you can try to bob for apples, or some other apple-themed item. You won't always get something, but it's worth a shot! And don't worry about the Flash portion being broken on this daily - you can still click the button to go bobbing. Again, you won't get neopoints from this, but you can sell or trade whatever you get. </p>
<br><br><h2>[c]heeseroller</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/cheeseroller.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/cheese.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> This is a game of chance, and you do have to pay to play (up to three times per day). If you're new to the game and don't have many points, I would recommend that you don't play this game because you can't really control the outcome. However, I have a very low risk tolerance, so maybe you should just ignore me! ;) </p>
<br><br><h2>[c]ollect your bank interest</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/bank.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/toy_bank_icklesaur.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> When you're first starting out, your bank interest each day will be very low. You may only get one or two neopoints per day, depending on how many points you have in the bank. But it's important to get in the habit of collecting your interest every day because, at some point, you'll be getting 1,000+ points per day that you won't want to miss out on! <b>QUICK TIP:</b> Collect your interest BEFORE you deposit or withdraw any points each day. </p>
<br><br><h2>[c]oltzan's shrine</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/desert/shrine.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/sch_coltzanshrine_pen.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Once every 13 hours, you can approach Coltzan's Shrine to try to find items or get better stats for your pets. Although you probably won't find neopoints by approaching the Shrine, I really love getting better stats for my pets so I can perform better at the Battledome! </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[d]aily puzzle</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/community/"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/toy_lupe_babypuzzle.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Another daily! Every day, you can answer the Daily Puzzle to get some neopoints (usually around 300-400) and a special item that can be sold or traded. If you don't know the answer, check the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=5">Help Neoboard</a>. Usually, a kind person will have posted the answer! </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[d]eserted tomb</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/worlds/geraptiku/tomb.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/boo_ddY21_tomb_treasures.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Another daily! You can try to go into the Deserted Tomb to look for treasure once per day. Most of the time, you won't find anything super valuable, but when you do manage to grab an item, you can sell or trade it. </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[d]estruct-o-match iii</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=999"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/toy_mn_blocks.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Three times per day, you can play Destruct-O-Match III. I personally love this game because I can play it on my mobile devices (which you can't do for some of the other games). </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[d]ice-a-roo</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/games/dicearoo.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/dice/red2.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> As often as you want, you can play this game of chance to see how much you can win. This is a somewhat risky game because you have to pay to play, but if you like betting, this game is for you! </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[f]aerie bubbles</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=358"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/toy_darkfaerie_bubbles.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Three times per day, you can play Faerie Bubbles to win some neopoints! </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>[f]aerie crossword</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/games/crossword/index.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_botfae1_water.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Another daily! Once per day, you can play the Faerie Crossword Puzzle to get some neopoints as a prize. If you need help with the answers, ask around on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=5">Help Neoboard</a> or Jelly Neo. </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[f]aerie caverns</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/caverns/index.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/fg_inside_cave.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Each day, you can try to explore the Faerie Caverns and see what you find! <b>QUICK TIP:</b> If you're a new player, I wouldn't recommend this one because you have to pay 400 neopoints to play, and I've read lots of messages from people who say the caverns have glitched out on them, so they haven't received their prizes. </p>
<br><br><br><h2>[f]ashion fever</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/games/h5game.phtml?game_id=1391"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/clo_pteri_suave_shirt.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Three times per day, you can play Fashion Fever to win 900 total neopoints! <b>QUICK TIP:</b> You must actually play the game to win your points... You can't just click "Randomize" and then submit your score. </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[f]ood club</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/foodclub.phtml?type=bet"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/grf_burger_maggotcheese.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Unfortunately, Food Club isn't a great option for new players because the size of bet you can place depends on how old your account is. But if you want to play anyway, <a href="//www.neopets.com/~boochi_target">here are some tips for betting today</a>. </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[f]orgotten shore</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/forgottenshore.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/forgottenshoremap8.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> After you complete the Forgotten Shore Map, you can go searching for treasure once per day along the Forgotten Shore. Need the whole map? You can search the <a href="//www.neopets.com/shops/wizard.phtml">Shop Wizard</a> piece by piece and find each piece for around 1-5 neopoints. I also usually have a complete map <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/tradingpost.phtml?type=browse&amp;criteria=owner&amp;search_string=spreadkindness">up for trade</a> to make things easier on you. </p>
<br><br><br><h2>[f]ruit machine</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/desert/fruitmachine.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/food_desert7.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Once per day, you can play Fruit Machine, which is like the Neopets version of a slot machine. Usually, you'll receive a few hundred neopoints and a small fruit that can be sold or traded (or eaten, of course!). Good luck! </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><h2>[g]iant jelly</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/jelly/"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/jel_pear_whole.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Once per day, grab some jelly from the Giant Jelly! You can eat, sell, or trade it. </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>[g]iant omelette</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/prehistoric/omelette.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/om_tomato2.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Once per day, grab some omelette from the Giant Omelette! You can eat, sell, or trade it. <b>QUICK TIP:</b> Sometimes, the omelette becomes more valuable after you eat one or two thirds of it! Check the prices on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/shops/wizard.phtml">Shop Wizard</a> to help you make your decision about how much to eat. </p>
<br><br><br><h2>[g]rave danger</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/gravedanger/"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/nbo_grave_digging.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Every few hours, you can send in a Petpet to go grave digging (weird, right?). You'll usually find some sort of item that can be sold or traded, but it will take a few hours for your Petpet to finish its digging. </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[g]rumpy old king</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/grumpyking.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/stamp_meridell_skarl.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Once per day, try telling King Skarl a joke. He'll give you a reward if you make him chuckle... And sometimes he'll give you a handful of neopoints even if you don't, just to thank you for your effort. </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[g]uess the weight of the marrow</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/guessmarrow.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/marrow_veg.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Once per day, guess the weight of the marrow! </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>[h]asee bounce</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/games/h5game.phtml?game_id=1393"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/toy_ddy15_hophastoy.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Three times per day, play Hasee Bounce to win neopoints! I love this game because I can play it from my mobile devices, which you can't do with many of the games. </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><h2>[h]ealing springs</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/springs.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/potion18.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Once every thirty minutes, ask the Healing Springs faerie to heal your pets. Sometimes, she'll give your pets hit points to help you go back to the Battledome. But sometimes she'll give you valuable potions that can be sold or traded. <b>QUICK TIP:</b> Go to Healing Springs AFTER playing in the Battledome so she can heal your pets from any hit points you've lost! </p>
<br><br><br><h2>[i]ce cream machine</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/games/h5game.phtml?game_id=1390"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_xweetok_icecream.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> This is one of the games you can play three times per day to earn neopoints. I really like this one because it's easy and relaxing! <b>QUICK TIP:</b> Some of the ice cream scoops that show up as a different colour from the "regular" ice cream scoops are great power ups that can make the game easier! </p>
<br><br><br><h2>[i]gloo garage sale</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/games/h5game.phtml?game_id=1389"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_igloo_whitechocsoc.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Play Igloo Garage Sale three times per day to win neopoints! </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>[j]en's free trades</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/island/tradingpost.phtml?type=browse&amp;criteria=owner&amp;search_string=spreadkindness"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/coltzan_gem1.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> I (and many other Neopians) often put up free trades that you can grab for some extra items to sell or trade! If you see that I have a free trade open, please just offer one item and I'll accept it. :)  </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[k]ass basher</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/games/h5game.phtml?game_id=1310"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/fur_poster_kass.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Kass Basher is another game you can play three times per day to win some neopoints. I love this game because it is SUPER easy and takes less than a minute to play all three times. It can also be played from a mobile device. </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[l]ottery</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/games/lottery.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/scratchcard6.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> I'm risk-averse, so I don't love the lottery. I don't like anything where I pay neopoints and hope to get something back. But if you love the lottery in real life, why not give it a go? </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><h2>[l]unar temple</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/shenkuu/lunar/"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/snowfaerie_moonstaff.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Unfortunately, Flash is broken so you can't see the image of the moon anymore. But once per day, you can pick a random moon phase and hope that you're correct! Even if you're incorrect, you'll sometimes get a small prize that can be sold or traded. </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[m]eteor</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/moon/meteor.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_meteor_rock.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Once per hour, you can poke the meteor with a stick to see if it will drop an item. You can collect up to one item per day! </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><h2>[m]oney tree</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/donations.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/stamp_neo_money.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> You can try to snag up to ten items per day from the Money Tree, which you can then use, sell, or trade. Don't be too picky about what you get, because the items go fast! <b>QUICK TIP:</b> Did you get a junk item you don't want? Donate it back to the Money Tree! When you donate items frequently, you're more likely to get random "Something Has Happened" events which can give you neopoints and valuable items! </p>
<br><h2>[n]egg cave</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/shenkuu/neggcave/"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/negg.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Once per day, you can solve the Negg Cave puzzle. You'll win an item you can use, sell, or trade. Good luck! <b>QUICK TIP:</b> Not sure how to solve the puzzle? <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Abraham_Lennycoln">Here's a pet page that can help.</a> </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[o]pen free trades</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/island/tradingpost.phtml?type=browse&amp;criteria=20"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/can_choc_dubloons.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Browse the newest 20 trades and scroll to find people who are giving items away for free. <b>QUICK TIP:</b> To maximize your chances of winning a free trade, only offer one item and, if you think it's worth it, a few neopoints. No one likes it when someone offers a ton of junk items in exchange for a free trade because they're often posting free trades to try and clear out their inventory. </p>
<br><br><h2>[p]ick your own</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/pickyourown_index.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/med_berry_15.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> As I've said many a time, I don't like to pay neopoints in hopes that maybe, possibly, I could get something in return. But if you want to pay 400 neopoints to try and pick some berries, by all means - go for it! </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[p]otato counter</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=158"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/food_tater9.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Three times per day, count some potatoes to win neopoints! <b>QUICK TIP:</b> If you get to the Potato Counter screen and see a ton of potatoes (like more than 50), just refresh your screen until you see a more manageable amount that you can count quickly. I recommend this because you get more neopoints based on how quickly you submit your answer. </p>
<br><br><br><h2>[p]rizes each month</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/freebies/"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/boo_calendar_burnt.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Once your account is 30 days old, you can collect freebies from this link once per month. </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>[q]uarry</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/magma/quarry.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mmat_obsidian.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Once per day, grab a piece of Shiny Obsidian! This object isn't very useful, so I recommend donating it every day. When you donate items frequently, you're more likely to get random "Something Has Happened" events which can give you neopoints and valuable items! </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[q]uests</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/plu_negg_faerie.gif" class="wrapleft"></p>
				<p> I actually really like (most) of Neopets' quest opportunities. Usually, you can buy quest items for a few thousand neopoints and get cool stuff in return, like increased stats (which help in the Battledome). Try out the <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/braintree.phtml">Brain Tree</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/witchtower.phtml">Edna</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/esophagor.phtml">Esophagor</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/quests.phtml">Faerie</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/earthfaerie.phtml">Illusen</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/darkfaerie.phtml">Jhudora</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/kitchen.phtml">Kitchen</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/snowfaerie.phtml">Taelia</a>, and <a href="//www.neopets.com/space/coincidence.phtml">Coincidence</a> Quests. <b>QUICK TIP:</b> Post about your quests in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=9">Neoboards</a> to get help finding what you need!  </p>
<br><br><h2>[r]estocking</h2>

				<p> One of the most effective ways to make neopoints is to practice restocking. Personally, I find restocking boring and tedious, but <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Mavrodaphne">here's a great guide</a> to get started if you want to try it out!  </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[r]ich slorg</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/shop_of_offers.phtml?slorg_payout=yes"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/hall_petpet1.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Once per day, check out this rich slorg who will give you around 50-100 neopoints just for clicking! </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><h2>[r]ink runner</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/games/h5game.phtml?game_id=1388"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/clo_iceskates.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Play Rink Runner three times per day to earn points! This is a game you can play on mobile devices if you like. </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><h2>[r]ubbish dump</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/rubbishdump.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/dung_rainbow.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> You can grab up to ten junk items per day from the Rubbish Dump. <b>QUICK TIP:</b> Junk items can be annoying to own, so donate them! When you donate items frequently, you're more likely to get random "Something Has Happened" events which can give you neopoints and valuable items! </p>

<br><br><br><h2>[s]econd-hand shoppe</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/thriftshoppe/index.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/clo_mutant_frellie_shirt.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> You can grab up to ten items per day from the Second-Hande Shoppe. <b>QUICK TIP:</b> Junk items can be annoying to own, so donate them if you get them! When you donate items frequently, you're more likely to get random "Something Has Happened" events which can give you neopoints and valuable items! </p>
<br><br><br><h2>[s]cratchcards</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/scratchcard5.gif" class="wrapleft"></p>
				<p> You can go to the <a href="//www.neopets.com/desert/sc/kiosk.phtml">Desert Kiosk</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/scratch.phtml">Haunted Fairgrounds Kiosk</a>, and <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/kiosk.phtml">Ice Caves Kiosk</a> to try your luck at some scratchcards... Personally, I don't think this is worth the risk if you're a new player with only a few neopoints. But if you're into it, go for it! </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[s]hop till</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/market.phtml?type=till"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bg_neoviashop_silhouette.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Don't forget to check your shop till every day! </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>[s]nowager</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/snowager.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/fur_snowager_ice_sculp.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Between 6-7 am, 2-3 pm, and 10-11 pm NST, the Snowager is asleep and you can attempt to steal some treasure! <b>QUICK TIP:</b> If possible, visit the Snowager BEFORE visiting Healing Springs - sometimes the Snowager will wake up and take away your pets' hit points! </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[s]oup kitchen</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/soupkitchen.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/gross_mucussoup.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> If you have fewer than 3,000 neopoints, you can feed your pets for free from the Soup Kitchen. This activity doesn't get you any neopoints or items, but I wanted to mention it because it can save you neopoints because you won't have to spend those points on food! </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[s]tock market</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/stockmarket.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/gif_kneedeep_neopoints.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> If you like investments and stocks in real life, you may as well try your hand at the Neopets stock market! I recommend <a href="//www.neopets.com/~SilverCyanide2">this guide</a> to get started.</p>
<br><br><br><br><br><h2>[s]ymol hole</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/symolhole.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/symol_brown.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Once per hour, send a Petpet down the Symol Hole to see if it can find anything for you. (According to Neopets experts, there is a four-minute time block in every hourly window where your Petpet may bring something back to you.) </p>


<br><br><br><h2>[t]arla</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/freebies/tarlastoolbar.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/toy_tarla_bobblehead.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Every few days, Tarla is around and will give you a gift! It's worth checking a few times each day! </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><h2>[t]dmbgpop</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tdmbgpop.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/toy_bluegrundo.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Once per day, try and talk to TDMBGPOP. Not only will it make your buddy feel less lonely, but you may also get some neopoints out of the deal! </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><h2>[t]est your strength</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/strtest/index.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/gar_testyourstrength.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> This is another risky one - you have to pay 100 neopoints to try and win a prize. You will almost certainly win a prize when playing...but will it be worth more than what you paid? </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>[t]ombola</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/island/tombola.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/boo_tombola_tips.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Once per day, play a sort of version of the lottery - Tombola! </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>[t]reasure of the black pawkeet</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/buriedtreasure/buriedtreasure.phtml?62_-invalid_characters-_C251="><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/pet_pir_parrot.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Every day, try and see if you can find the Treasure of the Black Pawkeet. </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>[t]rudy's surprise</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/trudys_surprise.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/gif_bag_of_neopoints.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> If you do nothing else every day, definitely make sure you play Trudy's Surprise! You'll win a bunch of neopoints every day, and if you play for an entire month, you'll win 100,000. </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>[t]urmac roll</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="/"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/toy_turmacroll_windup.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Three times per day, play Turmac Roll to win some neopoints! </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>[t]urmaculus</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/turmaculus.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/plu_turmac_plushie.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Once per hour, try to wake the Turmaculus with your Petpet! If they succeed, the Turmaculus will give you a prize. </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>[u]ltimate bullseye ii</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/games/h5game.phtml?game_id=1396"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/fur_ultimate_bullseyeboard.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Play Ultimate Bullseye II three times per day to win points! </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>[u]npretty link to the wheel of monotony</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/amfphp/json.php/WheelService.spinWheel/5"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/toy_miniwheelofmonotony.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> The Wheel of Monotony takes FOREVER to spin...so use this link instead to find out what you've won in an instant! <b>QUICK TIP:</b> Sometimes the Wheel of Monotony has bad outcomes... Be ready to face the consequences! </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><h2>[v]ending machine for neocola</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/moon/neocola.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/sloth_token_blue.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> This one is sort of risky... You can spend 3,000-5,000 neopoints to buy a Neocola Token to put in the machine, and hope something good comes out! There's about a 2% chance you get a worthwhile item, and there's also a small chance you get up to 32,000 neopoints. But if you're a brand new player without many points, I wouldn't risk it! </p>
<br><br><br><h2>[w]heels</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/sta_wheel_of_extravagance.gif" class="wrapleft"></p>
				<p> Each day, you can try spinning the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/wheel.phtml">Wheel of Excitement</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/knowledge.phtml">Knowledge</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/prehistoric/mediocrity.phtml">Mediocrity</a>, and <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/wheel/index.phtml">Misfortune</a>, if you dare... </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>[w]ise old king</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/wiseking.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/usuki_hagan.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Once per day, try to impress King Hagan with your wisdom! Even if you don't succeed, he sometimes will give you some neopoints or a book because he feels so bad for you. ;) </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>[w]ishing well</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/wishing.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/stamp_neo_well.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> Twice per day, you can submit seven wishes to the Wishing Well. <b>QUICK TIPS:</b> Put 21 neopoints in the Wishing Well for each wish you make. (This is the minimum amount you must give, but there's no evidence that giving more increases your chances of getting what you wish for.) Also, be very specific about the item you wish to receive. </p>
<br><br><br><br><h2>[x]tra tips</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/book_acarahairtips.gif" class="wrapleft"></p>
				<p> Nothing on Neopets starts with an X! ;) So let me give you some x-tra <b>QUICK TIPS:</b> People on Neopets are (generally) really friendly and helpful. If you're trying to save for a specific item, post about on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/index.phtml">Neoboards</a> or talk about it in your <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/tradingpost.phtml">trades</a>. We'll do what we can to help, whether it be through advice, giving you a deal, or just flat out giving you what you need! You could also create a Paperclip Trade. Put up a junk item for trade and ask people to offer an item that is worth slightly more; then keep the cycle going. We'll support you! </p>
<br><br><h2>[y]e olde fishing vortex</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<a href="//www.neopets.com/water/fishing.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/vor_chaosfish.gif" class="wrapleft"></a></p>
				<p> A few times per day, try fishing for some fish...or other items people have thrown into the lake. </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>[z]eal</h2>
				
				<p>
				
				
				<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/negg_happiness.gif" class="wrapleft"></p>
				<p> Nothing on Neopets starts with Z! So let me just tell you that one of the best ways to get neopoints is by showing zeal for the game and your goals. Do you want to learn how to play the stock market? Ask people for support - they'll be glad to help! Do you want to grow your gallery? Tell people to check out your collection so far - many will donate to support your efforts! Just be excited about the game and you'll naturally find ways to make it work. </p>
