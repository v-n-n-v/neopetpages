    <p><font size="3">Here are some tips I've picked up while playing and browsing the boards. Some of the them are simple, some of them are not, but I hope all of them are useful to someone! If this guide isn't enough for you then make sure you check out <a href="//www.neopets.com/~petpage">this amazing directory</a> for all the pages you could want! 
    
    <p><b>The single best tip I have: find yourself a goal to work towards. Collect a type of item you like. Choose some dream neopets to work towards. Aim for a Battledome pet that can beat any opponent. Complete as many jobs as you can. Try and win the Beauty Contest or the Art Contest. Set a goal for neopoints in the bank. Collect as many avatars or trophies as possible. It doesn't matter what the goal is, having one will make the game so much more enjoyable. And sites like Jellyneo, The Daily Neopets and Sunnyneo will make planning your goals much easier, so check them out! I also really like <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=557462&amp;week=623">this piece</a> on setting SMART goals.</b>
    
    </p><p>Are you returning to Neopets and want to catch up on what you've missed? Here are <a href="//www.neopets.com/releasenotes/">the official release notes</a> and the <a href="//www.neopets.com/roadmap/">road map of future plans</a>. <a href="//www.neopets.com/~whatwenton">This petpage</a> also contains a hiatus return guide!

    <th style=""><b></b><center>DAILIES</center></th>
    </tr><tr><td><font size="2"><ul><li>When you pound or transfer a pet, its fishing level resets to 0.</li>
    
            <li>Magma pets will turn Red when placed in the pound, and Ice pets will turn Blue.</li>
            
            <li>Feed a pteri any food with the word "worm" in it will immediately raise its status to "bloated". This is also true with kaus and anything with the word "milk".</li>
            
            <li>Rather than constantly having to feed your pets, you can put them in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neolodge.phtml">Neolodge</a> to keep them happy and fed for up to 28 days. If you put them in Cockroach Towers this will only cost you 140np per pet. There is no difference between the hotels and no need to select any extra services.</li>
            
            <li>If your pet is feeling depressed or unhappy, you can play with them using a toy from your inventory, or you can take them on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/worlds/roo/merrygoround.phtml">Roo Island Merry Go Round</a> for 50np a ride. It may take a few goes round but they will be happy again in no time!</li>
            
            <li>If your pet looks unhappy or unwell, check out their <a href="//www.neopets.com/quickref.phtml">quick reference page</a> to find out if they are ill. You can then go to the <a href="//www.neopets.com/hospital.phtml">Neohospital</a> to find out which cure to buy or you can try visiting the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/springs.phtml">Healing Springs</a> with the sick pet as your active pet and see if she can heal them for free (the text will either read " <b>Petname</b> is fully healed!" or "All your neopets have their health completely restored!").</li>
            
            <li>Some pet diseases have expensive cures to buy, so when you get an illness like Ugga-Ugga you may wish to skip buying the cure and either visit the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/springs.phtml">Healing Springs</a> every half hour until you are cured or you can feed your pet a Poisonous Jelly. This will change the illness to Neomonia, which can be cured by the much cheaper Medicinal Soap or Cooling Ointment.</li>
            
            <li>On a regular account you can have up to 6 pets. The NC mall allows you to buy up to an additional 10 pet slots, for a total of 16. You can do this on your main and all side accounts. Premium accounts start with the ability to hold 10 pets and can also buy up to an additional 10 pet slots, for a total of 20. You can only have premium on one of your accounts.</li>
            
            <li>Your pet will refuse to read books or accept petpets if the items' names are the same length are your Neopet's name. This is why 4 letter and 3 letter Neopets can be sought after.</li>
            
            <li>Have you heard of stuck pets in the pound and wondered what it meant? <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Gretchu">Here is a stuck pet explainer</a> that covers how pets become stuck and <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Pheruse">here is a guide to finding stuck pets</a> so that you can start looking for pets you like! Generally speaking painted pets are often found and adopted quite quickly so you need to check regularly if you're looking for those, but you can find very well named basic colour pets that have been stuck for a long time if you want one of those.</li>
            
            <li><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Megablade">here is another stuck pet guide</a> that will show you a method for finding pets similar to Pheruse's page. And <a href="http://neopets.com/~poundeds">this guide</a> is slightly more quick start! </li>
            
            <li>While The Lost and Pound website which features Stuck pets is currently having issues, you can still access two types of pages: Go to https://lost.quiggle.org/updates.php#newest for the newest pets or go to https://lost.quiggle.org/neopets/lupe and change the name of the species at the end of the address to the species of pet you wish to search for.</li>
            
            <li>Finding pets using Neopet's search function is currently very difficult is they have underscores in their name. In order to find a pet with an underscore in its name, put https://www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet= in your address bar and add in the name of the pet you're looking for at the end of the address.</li>
            
            <li>Have a pet to trade? There are several different ways to trade pets, most of which happens on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=34">Neopian Pound board</a>. Three of the ways people like to trade pets are the <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Wondertrader">Wondertrade</a>, the <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Cheesy">Pet Auction House</a> and the <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Medicare">UC Shuffle</a> for unconverted pets - these links lead to guides. </li>
            
            <li>For a general guide on trading UC pets, check out <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Danpo">this page</a>, with info on good names and how tiers work.</li>
            
            <li>There is no longer any restriction on the number of pets you can move in a day.</li>
            
            <li>Fountain Faerie Quests do not stack - if you manage to get two, you need to dip your first pet before you give the Fountain Faerie her item and complete the second quest.</li>
            
            <li>Stuck on a name for your new pet? Check out <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Furknot">this page</a> or <a href="//www.neopets.com/~namesly"> this page</a> for some inspiration and lists of untaken pet names. Common RWs (real words) and RNs (Real Names) are very popular. If you're planning to trade your pet then you ideally want a short name - 4 to 6 letters at the most, capitalise the first letter and avoid numbers and underscores.</li>
            
            <li>When painting your pet, you will get any clothing associated with the new colour automatically applied to your pet.</li>
            
            <li>When you adopt a pet from the Pound, you will not get any clothing associated with the colour of the pet. This is not true if the pet is transferred to you from another player, unless otherwise stated! If the clothes appear to be missing after a transfer, go to <a href="//www.neopets.com/customise/">customise the pet</a> and check the currently wearing tab. If the clothes are in the tab as though the pet is wearing them, remove the clothes and save the customisation, then go to the available clothes tab and reapply the clothing. Hit save and your pet should now appear with its clothes!</li>
            
            <li>There are many colours of Neopet out there! Check out the Jellyneo rainbow pool guide to see all the currently available colours: https://wardrobe.jellyneo.net/rainbow-pool/ and start planning your dream pets. The ways to get colours are as follows:
            <ul><li>paintbrushes: see <a href="/~Querquetulana">my Painting Your Pets guide</a> to find out where to obtain. </li><li>morphing potions: see <a href="/~Querquetulana">my Painting Your Pets guide</a> to find out where to obtain.</li>
            <li>Playing with a Magical plushie! Warning, this will change your species and colour to match the plushie (e.g. Yellow Chomby).
            </li><li>The rainbow faerie if you complete one of her quests, or the grey faerie if she borrows the rainbow faerie's powers to reward you. When receiving a quest, it has been revealed that you have a 1.77% of getting a Fountain Faerie Dip either from the Fountain Faerie herself or the Grey Faerie (3.54% chance total).
            </li><li>The lab ray: once you complete the map, you get access to <a href="//www.neopets.com/lab.phtml">the Lab</a> where you may zap your pet random colours.</li>
            <li>Your premium perk: if you pay for premium, every 365 days you can change the species of your pet, and if your pet is currently a colour that the species you are changing to does not have, you can also choose any colour.</li></ul></li>
            
            <li>Looking for a dream pet? Check the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=34">Pound board</a> for the Pound Surf or Lost and Pound threads or visit an adoption agency to check their UFAs and submit your wishes: <br><a href="/~ZYDP"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/opA8Ayv.jpg" border="0"></a> <a href="/~Hootiolado"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1G5oHXo.gif"></a> <a href="/~ziyniai"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/WmFn5VT.gif" border="0"></a> <a href="/~Moonsis3"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0aMLMRI.gif" border="0"></a></li>
            
            <li>Crosspainting is when you apply the clothing of one colour pet to another colour pet of the same species. You can get some really cool results by doing this, for example putting Desert clothing on a Wraith Acara. However, you can't buy Paint Brush clothing so the only way to get it is to have had a pet the right colour to take the clothing off of, as well as the pet that you want to put the clothing onto, and they must both be the same species. In addition, if at any point the pet you took the clothing from is moved off the account, it will take the clothing with it providing the pet is still the original colour. You also can't move the new pet onto a different account and take the clothing with it - the pet will leave the clothing behind as the clothes do not really belong to it.</li>
            
            <li>There is currently a Pound glitch which seems to apply mostly the mobile users. Be extremely careful if you use the pound of abandon a pet - sometimes the website changes the selection and abandons the wrong pet! </li>
            
            <li>In order to attach at petpet (p2) to your Neopet, just put it in your inventory and select "give to (name of Neopet)". As long as your pet does not already have a petpet and the petpet's name (e.g. Faellie) is not the same length as your pet's name, you will get a success notification telling you that your Neopet is very happy with their new pet!</li>
            
            <li>Have a petpetpet (p3) you want to attach? Make sure your active pet has a petpet (p2) attached. Keep the petpetpet (p3) in your inventory and refresh until it attaches to your active pet. The current likelihood per refresh is 1:333. Petpetpets (p3s) are permanently attached to your petpet (p2s) and if you remove the petpet (p2s) from your neopet, the petpetpet (p3) will disappear without returning to your inventory. This is an expensive mistake!</li>
            
            <li>Chombies, Lutaris, Cybunnies, Hissis, Kois, Kikos, Poogles, Jetsams and Rukis can only be <a href="//www.neopets.com/reg/page4.phtml">created from scratch</a> on their Pet Days! You can find out when this is on <a href="//www.neopets.com/calendar.phtml">the calendar</a>. Tonus are released on their Pet Day and in very small quantities whenever the Giant Omelette is completely gone.</li>
            
            <li>Draiks and Krawks are not available to make via the <a href="//www.neopets.com/reg/page4.phtml">Create a Pet</a> page even on their Pet days. The cheapest way to get a Krawk is a Morphing Potion, Transmogrification Potion or let your intended pet play with a Magical Krawk Plushie. To get a Draik you can hatch a Draik egg at <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/draiknest.phtml">the Draik Nest</a> or use a Morphing or Transmogrification Potion.</li>
            
            <li>Lutaris cannot be sent to the Pound and will be permanently deleted ("run away") if you try.</li>

    <li>Use the Jellyneo lunar temple calculator to get the correct answer at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/shenkuu/lunar/">Lunar Temple</a>! You don't need flash to play this even though there are flash elements. Just click on "I propose a challenge to test your sk!lls" to get to the game and then follow the Jellyneo guide. Here is the Jellyneo link: https://www.jellyneo.net/?go=lunartemple</li>
    
    <li>You can still buy and play scratchcards at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/scratch.phtml">Haunted Fairgrounds Kiosk</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/kiosk.phtml">Ice Caves Kiosk</a>. You can still buy scratchcards at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/desert/sc/kiosk.phtml">Desert Kiok</a> but you you can't scratch the cards because they are Flash based.</li>
    
    <li>Play <a href="//www.neopets.com/trudys_surprise.phtml">Trudy's</a> every day to win over 450,000np in 25 days, including 100,000np on the last day. You also get exclusive prizes and boxes to send NC gifts to people (useful for NC trading).</li>
    
    <li>A lot of the games are no longer accessible because Flash was discontinued. There is a browser extension called Ruffle as well as a browser called Palemoon which can bring back Flash for some games. However, Flash is no longer being maintained or updated and therefore all methods of accessing Flash games are security risks and you should be aware of this if you try one of these methods.</li>
    
    <li>The odds of getting something good from the Neocola machine are thought to be 1:2000 vs 1:20 from the Alien Aisha vending machine (although I can't find the thread I originally read this in).</li>
    
    <li>Chances of getting a paintbrush from the Alien Aisha vending machine are not affected by the type of nerkmid you use. Nerkmid types only really affect the amount of NP you receive.</li>
    
    <li>If you find your way to the treasure in Faerie Caverns, you have an 89.9% chance of earning between 500 and 2500np; a 5.1% chance to win 5,000np; a 4.9% chance to win 10,000np and a 0.1% chance to win 25,000np. If you do win 25,000np there is a 10% chance to win a Faerie paint brush! Otherwise you will get a patamoose, Beautiful Glowing Wings, Faerie Caverns Background or Faerie Caverns stamp.</li>

    <li>When visiting the Discarded Magical Blue Grundo Plushie of Prosperity, 10% of the time you will get a plushie, 10% of the time you will get a toy r89 or below, 1% of the time your pet will get sadder, 1% of the time they will get hungrier, 1% of the time they will get smarter; 2% of the time they will be cured of a disease if they have one, 20% of the time they will get less hungry or smarter if their intelligence is under 40, 15% of the time nothing happens, and 30% of the time you will get an amount of NP between 50 and 3000. Regardless of all of that, there is only a 1/1000 chance of getting the avatar each time you visit, meaning it could take almost 3 years.</li>
    
    <li>It doesn't actually matter which square you pick in  <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/buriedtreasure/index.phtml">Buried Treasure</a>. They all have a 12% chance of giving out a prize and it is determined when you click.</li>
    
    <li>The only scratchcards that award the jackpots are the Icetravaganza Scratchcard from Terror Mountain, the Rotting Riches Scratchcard from the Deserted Fairground or the Sandtravaganza Scratchcard from the Lost Desert Kiosk (currently Lost Desert Scratchcards cannot be scratched).</li>
    
    <li>Your chance of winning any prize from a Deserted Fairground Scratchcard is around 24%. The Festering Fortune scratchcard from the Deserted Fairground is the cheapest of the scratchcards sold here if you are using scratchcards to try and level up your pet (one of the prizes). Your chance of winning any prize from a Terror Mountain Scratchcard is less at just over 20%. The cheapest card from here to level up your pet is the Terror Trove scratchcard.</li>
    
    <li>If you are extremely lucky you can get a scorchstone from asking the faerie to heal you at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/springs.phtml">Healing Springs.</a></li>
    
    <li>There is a four minute window every hour where visiting the Symol Hole might get you a reward, and it changes every day. Visit the Jellyneo Guide (https://www.jellyneo.net/?go=symolhole) to find out today's times.</li>
    
    <li>Older, spooky petpets can make your time in <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/gravedanger/">Grave Danger</a> shorter, although it is still randomly decided so is not always the case.</li>
    
    <li><a href="//www.neopets.com/space/coincidence.phtml">The Coincidence</a> is one of the only ways to get Petpetpets without buying them from other players, other than random events. However, it can lower your stats so think about whether you want to take your Battledome pet as your active or not!</li>
    
    <li>Treat bags such as the Halloween Y14 Treat Bag give out prizes randomly determined when you click to open the bag.</li>
    
    <li>Gaining fishing levels gets harder as you level up in fishing, but the prize pool also gets wider with better prizes. You can read the Fishing Made Easy book to increase your fishing level from 0 - 3 in one hit.</li>
    
    <li>A great way of getting an item you want (or a high value item to sell) is to make your 7 wishes at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/wishing.phtml">Wishing Well</a>. Donate a minimum of 21np and wish for an item of a rarity r89 or below. You can wish 14 times in a day! The Wishing Well resets every 12 hours, usually around 4am and 4pm NST at the moment, so check back to make your next set of 7 wishes after these times.</li>

    </tr><tr><td><font size="2"><ul><li>Speed is not very useful in the Battledome, so Air faerie quests may not be worth the NP. Light faeries, space faeries, and the Faerie Queen will all raise your level so if you are close to codestone or dubloon limits in the training schools you may want to think carefully before accepting these quests.</li>
    
    <li>Trying to exit a fight? Go to <a href="//www.neopets.com/dome/status.phtml">this page</a> and if necessary click on the Challenges tab. You can then hit withdraw. The fight will count as a loss but you will have left!</li>
    
    <li>In order to reliably one shot Jetsam Ace on easy, I would consider the following important: a Level 50 pet with the Lens Flare ability (to stop Jetsam Ace hitting you), Strength of 85+, and two constant weapons with at least 11 icons of damage each. I use either two Turned Tooth or a Turned Tooth and a Roxton's Trusty Bowie Knife, but other popular options include the Void Blade and the Scroll of Knowledge.</li>
    
    <li>At higher levels, the best 1 player weapons for constant damage are often considered to be Fan of Swords (20 icons), Sword of Skarsden (17-24), Super Attack Pea (32), Sword of Malum(17-22, only available if you participated in the Wraith Resurgence event) and Blazing Embers (17-22, only available if you participated in the Wraith Resurgence event).</li>
    
    <li>Visit the <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/kitchen.phtml">Kitchen Quests</a> up to 10 times a day to fetch items for the chef. You have a good chance of getting stat bonuses which, particularly at high battledome levels, are a cheaper way of improving your pet than training! </li>
    
    <li>For item farming, the best adversaries to fight go in the following order: S750 Kreludan Defender Robot - Koi Warrior - Jetsam Ace (premium) - Space Fungus on hard (premium), Giant Spectral Mutant Walein.</li>
    
    <li>There are items which can boost your stats! They are quite expensive but can be useful when pushing towards goals. Armoured Negg, Starry Blue Birthday Cupcake, Meridell Potion of Defence, BBQ Porkwich, Cooling Balm of the Warrior and Mano Root Elixir boost defence, Bubbling Fungus, Essence of Drackonack, Starry Yellow Birthday Cupcake, Essence of Mortog, Altador Strength Potion and Jar of Forest Earth boost strength, and Starry Pink Birthday Cupcake, Snegg and Muntando Fruit boost hp. The Elixir of Leveling and Irritable Genie-in-a-bottle can raise your level. Terror Trove scratchcards (and rarer scratchcards) also have a chance of increasing your level.</li>
    
    <li>At higher levels you will also want to add in a freezer type item (e.g. thunder sticks, freezing potion, h4000 helmet, magical marbles of mystery or moehog skull), a bomb (e.g. ghostkerbomb, varia is the bomb, maractite bomb) and perhaps a healer such as feel better soup, jade scorchstone, bag of healing dust or leaded elemental vial.</li>
    
    <li>Ever heard of an anagram sword? These are weapons sold in the Hidden Tower - the Swords of Thare, Reif, Ari and Thigl. They are all high powered weapons with different damage typing (dark, light etc) plus physical icons.</li>
    
    <li>Recommended faerie abilities that are actually useful are: An Icicle (level 25), Lens Flare (level 50), Warlock's Rage (level 200), Rejuvenate (level 300) and Reflect (level 400).</li>
    
    <li>Every couple of weeks you can participate in <a href="//www.neopets.com/prehistoric/battleground/">The Battleground of the Obelisk</a> for extra boons like discount in NPC shops across Neopia, the ability to buy 10NP stocks and increasing your bank interest rate, and cool prizes even if your team lose. Want to know which team to sign up for? <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Oxbridge786">this magnificent petpage</a> uses stats to work out who is most likely to win! Check out the jellyneo guide for more information on how the Battleground works: https://www.jellyneo.net/?go=battleground_of_the_obelisk and get battling!</li>
    
    <li>One of the cheapest ways to train your pet is benchmark training - see <a href="/www.neopets.com/~tear">this page</a> for a wonderful breakdown.</li>
    
    <li>Training for six tan codestones is often more expensive than one red codestone, so at that point it may be worth focusing only on your level until you can move to Ninja school.</li>
    
    <li>When you are exactly level 250, you can simultaneously train your stats at both the <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/training.phtml">Mystery Island Training School</a> and the <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/fight_training.phtml">Secret Ninja Training School</a> in order to level up stats faster!</li>
    
    <li>When you train your Strength to certain points, you get a boost in damage per icon from your weapons. The thresholds fall at the following points:</li></ul></font><center><table width="350" border="1"><font size="2">

Try these pages: https://www.jellyneo.net/?go=neopian_stock_market or https://thedailyneopets.com/articles/stock-market-guide or http://sunnyneo.com/games/stock/index.php and get ready to make some neopoints!</li>
    
    <li>Check out <a href="/www.neopets.com/~SilverCyanide2">this guide</a> for a pretty complete run down of the stock market including different strategies for buying and selling stocks, such as the 15/30, day trading and set price selling methods.</li>
    
    <li><a href="/www.neopets.com/~stepchild2">Here</a> is a more in depth guide specific to the 15/30 strategy if you want to read about that.</li>
    
    <li>Once current prices get above ~45, the fluctuations can be bigger so rises can happen quicker. Keep an eye on your stocks when they get above this level!</li>
    
    <li>Always try and buy shares at 15np and buy 1000 at a time (you can only buy a maximum of 1000 shares a day). If you sell them when the current value is 30, you will double your money. Selling at 45 triples your money and 60 quadruples your money. Most people aim to sell around 60, and some may hold on for a much higher value. It can takes months for shares to pay off at all so be patient!</li>
    
    <li>Neopian share prices are not affected by how many people buy them or hold them, so players cannot manipulate or affect the price of the stock market in any way.</li>
    
    <li>To give yourself the best chance of profit, you're probably better off investing in lots of different stocks rather than one or two and waiting for those to pay off.</li>
    
    <li>If there are no stocks valued at 15 that day, it is better to buy at 16 or 17 than skip a day, as losing out on 1000 stocks for the day is a potential loss of the profit you'd have earned in the future. The stocks update their prices every half an hour so you can refresh to check if any have dropped to 15 if you have time before buying at a higher value.</li></ul></font></td>
    
    <td><font size="2"><ul><li>You can fish with all of your pets every day to increase chances of good items and the Titanic squid avvie!</li>
    
    <li>The rubbish dump and money tree clear at Midnight NST and slowly refill so that is a good time to search for avvie items or good quality things.</li>
    
    <li>The first Saturday of every month is Rubbish Dump day, where more people visit the Rubbish Dump to try and get the avvie and people who already have it go to the Dump to help clear rubbish away. Have you helped out yet?</li>
    
    <li>Keep an eye on the Jellyneo and TDN pages or the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=5">Help board</a> to find out when you can wake the Turmac (Turmy) with your petpet. He gives out items, neopoints and 1/100 times he will eat your petpet which gives you an avatar!</li>
    
    <li>If you are trying to get the Rubbish Avatar (where you discard between 3000 - 4000 items over the course of your account) then a good way to boost your numbers is to go through the Super Shop Wizard/Shop Wizard and look for items selling from 1np. Good choices are Gorunda the Wise, Flutter, Broken Fishing Pole and other fishing items. Any shops selling an item for 1np probably has others so it's worth checking through any shop you find!</li>
    
    <li>If you want to get the Bon Appetit avvie without Flash for the cheapest possible price, make your lightest pet (check their quick refs) very bloated and buy the following items: <a href="/water/process_restaurant.phtml?item=28124">Lemwart Fizz for 7000np</a>, <a href="/water/process_restaurant.phtml?item=28127">Angel Hair Salad for 13,000np</a>, <a href="/water/process_restaurant.phtml?item=28101">Spicy Radish Salad for 28,400np</a>, and <a href="//www.neopets.com/water/process_restaurant.phtml?item=28111">Honeyed Horn of Plenty for 12,000np</a>. This costs 60,400np and you might have to visit several times before you get the avvie.</li>
    
    <li>In order to get the weather avatar or just check the weather, go to <a href="//www.neopets.com/weather.phtml">the Neopets weather page!</a> They have some really strange weather in Neopia.</li>

    </tr><tr><td><font size="2"><ul><li>Want to know how to get started with restocking? Check out these guides! https://www.jellyneo.net/?go=restocking or https://thedailyneopets.com/articles/restocking </li>
    
    <li>Create Jellyneo wishlists of the items you are looking for when restocking to quickly remind yourself of the high value things while you're waiting.</li>
    
    <li>Zooming out your screen lets you see more stuff at once when restocking in a large shop. Don't zoom out too far though or you will make the captcha on the haggle page more difficult!</li>
    
    <li>Despite what it says in the shops, they no longer restock every 8 minutes and instead restock randomly. New items can appear after less than a minute or can take over an hour, and each shop is different.</li>
    
    <li>When restocking in large shops, you could keyword search (Ctrl F) after a refresh to immediately check for specific items, for example any Magical plushie, or search for 10,000 (as in 10,000np) and so on.</li>
    
    <li>When using regular Shop Wizard, you apparently have a 1/13 chance of seeing the lowest price at any given time, and you can keep track of which sections of the site have been searched until you have seen 13 unique sections according to <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162064837">this topic</a>.</li>
    
    <li>Items stocked at 10,000np are often profitable and sell out very quickly. There are some shops (such as Spooky Foods) where there are more loss-making 10,000np items than others, such as Faerie Foods or Super Happy Icy Fun Snow Shop. The Magical Book Shop is a particularly great place as 10,000np and 5,000np books are both often highly profitable.</li>
    
    <li>When planning what to restock, be aware that r100 items are currently bugged and do not show up in shops.</li>
    
    <li>Do not price your items by the estimated value when reselling them, or even by Jellyneo's price guide. You will probably lose neopoints or never sell your item. The way to price your item is to find out its current lowest price on the Shop Wiz or Super Shop Wiz (if you have premium). Then you can choose to price at or near the lowest price, or you can hold off and hope the price rises if you will make a loss.</li>
    
    <li>On very desirable lots, it is best not to haggle with the aim of pushing the price down too far, because the item is likely to be snatched up before you can agree a price with the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper is usually willing to take at least 300 off the listed price if you really want to push it, but it can be best just to offer the asking price (or an easily input number e.g. 9999np) to get the item quickly.</li>
    
    <li>Great places to restock include any food shop (because many players are working on their Gourmet Club pets), book shops (because of Book Award and Booktastic Award), and the Post Office, Shell and Coin shops (because many people are trying to fill their stamp albums). These places also have profitable more common items so are good learning grounds. The following items are commonly requested in quests so can also be good sources of income: clothing, trading cards, beauty products, magic items, food, books, and toys. Food items are also needed in the Kadoatery so are great choices all round!</li>
    
    <li><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Sanskrits">Check out this great petpage</a>for a genre-by-genre breakdown of each NPC shop! I used this guide when I was first getting started with restocking and I still think it's great.</li>
    
    <li>You can also check the <a href="//www.neopets.com/auctions.phtml">Auction House</a> and browse lots at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/tradingpost.phtml">Trading Post</a> for good deals. Make sure that you double check how much items being auctioned are actually worth before bidding (via Super Shop Wizard/Shop Wizard search or checking Jellyneo) as some lots are extremely overpriced. </li>
    
    <li>You can also try and snipe deals from other user shops by searching the Shop Wiz or Super Shop Wiz for any bargains and reselling them at a higher price (though it doesn't hurt to be kind and return something if you think someone has accidentally mispriced something - I once sold a 150,000 stamp for 1np because I was on pain meds and trying to take it out of my shop but used the wrong box. Unfortunately, that's just the way it goes sometimes!). 
    
    </li><li><a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=2">Kauvara's Magic Shop</a> is a place where you can find Morphing Potions, many of which restocking for thousands or millions of NP. However, competition is fierce here so you need to be very dedicated.</li>
    
    <li><a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=45">Tyrannian Weaponry</a> sells one of the most popular battle weapons on the site. Restocking the Turned Tooth usually costs around 40,000np and resells for around 90,000np. The good thing about it is that unlike many other items, it is only rarity value r83 (uncommon) so shows up fairly regularly!</li>
    
    <li>Also keep an eye on <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/igloo.phtml">the Igloo Garage Sale</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/garage.phtml">the Almost Abandoned Attic</a>. The igloo stocks anything below r89 and the Attic stocks anything r80 to r99 at a fraction of what they can sell for on the secondary market! There are limits on the amount of items you can buy from each of these places but they are well worth watching.
    
    </li><li>Petpets are generally considered Hard to Sell (HTS) so reselling them takes a long time. Restocking them may or may not be worth it.</li>
    
    <li>For best results, restock where you can with a wired internet connection rather than a wireless one, and fast internet such as fibre. Having a hand to refresh and use the number pad and a hand to control the mouse is also best.</li>
    
    <li>When pricing items in your shop, make sure not to leave any spaces blank (0s are fine). There is apparently a glitch that means if you leave a blank in a price field, all your items will be randomly priced when you hit save and you may sell things worth hundreds of thousands of np for very little.</li>
    
    <li>To keep your interest up, it's best to restock in more than one shop at a time. Have a few different shops open in different tabs and keep refreshing them regularly. Whenever one restocks with new items, concentrate on that tab and check for any good stuff! Then go back to refreshing.</li>
    
    <li>However, if you're focused on only the really popular shops or want to get the r99s, it is better to concentrate on one shop at a time. Whenever the shop clears, refresh as often as you can until the shop restocks. You should hopefully get first choice of the items, but be quick with haggling and know what you're looking for! Once you're finished haggling there you can try the next empty shop and repeat your refreshing until the shop stocks, and so on, or you can do something else until the original shop clears again. If you refresh often you may well get restock banned quickly, but for some shops that can be worth it. It just depends on your prefered play style. You can still get r99s with a more relaxed refresh rate but it will happen less often and be more down to luck.</li>
    
    <li>I've noticed that often shops that restock with a few items tend to have a bigger restock only a few minutes later. I've not tracked restocks to check this is true, but I believe it to be the case.</li>
    
    <li>Sometimes shops empty. This can happen while you're haggling for an item or while you're browsing. It usually means one of two things: the shop restocked with 0 items in it; or you are restock banned, which means the site thinks you have been refreshing too much or restocking for too long and is making you take a break. During a restock ban, no NPC shops in Neopia will appear to have items in them for you. There are no consequences for a restock ban, it doesn't mean you've done anything wrong, it is just making sure you aren't a bot and also giving other players a chance to restock. Bans can last from an hour to a day.</li>
    
    <li>If all shops empty at once, this is known as a Clear. This happens pretty regularly and is used to advantage in high value item restocking strategies! For these strategies, concentrate on the one shop you're interested in. Once a clear happens (the shops empty), refresh the page as often as possible until the shop restocks. When it restocks, if nothing profitable appears you can move on to the next shop and see if it has restocked yet - if not, repeat the refreshing and so on. This will give you the best chance at getting first choice of the items. If you're not sure whether a Clear happened or if you've been restock banned you can check other shops to see if any have items or check with other restockers to see if they have also experienced a Clear.</li>
    
    
    <li>The third day of every month is half price day in the NPC shops, so get your restock on! However, if you have stock in your shop bought before half price day, be prepared for prices to lower on the Shop Wizard for several days after. You can either adjust your prices to sell or hold out and hope that they come back up.</li>
    
    <li>The third Wednesday of every month is 3% off at the Hidden Tower for accounts old enough to buy things there. It makes a real difference to the prices!</li>
    
    <li>Restocking is often harder on weekends during daytime NST, when most players seem to be online_   I tend to avoid these times as competition for items becomes fierce and you need to be fast. </li>
    
    <li>The current maximum price you can sell items for in your shop is 999,999np. Items are called Unbuyable (UB) if they are worth too much to sell in your shop. The current maximum price you can offer on the Trading Post is 2,000,000np (plus up to 10 items). If you want to sell an item for pure np over this amount, it is a good idea to find a buyer and then set up an auction for them. You can set it to Neofriend only (if you've added the buyer as a Neofriend) and set the start price at anything up to 50 million np with the buyer having to bid an increment that adds up to the agreed amount to get the item. Jellyneo recommends if you have a total of np agreed with your buyer that you halve the amount and put half the total in as the start price and the other half in as the starting increment.</li>
    
    <li>If you have items you wish to sell that you are not allowed to find on the Super Shop Wizard for (such as Nerkmids), you can still bring up the Super Shop Wizard to find the average price of the lowest few listings. Call up Super Shop Wizard, type in the name of the item you wish to search and in the Max price box set a maximum price that seems just above the price you were thinking of paying. Tick the "Price Only (limited)" box and then hit search. The results will give you the average of the all the listings below the price you put in. This will work for any item 999,999np and below.</li>

    <td><font size="2"><ul><li>Want to get into NC Trading? <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=567384&amp;week=693">Here is a great article</a> about the basics. </li>
    
    <li>NC stands for Neocash, the premium currency on the site. You can buy Neocash <a href="http://secure.nc.neopets.com/get-neocash">direct from Neopets</a> or you can buy Neocash cards from third party and <a href="http://secure.nc.neopets.com/redeemnc">redeem them on site</a> (often cheaper and also comes with free gift boxes and sometimes items!).</li>
    
    <li>You can get NC items from the <a href="/mall/shop.phtml?page=&amp;cat=">NC Mall</a>, from spinning the <a href="//www.neopets.com/mall/wheel/">NC Archives Wheel</a> and even from <a href="//www.neopets.com/donations.phtml">visiting the Money Tree</a>.</li>
    
    <li>NC trading is exchanging items bought with Neocash with other players. You find items that you like and offer something you own or can buy of similar value to exchange for the thing you want. Item value is often determined by checking out <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Owls"> The OWLs page</a>, the <a href="//www.neopets.com/~OwlsTwo">OWLsTwo page</a>, the <a href="//www.neopets.com/~waka"> Waka page</a> which is no longer being updated but is a useful guide if OWLs doesn't have a value guide, and the <a href="http://neopets.com/~Valisar">Valisar page</a> for non-wearables such as mystery capsules. <a href="http://neopets.com/~eya">This guide</a> is also helpful for traders who are trying to work out how to value an item that doesn't seem to have a value listed anywhere. You can also ask for a value check on an item or a proposed deal by making a post (or commenting on the current OWLs thread) on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=31">NC Mall neoboards</a>. The community is very helpful and kind, so don't be afraid to reach out!</li>
    
    <li>Anything that currently sells for 250nc or less is usually considered to be worth 1. Everything not currently for sale has a different value depending on how much people want it, and that's where Dress to Impress (DTI) tells you the OWLs value. This is why some popular items in the NC Mall may be worth hanging onto if they are only on sale for a limited time, as their value may rise after they are no longer available.</li>
    
    <li>A Gift Box Mystery Capsule (GBC) is the standard measure when we talk about "caps", meaning 1 cap = 1 GBC. Most cookies are also valued at 1, although sometimes Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies might be considered a half by some people, you just have to check to be sure.</li>
    
    <li>The easiest way to trade is to make a list of all the items that you are looking for on DTI (https://impress.openneo.net/) and make sure the list is set to "Items You Want" and "Trading". Then make another list of items that you own and would be happy to trade and make sure this is set to "Items You Own" and "Trading".</li>
    
    <li>You can then go through the items that you are looking for by clicking on them in DTI and seeing who has them listed as Up for Trade. You can click on the person's username and see their trade list. This lets you look for items you are interested in that they have available. DTI 2020 (https://impress-2020.openneo.net/) includes the OWLs values of the items with each one!</li>
    
    <li>Add up the OWLs number of the items you want from one person's list and then see if you have anything they want of roughly equal numbers (you can offer multiple items). Many people will also be interested in Gift Box Capsules which are regularly on sale in the NC Mall. These will have different names but will always end in "Gift Box Mystery Capsule". People may also be interested in trading for items like Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies, Lab Ray Cookies, NC Upcycle Cookies or NC Archive Cookies, all of which can also be bought from the NC Mall.</li>
    
    <li>When you're checking out another person's lists, Classic DTI (http://impress.openneo.net/) has a handy "Compare With Your Items" button which will hide all items on the other person's trade list and wish list except for items which you have marked as owning or wanting. This saves a lot of time! DTI 2020 (https://impress-2020.openneo.net/), on the other hand, will tell you if you have any items each person offering the item is seeking when you check the item page itself (here is an example: https://impress-2020.openneo.net/items/77195/trades/offering) and on individual lists will place any items that you have marked as wanting or owning at the beginning and place a star and the word "Match" over.</li>
    
    <li>The next step is to neomail the person! Message them to say you are interested in x items and let them know what you are offering in return. You may wish to ask the other person what they value the items at in terms of OWLs to make sure that you are on the same page, as OWLs often gives a range value such as 3 - 5 for items so you may need to have a discussion about what you both value items for. </li>
    
    <li>Another useful piece of information is to check how many people are offering an item vs how many people are seeking it. If a lot of people are offering but nobody is looking for it, you are more likely going to be able to get it in a trade and may be able to snag a good deal. If hardly anyone is offering it, then the people who do have it may be reluctant to part with it and you may struggle to get hold of it.</li>
    
    <li>Some people do not want to trade for GBCs, cookies etc. They only wish to trade items for items. Most people state this in the DTI if this is the case but don't be surprised if you are sometimes turned down for a trade if you don't have anything on someone's wishlist.</li>
    
    <li>Making an intro on DTI can be really helpful! You can do this by creating an "Items You Own" "Trading List" with no items in it, and clicking "Edit". This will allow you to write a description where you can include details such as how often you are online_  whether you are interested in GBCs and cookies, and whether you have used the "number of items" feature to record how many of each item you have/want or whether you are using it as a marker for whether an item is hard to part with, or currently may be subject to a trade. Many people use "99" as a good number to denote these kinds of things.</li>
    
    <li>Set any other lists you have to private! If you also keep track of your closet or what your pets are wearing, making sure the lists are set to private means that they won't show when people are looking at your list for potential trades and makes life much easier.</li>
    
    <li>Make sure you have your Neopets profile name listed on your DTI. You can do this at the top of your "Lists" page. This is the only way people can contact you from DTI so it is very important if you want to receive Neomail offers.</li>
    
    <li>You can also create Trading lists on Jellyneo, using the Wishlist feature (https://items.jellyneo.net/wishlists/). Fewer people use Jellyneo to find Trades but there is no harm in using this platform if you prefer and/or using both this and DTI.</li>
    
    <li>Help keep OWLs up to date! You can report your trades on the latest OWLs thread on the Neoboards so that item values are updated. Check it out and submit your Trade data today! :) <a href="//www.neopets.com/~personalvalues">here is a great guide</a> for how to figure out the values of items to let the OWLs team have your report.</li>
    
    </ul></font></td></tr><tr><th><b></b><center>GENERAL TIPS</center></th>
    </tr><tr><td><font size="2"><ul><li>In order to move NP to your side, you can complete the following steps:
    <ul><li>Send your side account an item</li>
    <li>On your side account, put the item up on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/tradingpost.phtml">Trading Post</a> and copy the link to the lot</li>
    <li>On your main account, paste the link into your browser to load the trade and then offer another item (or any number of items you wish to move to your side account) along with the number of NP you wish to move to your side acccount</li>
    <li>On your side account, accept the trade and ta da! You now have Neopoints</li></ul></li>
    
    <li>You can use NP on your side for the following activities: create and expand your gallery, complete faerie quests, adopt and trade neopets.
    </li>
    
    <li>On a side account You CANNOT buy from NPC shops, get interest from a bank account, do dailies, submit scores for games, use a lab ray cookie (unless this is your only copy of the lab map), or buy premium. You CAN have the lab map, have a gallery, join a guild, have pets, buy extra pet slots, keep whatever you win from random events, buy from the Hidden Tower IF your main account is not old enough but your side account is. These are not exhaustive lists, if you are unsure then check the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=5&amp;next=1">Help board</a> or submit a ticket to TNT. Do not take any risks with your accounts. </li>
    
    <li>You can also use your side accounts to buy NC and trade NC items, and collect free NC and NC bags from the <a href="http://ncmall.neopets.com/mall/shop.phtml?page=&amp;cat=">NC Mall</a> assuming those bags do not contain any NP prizes.</li>
    
    <li><a href="//www.neopets.com/calendar.phtml">Here is the full Neopian Calender</a> if you want to check what date a festival is coming up on. Remember that pets under level 40 can train for free at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/academy.phtml">Swashbuckling Academy</a> on their day and TNT also comes out with new colours and items related to them!</li>
    
    <li>Have you submitted a ticket to TNT and not heard back? Post your ticket number on the latest Highway to Help board located on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=5&amp;next=1">Help boards</a> to get your complaint seen and dealt with.</li>
    
    <li>Galleries have no maximum size, you can keep expanding them if you can afford it for as long as you want. If you want to delete a gallery category you have previously set up, go to <a href="//www.neopets.com/gallery/gallery_user_cats.phtml">this page</a> of your gallery.</li>
    
    <li>There is a limit to the amount of Neopoints you can have in total, on hand, in the bank and in your shop till. The limit is 2.147 billion NP. If you try and deposit into the bank when you are already at the limit, you will lose NP.</li>
    
    <li>If you struggle with impulsively withdrawing neopoints or find yourself spending too much then you can make 15 small withdrawals from your bank account. You are allowed a maximum of 15 bank withdrawals per day so if you do this, you will be unable to withdraw any more on a whim.</li>
    
    <li>Random events will occur a maximum of 8 times per day per account, not including premium events such as the space faerie showing up.</li>
    
    <li>Some random events, especially ones which take away NP, are based on percentages so the more NP you carry on hand the more you may lose. The safest thing to do is to keep NP you don't need in the bank.</li>
    
    <li>If you are aiming for any kind of daily trophy then you should know that the trophy script is run at around 1:35am NST currently, at which time the leaderboard is checked and trophies awarded. It doesn't matter where you stand on the leaderboard when you submit your score, only where you stand when the script is run.</li>
    
    <li>Whenever you get a "Nothing Happens" result on the Lab Ray, it means that you were due a colour change but the Lab selected a colour unavailable for the species you were zapping. You'll get more colour changes if you choose to zap a species with lots of colour options available!</li>
    
    <li>If you want to change your pet's gender, you can either use a Strange Potion on your pet or if you have the Lab Ray and refresh <a href="//www.neopets.com/lab2.phtml">this page</a> until you get the Lab Ray Scientist as a battledome challenger. Fight him in the Battledome with the pet whose gender you wish to change and in the first couple of hits he should change your pet's gender! You can then withdraw from the battle. You could also use a Royal Girl Kyrii/Royal Boy Kyrii Morphing Potion to morph your pet into either of those colours and also change their gender to match, or use a Witchy Negg to potentially change their gender (or turn them into a Lenny, Tuskaninny or Moehog, gain some maximum HP or intelligence or be cured of a disease... it's a random outcome).</li>
    
    <li>Do you like stats? Do you want to know all the chances of the things? Check out <a href="//www.neopets.com/~sywn">this amazing petpage!</a> Seriously I am drooling over this page. If that's not enough for you, check out <a href="//www.neopets.com/~_theswiftone_">this awesome petpage</a> for even more stats! This one covers battledome training, scratchcards, kitchen quest and more.</li>
    
    <li>Worried about how to get your account back if you ever get frozen? Take screenshots of important pages to help you remember information you may need, for example your <a href="//www.neopets.com/ncma/manage.phtml">NC Mall purchase history</a> or the first page of your <a href="//www.neopets.com/safetydeposit.phtml">safety deposit box</a>.</li>
    
    <li>Want to change your avatar to something else you've collected but don't know how? <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/preferences.phtml">Go to this page</a> and choose your new avatar from your drop down menu.</li>
    
    <li>Wonderding about Faerie Quests? They're random events that can occasionally happen as you browse the site, but if you have NC you can also buy Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies from <a href="http://ncmall.neopets.com/mall/fortune/">this section of the NC Mall</a>. They will grant you a random quest every day for 9 days. This is a great way to quickly gain stats for your Battledome pet and have a shot at getting a Fountain Faerie grant you a dip in the pool to change your Neopet's colour!</li>
    
    <li>If you get premium, then every Friday you will get access to a Space Faerie scratchcard! Check out your current premium scratchcards at <a href="//www.neopets.com/premium/sc">this page</a> to win NP, items and even a couple of Neocash wearables.</li>
    
    <li>Like adoptables? Check out <a href="//www.neopets.com/~supunu">this huge directory</a> or <a href="//www.neopets.com/~microbark">this page</a> for some Neopet adoptables :) you can also scroll through the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=13">Art Board</a> to find other adoptable pages.</li>
    
    <li>Ever heard of paperclip trades? This can be a nice way to work towards your goals. Post an item (or several) on the trading post and in the wishlist box state it is a paperclip trade. It helps if you include a line about your ultimate goal too, for example a paint brush or a petpet!</li>
    
    <li>Items with a rarity of 500 are neocash (NC) items and cannot be sold, only traded for other NC items with players or given away. You will need a Basic Gift Box (or one of the limited edition versions such as April Showers Gift Box) to send NC items to other people. Some NC items are no trade and cannot be given away! </li>
    
    <li>You can carry a maximum of 50 items in your inventory. If you want to carry more, move some to your Safety Deposit Box, open a gallery of things you like or start a shop and sell some things to make NP. You can also use the Discard button to throw away items you don't need to keep which are not worth any money - these are then deleted from the site. The donate button will send the item to the Money Tree for other players to collect - it's best not to send your rubbish there because it clogs up the tree and makes the game less fun for other people.</li>
    
    <li>Really enjoy Neopets and want to spend a bit longer doing your dailies? Maybe work out which ones are most profitable and which aren't worth doing? Keep spreadsheets to start tracking all sorts of info! You can record what you get from your dailies, what you buy when restocking and how much you sell it for, which pets you have on which accounts and what their stats and birthdays are. If you can imagine it, you can probably track it.</li>
    
    <li>If you spend at least 10,000nc in one calender month in the NC Mall then for the next month you will get access to the Future Fashions section! This section will stock many new items releasing in the NC Mall 72 hours before they are available to the general site.</li>
    
    <li>Neohomes are flash dependent and are no longer working unless you have the Ruffle extension or another Flash workaround.</li>

<li>You can trade for other people's spare Paint Brush clothing. There are some wonderful pages that can help you find spare Paint Brush clothes such as <a href="http://neopets.com/~Kyynator">this page</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/~ExtraPBClothes">this page</a>. Paint Brush clothing must be moved on a pet of that colour and species, so either send your pet of that type to the person or they will send you a pet of the appropriate type wearing the clothes. The person should be able to transfer your pet back to you the next day with the clothing on, but if you need to return their pet you borrowed, you will have to abandon the pet in the pound for them to pick up, or change its colour or species to return them, as moving a pet means it automatically takes its clothing with it.</li>
    
    <li>You cannot give your account to another person. If TNT finds out (e.g. through checking IP addresses) the account will be frozen. You can give all your items, pets etc to other people but the account must stay yours.</li>
    
    <li>You can switch accounts to use a different main account and keep your old account as a side account. It is best not to do your Dailies on either account for a couple of days either side of changing which account you intend to use for your Main account just in case, as you must not do your Dailies on more than one account.</li>
    
    <li>Something going wrong and you need to contact The Neopets Team? Go to the bottom of <a href="http://support.neopets.com/hc/en-us">this page</a> and hit Create a Ticket. Don't forget to post your ticket number on the current Highway to Help board on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=5">Help boards</a> afterwards to get your ticket dealt with asap.</li>
