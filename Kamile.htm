<br><h2>Unfair trades on the NC Mall chat board (the NCC) </h2>
<br>
It is very important to be aware that TNT does not recognize any value system for NC trading. This means that if you somehow get tricked into trading your rare and popular item for another trader's junk, and you discover this later through a value check and/or value guide, TNT will not see the trade you made as a "scam" or "mistake", and will not take action. 
<br>
There are traders who will try and make such unfair trades with new or unknowing traders, so as to gain an advantage in the NC market. What TNT is willing to do in trading situations, is reversing trades where the already agreed upon terms were not fulfilled. 
<br>
For example you agree over neomail you will trade 2 Gift Box Capsules (GBC) for one item. You send the GBCs and the other person accepts them but does not send you their item within a reasonable timeframe (do give them a day or so to get back to you; these types of scams are rare because TNT does reverse them, and real life may always interfere). Send in a ticket explaining the situation, take a screenshot of the neomails / trading board in question just in case. 
<br>
It may take TNT a while to respond: you can always edit the ticket if the person completes the trade after all.
<br><br>

<br><br><b>Some tactics dishonest traders may use:</b>
<br></font></p><ul><li><font size="2">Referring to older, outdated or unknown guides and claiming it is the "best" or most "correct". A trader may use this tactic when the outdated guide's values are advantageous to them: either it has a higher value for their items, or a lower one for your items. If you are unsure, remember you can always make a value check board, or ask other traders' opinions about a certain guide.
</font></li>
<li><font size="2">Try to convince you that they have recently seen a certain item trade for a value (much) higher or lower than it is listed for in the guide. Now, it is true that value guides cannot keep up with all the latest trends and values may fluctuate or inflate and deflate rapidly. So your trader may be honest, but if they cannot provide proof beyond their word, it is better to do a public value check (VC) to confirm the new value they are suggesting.
</font></li></ul><p><font size="2">
<br>
Note: you may not always get many responses to your VC boards, depending on the time of day and what item you are asking about. Wait for a handful of active NCC traders to confirm the value. 
<br>
Actual recent trade data (when people can tell you when and what they traded for the item you are inquiring about) is almost always more reliable than people's gut feelings or observations.

</font></p></div>

<br><h2>How to protect yourself</h2>
<br>
As a new or returning trader, it is best for you not to advertise this fact right away when you are entering NC trading. Some traders will unfortunately take advantage of any lack of information you have on items and values, and use this as an advantage to make unfair trades with you as fast as they can.
<br><br>
If you have something up for trade (UFT), whether you listed it for a certain value or not, and you get LOTS of interest in it (i.e. people jumping on your board, or multiple neomail offers on the same day), it is always a good idea to make a value check board for that particular item.
<br><br>
Consider your own wishes carefully, and try to trade this kind of (possibly seasonal) popular item, for a similarly popular item on your wishlist (WL), instead of common items that would be easy to find with your other trading fodder. 
<br>
Warning: sometimes items trend as popular for a very short time, and then trading straight away is better than waiting. But you are almost always better off taking a day or two to figure things out, especially if you are new and not yet well versed in trade values and popularity/trends.
<br><br>
Many unfair trades are proposed in private, over neomail, so other traders cannot warn you or intervene. This is not a universal truth: some honest traders prefer neomail, and with so many boards being posted daily, publicly made unfair offers have been overlooked. Usually this happens because the boards are busy, or particularly quiet, or simply because people don't have time to check / read all the boards. 
<br>
You cannot rely on a public trade always being fair and monitored by other traders. This is why taking your time to learn values and trading etiquette for a while before doing fast trades is a good idea.

<br><br>

Remember: You can say NO to any trade offer or negotiation if it is not going the way you anticipated or if you feel uncomfortable with the trade. Even if you were the one who asked/offered first, you can still back out if the other trader is not meeting your goal/value for the trade.

<div class="inside">
<br><h2>What can you do to help</h2>
<br>
The guide used by most traders is //www.neopets.com/~Waka. This is because it is the most complete, active and regularly updated guide. 
<br>
Waka has boards up frequently asking people to post the trades they have made, including what they valued the items involved in the trade. If you use the guide, I highly recommend reporting as many trades as you can. A good idea is to keep a note/doc√ºment open on your device and copying your trades into it, so you can later format them and post them all to the value boards made by Waka. 
<br>
You can neomail the guide owner(s) if you do not wish your trade information to be public, but still want to be helpful and for your data to be used. You can also neomail them with any questions you have about the values/items in the guide.
</div>

<div class="inside">
<br><h2>Some etiquette guidelines:</h2>
<br>
The neomail system tends to be buggy. If you do not get a response to a neomail offer, there could be a lot of reasons other than the person deliberately ignoring you. Aside from malfunctions that mean some neomails get accidentally deleted, or never sent at all, the system also does not give us a way of flagging mails that we want to reply to later after we have opened them. Because inbox space is limited, people may delete mails in bulk, instead of checking them all to see if we responded, especially because of lag and loading times. (Sometimes it takes me a full minute to open a mail). So if your inbox has 60-100 mails in it, it can be a daunting task to have to check them all before deleting. 
<br>
I personally recommend sending someone a second neomail after 2-3 days, if they have not responded to you. Then again, sometimes people will just not get back to you.
<br><br>
Which brings us to handling rejection. Anyone can say no to a trade anytime they want. Value is not everything in a trade. In fact, it is secondary for most trades in my experience. The first and most important thing for people is finding their particular wishes. This means that you might have to make a lot of offers before finding a trade for an item you are seeking. It is the same for everyone.
<br>
If you have little NC and not the biggest NC item trade list, it can be frustrating to find trades. Patience, lots of browsing the NCC, tradelists (TLs) on JellyNeo and Dress to Impress, and contacting traders who have your items listed as up for trade are tried and true tactics, and still the best ways of finding trades. It involves a degree of luck, and if you do not have much to offer, you will generally be seeking for longer. 
<br>
Don't let this discourage you. I have personally seen people achieve their dream items many times, even those without a lot of / any money to spend on NC. And that feeling of achievement is part of why we enjoy trading!
</div>

<div class="inside">
<br><h2>On GBCs, Populars and Custom</h2>
<br>
Instead of specific wishes and priorities, traders may be looking to trade custom, GBCs or "populars" for their items. 
<br>
GBCs are often sought after, as they are on sale only part of the month and traders need gift boxes to complete trades, and populars have a higher chance of retrading at the same or an even higher value, so they are useful currency in the quest for wishes. 
<br>
Custom is popular in itself because not everyone can purchase NC all the time, and there are always new items people want in the mall.
<br>
There is no consensus on the NCC about the added value of the number of gift boxes used in a trade, or the extra costs of what some people call "box-heavy" trades. This is because people have different trading habits and opinions. 
<br>
Many NCC traders who trade a lot and therefore use a lot of gift boxes, will value any item you use a box for as at least one cap. Others might think differently, because they trade so infrequently that the monthly boxes they receive from Trudy are sufficient, and they therefore consider the act of trading to be "free". However, people who trade frequently will have to use GBCs to get gift boxes, so each trade costs them a minimum of 100 NC (1/2 the price of a GBC), plus the value of the item sent. 
<br>
I would recommend talking to your trader about boxes and how they factor into a trade for them, especially if you are making a trade in which one of you has to use a lot more boxes than the other; for example, exchanging lots of small buyables for a high value item.
</div>

<div class="inside">
<br><h2>NC Sales</h2>
<br>
GBCs go on sale at least two times a year: every Black Friday (the Friday after the US holiday Thanksgiving) and every Spring / Easter (the exact dates vary). 
<br>
Faerie Quest Cookies (FQCs) also sell for half price once a year, during the Faerie Quest Event. The Faerie Quest event usually happens in February, but in 2018, for example, it was delayed and did not happen until April. 
<br>
Other sales include the "Weekend Sales", when three categories of wearables go on sale for half price during three consecutive weekends, usually starting in January. 
<br>
To stay up to date about sales, check the news, and make sure you browse Jellyneo and their articles on NC. This will give you information on previous year's dates and sales and events for the NC Mall.
