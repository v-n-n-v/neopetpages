<h1>An in-depth guide to the customisation spotlight </h1>

Hello and welcome to this guide about the customisation spotlight!<br>
My name is <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=martia_elior">Claire</a>  and I'll be your host today. I decided to put up this guide, together with the friends of the "Your Vote Matters!" topic, that can easily be found on the Customisation board. We learned some things about the Customisation Spotlight over the years and we thought we shared our knowledge, hoping that it can help others winning it, or at least have the best dressed pets out there!<br>If you're looking for obtaining a shiny star trophy for your pets, you're reading the right page!<br>

We tried to make the guide the most complete as possible, but please, for every <i>suggestion</i> or <i>feedback</i>, don't hesitate to neomail me. I'm always happy to listen to <b>positive opinions</b> or <b>constructive criticisms</b>. To do that, click on the sign below!<br><center><a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=martia_elior&amp;subject=Customisation+Spotlight+Guide"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/pQ0DR.png"></a></center>
<br><br><div class="box1">When you find this kind of boxes, it means that they are some miscellaneous information that you can find interesting.</div>

<div class="box2">When you find this kind of boxes, it means that there you can find some tips and random notes about the Customisation Spotlight (CS). If you're aiming for a trophy, have a look at them too!</div>


</div>

<div class="text" id="1">
<h2>The basics</h2>

Every contest begins on Monday. When you enter your pet, you enter them in the upcoming contest; if you enter them on Monday, they will be up for voting on next Monday, so seven days later. If you enter your pet on Sunday, they will be up for voting in the contest starting the day after. <br>It looks like that pets are shown by the same order in which they have been submitted, so the sooner you enter your pets, the sooner they show up while voting. We think that the voting starts again showing the first entered pets, once all the pets entered have been voted once. Otherwise, we shouldn't explain why, in the same week, two different people spot the same pet in different days.<br>
Please notice that winners are announced <b>at least</b> two weeks later than when they are entered the spotlight. Some people who won, didn't enter their account for 18-19 days, so they couldn't submit their pets to the CS during the last two weeks.
<br><br><br><div class="box2"><b>suggestion:</b> if you particularly like an outfit you created, keep it for a while - at least two weeks - before changing it; it looks like it increases the chances to win, since people can vote for it more than once.<br>
Moreover, the best time to change your pet's customisation is the weekend (Sunday especially), because they are the last voting days before the start of a new contest. ;)</div></div>

<div class="text" id="2">
<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
<b>Q: how many pets can I enter the contest every week?</b><br>A: you can enter all your pets on your main account and, if you have side accounts, you can enter them too! It was confirmed in editorial <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=378">#378</a>!<br><br><b>Q: may I vote on side accounts too?</b><br>A: TNT said no in editorial <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=344">#344</a>, but then they changed their minds, saying yes in editorial <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=384">#384</a>. It's not very clear indeed, unfortunately.<br><br><b>Q: while voting I noticed that some pets don't wear any wearable item, how is this possible?</b><br> A: the pet picture you rate while voting should show the pet's outfit when it was entered the competition, but sometimes pets are shown with their current customisation. So, for example, if you enter your lab rat, they change species during the week and you abandon them or don't customise them again, they can appear unclothed.<br><br><b>Q: does my pet image remains the same during the whole voting week?</b><br>A: that's a tricky question. Right-clicking the picture when you're voting, you can notice that sometimes you have cpn/Petname/1/2.png other times you have cp/imagecode/1/2.png. If it's a cpn image, the outfit is the actual one dressed by the pet (let's call it "dynamic"). If it's cp, it's the "static" picture of the pet when it was entered the contest. It looks like cpn/cp are totally random, apparently.
<br><br><b>Q.: may it happens to see your own pets while voting at the Customisation Spotlight?</b><br>A: TNT said in editorial <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=579">#579</a> that they set up the program so you can't come across your pets while voting. It may happen though, and we don't know why. So, give them all a 10, if you come across your own pets!<br><br><b>Q: how are winners chosen?</b><br>A: TNT said in editorial <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=719">#719</a> that there's a judge that checks over the entries (we guess among the pets which got 10 only) and chooses the best to get the award. <br><br><b>Q: what/when is the best time to enter?</b><br>A: as we said in the first section of this guide, be sure to enter every Monday for the most opportunities to be voted upon more than once. <br><br><b>Q: when on Monday?</b><br>A: There's no any better or worse time to enter during Monday. The new contest starts on 12 a.m.,so you can enter as soon as the new contest starts! <br><br><b>Q: Can I share my entry with others to gain votes like in the BC?</b><br>
A: No, there is no way of sharing your entry in order to gain ratings.<br><br><b>Q: I'd like to have a proper look at an image, because I find the voting one too small; how can I do it?</b><br>A: right-click with your mouse over the pet image and select "copy image link" from the menu that opens. Paste the address into a new browser win.dow. Look at the pasted address and change /1/2.png with /1/7.png to have the biggest option, or /1/5.png to have a medium option. Then press the enter key and you'll have a big picture!<br><br><b>Q: I'm voting for the entries and I'm stuck on a broken image. What can I do?</b><br>A: Broken images seem to be related to those pets who have a space in their name, which is very, very rare. You can copy the image link like suggested above and look at the address before pressing the enter key. If it is a cpn link, you can see their name (space=%20) and search for them on Dress To Impress, so that you can see their outfit and cast your vote. Otherwise, if it's a "static" image or you don't have the time/will to do so, just give them a 6 and go on. xD<br><br><b>Q: I found a stunning outfit and I absolutely want to know what that pet is wearing. How can I do it?</b><br>A: Just check if it's a cpn link. If you're lucky and it is, you have the petname and you can copy it on DTI to have a deep look into it!<br><br></div>
<br><div class="text" id="3">
<h2>Neopoints or Neocash?</h2>

Creating an outfit with neopoints items only is actually more difficult than helping yourself by adding some Neocash wearables. Not everyone can spend real money for pixels though, and some people live in countries where the NC Mall is not available. 
<br>
Neopoint-based outfits are more limited because many wearables are very pricey and/or only species-specific ones. There is a handful of inexpensive multispecies stuff you can work with, but it can be quite challenging to come out with a great customisation without adding some NC items in order to replace the neopoint ones that are out of the pocket range for the majority. However TNT is often working on adding new items in order to expand the choice range, so it's always better to keep an eye out for the latest news and events on the site.
<br><br><div class="box1">
<b>NOTE:</b> during May 2013, TNT released a particular Neocash cookie which allows to  donate a select number of NC items for 4 Neopian consecutive days after opening it. This is a great feature for NC mallers, because it allows them to get rid of all the unwanted items they generally receive when opening capsules, for example.  Moreover, since some the items donated appear at the <a href="/donations.phtml">Money Tree</a>, they can be grabbed by everybody, even those Neopians who can't buy neocash for one reason or another! So, if you don't have access to the NC Mall, visit the Money Tree daily, you can get something for free!</div>
<br><div class="box2">
<b>CUSTOMISATION SPOTLIGHT TIP:</b> If you are aiming for a shiny trophy for your pets, then you'll probably prefer to create a neopoints only outfit. Whether Neocash actually gives you a huge variety among the items you can choose from, it seems to be really difficult to win in this category mostly because there are tons of nice entries every week. With neopoints, creating an outstanding outfit is actually more tricky, but you have more chances to win, sooner or later.  </div>
</div>
<div class="text" id="4">
<h2>Choose your theme</h2>
Another important aspect when you're going to dress your neopet up is choosing a theme for your customisation. You can start from a specific item you fell in love with and see which pet of yours wears it the best, or decide a theme and choose which wearables fit it the best! Sometimes, instead, it just happens that TNT releases a brand-new item that you absolutely want to try out. 
Here below you can find the most popular themes you can see looking around.
<br><ul><li>season related</li>
<li>colour scheme</li>
<li>adventure related</li>
<li>spooky related</li>
<li>event related</li>
<li>neopets character related</li>
<li>book or movie character related</li>
<li>neopian land related</li>
</ul><br>
Did you decide the theme you want to work with? Great! Now you have to dig into your closet to find all the theme-related items you have. Another very helpful way is using Dress To Impress dressing tool, so you can also play with items you don't have yet and decide if you need to buy or trade for them for the outfit you're working on.<br><br>
Please, always consider to choose a theme for your outfit. Pets randomly dressed up don't look stunning! Here below you'll find a short list of pets customised with a theme. (Images taken among the pets entered in the Customisation Spotlight.)<br><br><br><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/7hvvj556/1/2.png" style="padding: 2px;"><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/4hwczfmn/1/2.png" style="padding: 2px;"><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/fnzstbzx/1/2.png" style="padding: 2px;"><br><br><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/dnmvgtw7/1/2.png" style="padding: 2px;"><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/vozhnnom/1/2.png" style="padding: 2px;"><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/lno9hvo9/1/2.png" style="padding: 2px;"><br><br></div>

<div class="text" id="5">

<h2>Not animated pictures</h2>

<div class="box2">This section of the guide is really important if you're looking for winning the CS, because people will vote your fixed image!</div>
<br>
The image you're going to see on your user lookup is a fixed one, so the animation of some Neocash items is not viewable. There are some cases where you create a very gracious outfit which looks great in your customisation window, but once you save it and go to your lookup to see it, the result is not as nice as you thought it would be. This can happen because some animated items, like showers, can be completely invisible in the fixed image (like the Starburst Shower, for example) or can be placed just in front of the pet's face (like the Autumn Leaf Shower and the Fancy Sparkles Shower). <br>
So, when you save your outfit, spend some seconds seeing how the pet looks on your user lookup!
<br><br><br><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/rrlx3ftg/1/2.png" style="padding: 2px;"><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/dn28346r/1/2.png" style="padding: 2px;"><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/tkxnjvxl/1/2.png" style="padding: 2px;"><br><br><br>
Another important aspect: it often happens that, when we want to create a mysterious atmosphere, we tend to use dark backgrounds, dark foregrounds and maybe also a fog. This can end up being so much mysterious that you can barely distinguish the pet and the scene itself, especially on fixed pictures! So, beware when using items like A Rolling Fog, Darkness Attacks, or Cover Of Darkness; especially on Shadow/Skunk/Stealthy painted pets. The outfits below are awesome, but the 150x150 pixel images don't give them justice!<br><br><br><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/7dlzo7s2/1/2.png" style="padding: 2px;"><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/6mj4x937/1/2.png" style="padding: 2px;"><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/4xj4m4jh/1/2.png" style="padding: 2px;"><br></div>
<div class="text" id="6">

<h2>Species peculiarities</h2>
<br><h3>Hair, ruff and mane</h3>
Some species have ruff/hair/mane which can cause difficulties (and frustrations!) while customising. <br>
Here's the list of those species:
<ul><li>Cybunny (ruff)</li>
<li>Eyrie (ruff)</li>
<li>Gnorbu (mane &amp; hair)</li>
<li>Krawk (hair)</li>
<li>Kyrii (hair)</li>
<li>Ogrin (ruff)</li>
<li>Peophin (hair)</li>
<li>Tonu (hair)</li>
<li>Usul (ruff)</li>
<li>Wocky (ruff)</li>
<li>Xweetok (hair &amp; ruff)</li>
<li>Yurble (mane)</li>
</ul>

In these cases, we should consider that not every wig or every dress looks good with those pets, because there are some items which make the hair/mane/ruff disappears, but this doesn't happen with every wearable. TNT recently had the wonderful idea of releasing the Be-Gone! NC items, which make disappear not only fur and hair, but also feet, mouth, eyes, and so on. Otherwise, if you want to stick to neopoint items, some species specific sets can help too.<br><br><h3>two and four legged neopets</h3>
Handheld items are worn differently by two and four legged pets. This means that, for example, a staff dressed by an Aisha can be placed so distant from the pet that it doesn't even seem to be a right-hand item, actually. Flowers are in vases for four legged pets, whether the two legged ones hold them in their paw. Purses are hung on the shoulder of four legged pets, and can hide part of the clothes they are wearing. Just consider those things while dressing four legged pets up!<br><br><br><br><br><div class="box1">
<b>interesting random fact:</b> Some species have some hat items zoned under earrings, right-hand item or other zones, so that they can wear them <i>together</i> with wigs. I don't know every item out there, unfortunately, but here are some examples:

<ul><li> Kacheek - Itchi Antennae (earrings)</li>
<li> Usul - Spring Circlet (earrings)</li>
<li> Lutari - Balthazar Ears (right hand item)</li>
</ul><br><br><center>

</div>
</div>
<div class="text" id="7">

<h2>particular painted neopets</h2>

There are some particular painted neopets which can't wear the normal clothes, so they need their <i>specific</i> wearable items (except for backgrounds and foreground stuff, of course). This actually makes dressing those Neopets up more and more difficult, especially if you'd like to make your outfit entirely NP. Here below you'll find a list of neopoint pieces of cloth which can be worn by those painted pets. The good news is that TNT started releasing clothes for these pet colours years ago, and now we have a lot of NC items among we can choose!<br><br><br><br><h3>Maraquan neopets</h3>

<br><br><br><div class="box1">
<b>Curiosity:</b> Maraquan Myncies can be dressed up like normal pets! They can both wear maraquan wearables and normal ones too. It's lovely, isn't it?

<br><br><br><h3>Unconverted neopets</h3>
Unconverted (UC) Neopets are the ones who can only wear 'scene' items. This means that you can't dress them up with hats, wigs, dresses, shoes, wings, and so on. So, which item zones can you use to customise your UCs? <br><ul><li>Background</li>
<li>Background Item</li>
<li>Foreground Item</li>
<li>Higher Foreground Item</li>
<li>Lower Foreground Item</li>
<li>Thought Bubble</li>
</ul><br>
It's quite limited, isn't it?<br>
So, in this case you might want to work with layers and use the most possible zones, without overloading the scene, though. Here below you can see some useful examples.<br><br><br><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/v424zwn8/1/2.png" style="padding: 2px;"><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/z595244r/1/2.png" style="padding: 2px;"><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/dnklnr9m/1/2.png" style="padding: 2px;"><br><br><br><br><div class="box1">All the <b>vegetable</b> Chia colours have to be treated like UCs, except for the Pea Chia who can wear the Super Pea Chia Cape. This is a neopoint item which can be bought at the Faerieland Hidden Tower for 2 millions.<br><br><center>

<br><br>
Garlic Kikos and Jubjubs, as well as Coconut Jubjubs, can be dressed up like regular pets, instead.

</div>
<br><br><div class="box1"><b>Invisible</b> painted neopets can wear clothes; they can be very fun to customise, but you CAN'T enter them in the CS, unfortunately.

<br><br><div class="box1">And what about <b>8-bit</b> neopets? They come with their removable clothes, but many of them can't be dressed up with regular wearables, except for the same zones of UCs.<br>Out of 34 paintable Neopets, the only 8-bit neopets which can be dressed in a regular way are: 
<ul><li> Chia
</li>
<li> Draik
</li>
<li> Elephante</li>
<li> Kyrii</li>
<li> Ruki</li>
