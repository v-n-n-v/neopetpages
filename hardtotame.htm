<p>
Hello and welcome to <b>The Unofficial Neopian FAQ</b>! This is a semi-comprehensive list of significant Frequently Asked Questions covering numerous topics of Neopia, including, but not limited to, ticket support, event information, and more!

</p><p> Before May 15th, 2018, the official FAQ and ticket system were hosted on Parature which subsequently closed down leaving those resources to their support address. Back then, you could have searched up the FAQ questions, but all the answers were unavailable and possibly outdated with the ongoing editorial.

</p><p>As of November 17, 2020, the <a href="//www.neopets.com/help.phtml">official FAQ</a> has returned! However, there are parts of the official FAQ that is not current with the Editorials, social media Q&amp;As, and other places of where official discussion was made. I am still working and wishing to complete this guide, but I will need your support on creating this community-sourced quick reference guide, SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME. :D

</p><p>The FAQs are divided into a general section, an other section, and the NeoBoard Topics to fit their closest related specification. The navigation can be found on the right-hand side of this petpage and as a tip, you can search terms using CTRL-F for quick convenience. We are unable to provide a concise answer to every query, but we hope this might lead you to the right direction.</p><p>

If you have any questions, suggestions, or other comments, please contact <b><a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=mikurubeam297">Chips</a></b>!

<br><p><b>▸ Is the Lab Ray worth it? </b><br>This depends on what you want from the Lab Ray. Do you want to spend ~2m for:<br>
- Lab Ray Only Exclusive Colors (Burlap, Ice, Mosaic, MSP, Robot, and Sponge)<br>
- Fluctuating Battledome Stats<br>
- The ability to change the gender of your pets on demand without additional costs<br>
- The Lab Ray Avatar<br>
- Random Species/Color changes<br><br>

If you answered yes to most of these questions, then yes, the Lab Ray might be worth it to you!</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are the risks of the Lab Ray? </b><br>
As a disclaimer, do know that there are certain risks such as:<br>
- You are not guaranteed a specific color/species zap within a short time or even a year.<br>
- There is a chance of your pet being zapped down to Level 1 with any given zap (the odds sharply decrease around Level 25+).<br>
- "Fluctuating Battledome Stats", means your pet's Defense and Level will be demolished, but your HP will skyrocket as that stat cannot be lowered by the Lab Ray.<br>
- Lab Ray zaps are practically irreversible. If you happen to zap an unconverted pet (which you honestly shouldn't), then there is a chance for TNT Support to reverse it for you, but don't make it a habit.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/laboratory.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where can I get Petpet and Regular Lab Ray Map Pieces? </b><br>
You can obtain Lab Ray Map Pieces from the following:<br>
- Buying them from other players through the Shop Wizard, Trading Post, or Auction House<br>
- Random Events<br>
- Tarla's Non-Toolbar Treasures<br>
- The Wheel of Extravagance</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is the Petpet Lab Ray worth it? </b><br>
The Petpet Lab Ray is just an additional component to the Lab Ray Map. It's not too expensive and there's an avatar from it. There are some exclusive Petpet species and colors from the Petpet Lab Ray, but do take notice of the risks of this activity.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are the consequences and risks of Petpet Lab Ray? </b><br>
This is a quick list of the consequences and risks of the Petpet Lab Ray:<br>
- Zapped Petpets are not eligible for the Petpet Protection League award.<br>
- Zapped Petpets cannot be painted.<br>
- Zapped Petpet Krawks cannot be turned into Pet Krawks.<br>
- There is a chance your Zapped Petpet (and Petpetpet) will permanently disappear.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/247_aisha_angelpuss.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where do I redeem the Secret Lab Maps? </b><br>
You can redeem your maps over at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/treasure.phtml">Neopets Treasure Hunt</a> page.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why can't I redeem the Petpet Lab Ray Map? </b><br>
You need to redeem the main Lab Map first.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I attach a petpetpet to a zapped petpet? What happens if I zap a Petpet with a petpetpet? </b><br>
Yes, you can attach a Petpetpet to a zapped Petpet although be warned if your Petpet gets a permanently disappearing zap, then the Petpetpet will also disappear with it.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/template_images/bumbluz_ppp_charge.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Does my Petpet matter if I want an exclusive Lab Ray color? </b><br>
No, it does not, because the Petpet Lab Ray does not take into consideration of what species your currently Petpet is.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ If my petpet gets zapped into an avatar petpet, will it qualify for said avatar? </b><br>
If it meets the right requirements, such as age or matching pet, then yes it will qualify for said avatar.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/433_gold_snowbunny.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I remove a zapped Petpet, but keep it's zapped form? </b><br>
No, you cannot remove a zapped petpet and have it retain its zapped form. It will revert to its original colored species when removed from your pet.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ My pet just zapped into a Pile of Soot. Is this permanent? </b><br>
No, it is not permanent and you can revert your Petpet to its original form by removing it from your Pet.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/petpetlab_soot.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are Petpet Levels good for anything? </b><br>
Petpet Levels are only really used for Petpet Battles. There's nothing else.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where can I get Transmogrification Potions? </b><br>
You can obtain Transmogrification Potions from the following:<br>
- Buying them from other players through the Shop Wizard, Trading Post, or Auction House<br>
- Random Events<br>
- Neocola Machine<br>
- Battledome (Moehog, Harry the Mutant Moehog on Mighty)<br>
- Halloween Neopian Times (Poogle)</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What's The Neolodge good for? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/neolodge.phtml">The NeoLodge</a> is used to keep your pets at Bloated status for the duration of their stay. You will be unable to feed them for the time they are there, so no need to worry about accidentally feeding your Grarrl, Jetsam, or Skeith! The NeoLodge can also be used to reset your pet's hunger satiety back down to Bloated status if you happened to eat a bit too much over at Kelp or the Golden Dubloon.</p><p>

There's no shame leaving your pets at Cockroach Towers with no Extras as there is no difference in those additional features other than a higher cost.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/neolodge_icon.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I change the language of the site? </b><br>
You can change the language of the site by going to the bottom of any page to Select Language and adjust your language preferences there. By changing the language of the site, you might notice some differences such as follows:<br>
- The site being translated to the selected language.<br>
- Being able to use/read/eat certain items you wouldn't normally be able to (only effective with various items prior 2013-2015).<br>
- Changing the rewards of the Qasalan Expellibox.<br>
- Access to different Language NeoBoards (Italian, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Dutch, and Korean NeoBoards are retired).<br>
- NC Mall not being available (Italian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, or Korean).</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> Note: In 2008 and 2015, TNT has stopped translating all their content. A number of newer items (2015-Present) might not exist for Non-English languages and exchanging/gifting items to another player might make those items disappear. You would have to ticket in to have the items returned.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do you win at Neopets? </b><br>

Quoting from <img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> Jellyneo: 

</p><div class="box">Like in real life, the world of Neopets isn't linear, doesn't have a single overarching story, and hasn't got a single "ending" point that everyone is working towards. Instead, there are many different activities to try, and you're free to choose whichever you want, and as many or few as you want. (By extension, you're also free <i>not</i> to participate in the ones that <i>don't</i> interest you. Nobody is going to penalise you for having no interest in building a gallery or designing a web page.) My advice to you as a newbie is to try out as many of them as possible and see which ones suit you. Most players find a few activities that they really enjoy and focus on those things. If you manage to achieve the goals you set yourself in your favourite areas, then you can probably claim to be "winning" at Neopets, even if there's no congratulatory message and ending credits. ;)</div>


<p>
You can strive to be the richest, create pet dreamies, collect avatars, win trophies and contests, etc. There are an abundance of activities to do on this site and picking out your goals is how you can start to aim for that sense of pride and accomplishment.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What happens when my pet's mood is low/high? </b><br>
It just changes the facial appearance of your pets and the occasional flavor text your pet gives off. Back then, if your pet's mood was extremely low, a certain Random Event (all color changing Random Events are now retired) would change that pet's color to Blue or Red.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/plu_evil_greenquiggle.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I make my pets happy / increase their mood? </b><br>
You can do any (or all) of the following:<br>
- Feed your Neopets (Happy Negg , Smiley Negg, NC Food are boosters)<br>
- Play with Toys<br>
- Use Grooming items<br>
- Play with Instruments<br>
- Ride the Roo Island Merry-Go-Round<br>
- Visit the Tiki Tours<br>
- See a Concert<br>
- Play Kacheek Seek<br>
- Play with a Chia Plushie (sharply increases happiness and rips Chia Plushie with Lupe)</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why are my pets unhappy? </b><br>
The cause of your pet's unhappiness could be for any of the following:<br>
- Nothing, mood decreases overtime<br>
- Playing with Broken Toys<br>
- Random Events<br>
- TDMBGPOP / Apple Bobbing<br>
- Being Sick / Hungry / Having No HP<br></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Does Neopets do anything special for my Birthday? </b><br>
On your Birthday, you will receive a special Birthday themed Site Theme for the day! TNT has said that this Site Theme will increase the frequency of Random Events.</p>
<div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 653 | Question 8 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=653">link</a>]<p>
<strong>Hi, TNT! *waves* I'm sure this is something that you thought you were done explaining, but unfortunately quite a few users (including myself) would like some clarification with regard to getting Random Events on your birthday. I've seen some users say that it was just an old joke on your behalf, but one gets an increased amount of RE's on their birthday, yes? Please remove my UN. Thank you. :3 ~UN removed<p></p></strong>
</p><p>The fact that you get an increased chance for Random Events on your birthday is completely true. :) It's even been carried over to the new system. So, enjoy your special day!</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I make NeoFriends? </b><br>
Making NeoFriends is a pretty difficult task! You can go around the NeoBoards, join Guilds, and whatnot to see if there's anyone that would like to be your NeoFriend.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/lobby/friends.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What does this acronym/phrase mean in Neopets? </b><br>
I would check out the following general guides for that:</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> Jellyneo's Neopian Dictionary<br>
jellyneo.net/?go=neopian_dictionary</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/pteri.gif"> TDN's The Neopian Acronyms And Terms Page<br>
thedailyneopets.com/articles/tnaatp</p><p>

As these are general guides, they might not cover specific terms in relation to the topic in mind. I would either check out if there is a acronym/phrase guide for that specific topic or ask the closest related NeoBoard for that.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why did my message get blocked? </b><br>
It's because your message tripped the filters so you gotta reword it (but only do so when the context is appropriate).</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I finally allowed to mention LGBTQIA+ related topics on Neopets? </b><br>
As of December 18th 2020, you are allowed to discuss LGBTQIA+ related topics on Neopets.</p><p> 

We suggest you read the full editorial here and keep in mind the numerous caveats that this change entails:</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 923 | Second Special Announcement [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=923">link</a>]<p>
We wanted to give you a heads up about some changes coming soon to the filters on the Neoboards. As many of you are aware, certain discussions that extend to real-life topics are not permitted on the boards, in order to ensure the safety and privacy of our users.</p><p>

However, Neopets should always be a safe place to express yourself, regardless of your identity or orientation, and many of the filters we had in place in the past did not allow for that expr.ession. Above all else, it's important to us on TNT that Neopia and the Neoboards are a safe and welcoming place for everyone, including Neopians in the LGBTQIA+ community. We've realized that some of the filters or restrictions placed on the Neoboards did not always account for that, so we'll be making changes to filters surrounding LGBTQIA+ filters and topics on the Neoboards.</p><p>

It's always been a priority for TNT to support our userbase in expressing themselves openly and safely, and we are excited to roll out these long overdue changes! In doing so, we'd like to be very clear about what we can and cannot allow to keep Neopia safe, supportive and inclusive for all our users. Please look over our new rules below, which will be added to the Chat Rules page as well. (cont.)</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ Someone sent me a Foal in Box for some reason. Why is that? </b><br>
It's because your NeoMail inbox is full. Foal in Box is play-on-words for "Full Inbox".<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/gif_foal_box.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about the basics of Neopets? </b><br>
Don't be afraid to ask questions. Everybody starts somewhere and the game has a lot of content to discover. The most important thing is to have fun along the way.</p>

<h3><a name="dailies"></a>Site Dailies Related</h3>

<p><b>▸ What is the Anchor Management and is it worth doing this? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/anchormanagement.phtml">Anchor Management</a> is a simple single button click daily for a free pirate-themed item per day. This daily started after the events of the Krawk Island Disappearance.</p><p>Anchor Management is 100% worth visiting daily as you have the chance to get some Morphing Potions, Dubloons, Paint Brushes, and other great rewards!<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neopedia/278_krawken.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Apple Bobbing and is it worth doing this? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/applebobbing.phtml">Apple Bobbing</a> is a simple single button click daily for a free apple/Haunted Woods/Neovia themed item or an unfortunate event per day. This daily started at the start of the Haunted Faire 2010 and is run by Vandebart Biggsby (or Bart)!</p><p>

These are the unfortunate events that could happen from Apple Bobbing:<br>

- You can lose Neopoints (it is also possible to have your Neopoints on hand go negative)<br>
- You lose a random item from your inventory<br>
- Your active Neopet's mood is lowered<br>
- Your active Neopet gets hurt and loses health<br>
- Your active Neopet contracts Blurred Vision<br>
- Nothing happens</p><p>

Apple Bobbing varies for some people, but we all do it at some point for the Imposter Apple Avatar. Some people quit this daily right immediately obtaining the avatar because the unlucky outcomes can be annoying, but others might continue to visit here for the free items. You decide if you're hungry for apples!<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/imposterapple.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I heard that Apple Bobbing can reward any item with the word "Apple" in it. Is that true? </b><br>
This was true, but not anymore. In early 2018, TNT updated the Apple Bobbing prize pool and accidentally made the daily give apples that were rare item codes, r99s, and even Everlasting Apple for a short time!</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Bank Interest? </b><br>
At the <a href="//www.neopets.com/bank.phtml">National Neopian Bank</a>, Bank interest is a daily dose of free NP with the click of a button. The more NP you have in the bank and higher Interest Rate you are, the more interest you'll get.</p><p>

It is basically free Neopoints per day, so it is always beneficial to you. Some people would want to get about 15k+ in Bank Interest (Ultimate Riches! + 43,797,080 NP) to set aside for buying Stock Shares at the Neopets Stock Market.</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Coltzan's Shrine and is it worth doing this? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/desert/shrine.phtml">Coltzan's Shrine</a> is a simple single button click daily for a chance of a free desert-themed item, stat boosts, or Neopoints every 13 hours. This shrine is a tribute to King Coltzan III and started being a daily in 2001 after the events of Usurper and Search for the Crown.</p><p>

You are not always guaranteed a reward, but there are no harm in visiting. Notable rewards include Dubloons, rare Battledome weapons, and more! Free healing, Neopoints, and stat boost are nice extras.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is this Sparky Random Event I got from visiting the Coltzan's Shrine? </b><br>
Sparky is a tribute to a former Neopets artist's dog (named Sparky) who passed away on August 27, 2013. Their dog was the inspiration of the Spardel petpet.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/template_images/sparky_flying.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is it true that you can get a million Neopoints for visiting the Coltzan's Shrine? </b><br>
TNT has said this was possible <a href="//www.neopets.com/help_search.phtml?help_id=298">in the past</a>, but it is believed this discontinued at some point or never happened where it now lives as a Neopets meme of members staying up until Midnight NST to do Coltzan's Shrine.
</p><div class="box"><p><strong>Is it true that Coltzans Shrine gives out 1 million Neopoints?</strong><br>
Yes, there is a small chance that Coltzan will feel really generous and give out 1 million Neopoints. This is extremely rare though, so don't count on it. (The odds are approximately 6 million to 1.)</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Council Chamber and is it worth doing this? </b><br>
The <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/council.phtml">Council Chamber</a> is a simple two-button click daily for a free Altador themed item or Neopoints. This Daily can be accessed after completing the Altador Mini-Plot.</p><p>

The Council Chamber does not have any spectacular rewards, but you are always guaranteed a cheap item reward or 200-1,000 Neopoints.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/betterthanyou/contestant254.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Daily Puzzle and is it worth doing this? </b><br>
Located under the <a href="//www.neopets.com/community/index.phtml">Community Hub</a>, The Daily Puzzle is once per day trivia game of Neopian subjects that rewards Neopoints and even items sometimes.</p><p>

The game rewards about 200-400 (average around 300) Neopoints upon answering correctly. Items are usually rewarded on Neopian holidays such as pet days. If you are unable to find or just want to find the answer quickly, you can find the answer at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=23">Games NeoBoards Chat</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=5">Help NeoBoards Chat</a>, or fansites such as Jellyneo, The Daily Neopets, and Sunnyneo.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why am I getting the same Daily Puzzle?</b><br>
Sometimes TNT will forget to update the Daily Puzzle. Same question, same answer, and same rewards. No harm.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Deadly Dice and is it worth doing this? </b><br>
The <a href="//www.neopets.com/worlds/deadlydice.phtml">Deadly Dice</a> is a game where you can gamble your active pet's Level against Count Von Roo. You can only challenge with him once per day and at anywhere 12:00am to 1:00am NST (except on Halloween when he is awake to play all day that day).</p><p>

Most people quit after getting the Count von Roo's Deadly Dice Avatar. Some people might only do it when they want to decrease their pet's Level for training. In reality, this game is not recommended for training Levels.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/deadlydice.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why didn't I get more Levels from this massive tie streak win I just got from the Deadly Dice? </b><br>
To quote Jellyneo, "You can never wager an amount of levels that would put you in the negatives if you lost.</p><p>

This is to say if your active pet is currently Level 3 and after two ties, you cannot wager to get +4 Levels as losing would drop you down to Level -1. You would get +3 Levels instead.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a way how to guarantee a win from the Deadly Dice? </b><br>
There is no guaranteed win method from the Deadly Dice. </p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Deserted Tomb and is it worth doing this? </b><br>
The <a href="//www.neopets.com/worlds/geraptiku/tomb.phtml">Deserted Tomb of Geraptiku</a> is a simple two-button click daily for a free Geraptiku/Mystery Island themed item, codestones, fading faeries, and/or Neopoints. There is the possibility of getting hurt or getting nothing at all though.</p><p>

The Deserted Tomb varies for some people, but we all do it at some point for the Geraptiku - Deserted Tomb Avatar. Some people quit this daily right immediately obtaining the avatar because the unlucky outcomes can be annoying, but others might continue to visit here for the free items.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/geraptiku_tomb.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Faerie Crossword and is it worth doing this? </b><br>
The <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/crossword/">Faerie Crossword</a> is a simple Neopian themed word puzzle game that can be played once a day. You can earn 200-600 Neopoints (depending on how fast you complete it) and your active Neopet might receive +1-3 Intelligence.</p><p>

Most people just do this for the avatar and then forget it exists. There is no harm whatsoever in the Faerie Crossword. If you are unable to find or just want to find the answers quickly, you can find the answers at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=23">Games NeoBoards Chat</a> or fansites such as Jellyneo, The Daily Neopets, and Sunnyneo.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/clicktoplay/ctp_27.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ The Faerie Crossword is under maintenance. When is it coming back?</b><br>
The Faerie Crossword is known to go under maintenance and it's all random on when it'll come back. It can be a few days or weeks. TNT usually don't give out an ETA on its fixes.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Forgotten Shore and is it worth doing this?</b><br>
Quite similar to Anchor Management, The <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/forgottenshore.phtml">Forgotten Shore</a> is a simple single button click daily for the chance of a free pirate-themed item, Neopoints, or a Treasure Chest containing other goodies. You can only access this daily once you have completed the <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/treasure.phtml?type=shore">Forgotten Shore Map</a> (which is pretty cheap under 200 NP).</p><p> 

There are days where you will receive nothing from this daily, but there is no harm in checking in each day. The price of the map is worth the unlimited access to the daily. You can also obtain the Forgotten Shore avatar which is randomly awarded.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/forgshore.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Fruit Machine and is it worth doing this? </b><br>
The <a href="//www.neopets.com/desert/fruitmachine.phtml">Fruit Machine</a> is a simple click daily for the chance of a Desert Fruit, Neopoints, and if you're lucky, Paint Brushes! You can also win a random Neopian Petpet (≤ r70), Fading Bottled Faeries, random Battle Muffins, and Strength/Level stat boosts to your active pet.</p><p>

You are not always guaranteed a reward, but there are no harm in visiting. The rewards are nice to try each day.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I got two matches in the Fruit Machine, why didn't I win anything? </b><br>
You are only given the two-match rewards if they the same fruit from the left side and center.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Didn't there used to be a trophy with the Fruit Machine? </b><br>
Indeed, there used to be a trophy for the Fruit Machine that was based on the amount of Neopoints won. It is believed that the High Score Table stopped updating during the daily's makeover in 2012.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/trophies/20_1.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/trophies/20_2.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/trophies/20_3.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Giant Jelly / Giant Omelette and is it worth doing this? </b><br>
The <a href="//www.neopets.com/jelly/link_not_found">Giant Jelly</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/prehistoric/omelette.phtml">Giant Omelette</a> are single click dailies for free food being Jelly or an Omelette. Both can be visited once per day and share quite the same similarities with no harm for visiting either.</p><p>

The Giant Jelly (if such a thing existed) does not have any major rewards. Poisonous Jelly and Glowing Jelly (with a very small chance of coloring your pet Glowing) can disease your pets.</p><p>
The Giant Omelette does have r101+ which are worthwhile to hoard (or sell) towards Charity Corner. There is also Honey Blossom Omelette which is really just a rare item at a high price. Rotten Omelette can disease your pets.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ The Giant Jelly / Giant Omelette has been eaten! When will another appear? MY PETS ARE DYING </b><br>
Randomly throughout the day, both places will run out of food and will be replenished later. The time of the replacement for both are unkown to this day.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/485_grarrl_skeith.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Grave Danger and is it worth doing this? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/gravedanger/index.phtml">Grave Danger</a> is a 3-10 hour daily that can reward a miscellaneous vartiety of items with highlights being Morphing Potions, Paint Brushes, Petpetpets, and the elusive Grave Danger Stamp. You must have a petpet attached to one of your pets and they will be temporarily absent from your pet upon entering.</p><p>

You are always guaranteed a reward (albeit it might not be a spectacular one) and there is no harm in participating in this daily despite the "chance of being cursed" description.

</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 620 | Question 2 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=620">link</a>]<p>
<strong> So, we have a new daily and it's one aimed at Petpets! That's totally awesome, but I have a question. The news for it seemed to imply that Petpets might not come back, which we've seen before (like the Petpet Lab Ray and Turmy). This is obviously a bit of a concern for Neopians who either have expensive Petpets or, like me, super old ones with no intention of ever detaching them. Is that really the case? Can you lose your Petpet going in the catacombs? Thanks for answering. ~kristykimmy<p></p></strong>
</p><p>You can rest assured that your Petpets will eventually wander back, once they've danced with Ghost Meepits, chewed on cultists' robes, or any other crazy adventure they experienced down there. :)</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ What kinds of things happen when my petpet is at Grave Danger? </b><br>
When your petpet is adventuring in Grave Danger, the following events will be in effect:</p><p>
- The petpet will temporarily poof in a cloud of smoke in its owner's userlookup.<br>
- You will be unable to remove the petpet.<br>
- You will be unable to zap the petpet.<br>
- You will be unable to transfer or abandon the petpet's owner.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/halloween/gravedanger/poof.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Grumpy Old King / Wise Old King and is it worth doing this? </b><br>
The <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/grumpyking.phtml">Grumpy Old King</a> / <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/wiseking.phtml">Wise Old King</a> are both dropdown submission-based dailies of telling wisdom or a making a good joke to impress the directed king. If you are able to impress the kings, they will reward items related to their kingdom, Neopoints (with a possible x10 multiplier), and possibly an avatar.</p><p>

The Grumpy Old King, King Skarl, can reward Meridellian foods, Neopoints, and most notably his collection of King Skarl related paraphernalia that's worth hundreds to millions of NP (although most people believe those rewards are not obtainable anymore nowadays or were actually released properly at all). You can try twice per day.</p><p>

The Wise Old King, King Hagan, can reward Brightvale Books and Scrolls with the addition of Neopoints. None of the rewards exceed over the 25k, but most of them are in the r90+ for Charity Corner. You can try once per day.</p><p>

Most people just visit each king for their avatars and then quit immediately, because of its long and monotonous effort of going through all the dropdown options just to get a cheap item and/or few NP at most times. There is a trophy for this daily to mention that is based off your given score from the kings.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Did TNT ever release Skarl Collectable Charm? </b><br>
Apparently TNT released it four times, but we have never seen this item outside aside from a <a href="//www.neopets.com/stamps.phtml?type=album&amp;page_id=21&amp;owner=hardtotame">Staff Member's Stamp Album</a>. It is believed sometime before July 2019 that TNT took out most of the new King Skarl prizes.</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ Does my response to the Grumpy Old King / Wise Old King matter? </b><br>
No, but nothing happens when you leave the whole response blank. There is a random avatar when using a specific response to King Skarl. </p>

<br><p><b>▸ What do you do if fierce Peophins has eaten too much tin of olives? </b><br>
This line actually came from the description of Blumaroo Court Jester (TCG).<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/tcg_0033_RX01.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Healing Springs and is it worth doing this? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/springs.phtml">The Healing Springs</a> is a place where you can get your pets healed, fed, or be given some goodies for free. You can also purchase those goodies from her shop. Both healing and shop purchases are limited once every 30 minutes.</p><p>

There is no harm, only heal. Well, your pets are either going to be healed, fed to Bloated status, or be given a free item. Either outcome is cool and it beats purchasing for a cure. Some people really just visit to purchase a Sticky Snowball (r100) or Icy Snowball (r95) for their high rarity in preparations for Charity Corner.</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> In 2020's Charity Corner, TNT purposely reduced the point value of Sticky Snowball to 1 CC Point.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/ncmall/collectibles/11_11/nc-collectible.jpg"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Kiko Pop and is it worth doing this? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/worlds/kiko/kpop/">Kiko Pop</a> is a carnival game of throwing a dart at a spinning board with balloons. It has three difficulties and the harder the difficulty the rarer the prize, but the harder chance to get a prize. You can only play once per day.</p><p>

You are not always guaranteed a reward, but there is no harm in doing this daily (don't forget to lower/mute your volume upon entering). There is also an avatar that can be randomly won from the Standard and Hard difficulty only.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/kikopop.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Lunar Temple and is it worth doing this? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/shenkuu/lunar/?show=puzzle">The Shenkuu Lunar Temple</a> is a once per day daily where you are examining the position of Kreludor and Neopia on an astrological map to guess the phase of the Kreludor. This daily rewards a variety of Shenkuu-related rewards and high valued goodies being the Lunar Cape and Pygui if the correct phase is chosen. If you did not choose the correct phase, then you will be rewarded a consolation prize which is mostly, if not all, junk.</p><p>

You are always guaranteed a reward (albeit it might not be a spectacular one) and there is no harm in participating. Some people don't bother to find the correct phase now and then due to its tedious process but the free junk item is appreciated. Most of the correct item rewards are in the r90s range in case you want to stockpile for Charity Corner.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Okay so for Lunar Temple, how do I find the correct moon phase? </b><br>
The correct moon phase is based on a specific number that can be found when you left click and select View Page Source. You then use CTRL + F or CMD + F the text "&amp;angleKreludor" and compare to the following chart:</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Meteor and is it worth doing this? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/moon/meteor.phtml">Meteor Crash Site 725-XZ</a> is a daily where you poke a giant meteor with a stick in hopes that it might drop a kreludan-themed reward. You can try once per hour just until you get a reward.</p><p>

The Meteor does not have any spectacular (nor worthwhile) rewards and you are not always guaranteed a reward. There is no harm in doing this daily, but do remember to select the correct dropdown option to prevent the Meteor from poofing out of existence for that hour.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/meteorcrash.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Money Tree / Second-Hand Shoppe and is it worth doing this? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/donations.phtml">The Money Tree</a> / <a href="//www.neopets.com/thriftshoppe/index.phtml">Second-Hand Shoppe</a> are donation outlets from both Neopets players and famous Neopian characters. You are only allowed to pick up 10 total items per day from these outlets and the Rubbish Dump (example: picking up 4 items from the Money Tree, 4 items from the Second-Hand Shoppe, and 2 from the Rubbish Dump will count as 10 total).</p><p>

You'll mostly find daily junk in both outlets (from both Neopets players and famous Neopian characters), but there is no harm in picking up the junk. You might possibly find some cool items from generous Neopians.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What kind of goodies are donated by famous Neopian characters? </b><br>
In the Money Tree, there are many different famous Neopian donors that donate a variety of items, Neopoints, or Neocash items. Wishing Well donations are directly from the Wishing Well and donations from Ghost are from that NP stealing Random Event.</p><p>
In the Second-Hand Shoppe, you'll find them donate r40-r70 wearables. Those famous donors being:<br>
- Hubrid<br>
- Jerdana<br>
- Koya<br>
- Lucie<br>
- Lucy<br>
- Prince Jazan<br>
- Princess Amira<br>
- Vanity</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are the Money Tree events from the World Events still happening? </b><br>
It is believed that they still are, but the timing might have been delayed. Generous NC Mall Shopper (NC Upcycle Fortune Cookie donations) and The Scamander-in-Chief event were confirmed to still be active.

<br><p><b>▸ Why can't I collect any Neopoints from the Money Tree? </b><br>
You are only allowed to collect Neopoints from the Money Tree if you have less than 20,000 NP.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/moneybag.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there some sort of indicator that I collected the max amount of donations from the Money Tree / Second-Hand Shoppe? </b><br>
If the text description of the donation being taken is centered then that's your indicator that you have reached your max for the day.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a limit on how many items/NP I can donate to the Money Tree / Second-Hand Shoppe? Can I donate anything?</b><br>
In terms of items, there is no limit and you're allowed to donate anything (some items such as Hidden Tower items and Pile of Dung, you'll need to donate through its item page directly) that isn't No-Trade! For Neopoints, you are only allowed to donate 6 NP to 5,000 NP per donation with the total amount of 50,000 NP per day.</p><p>

There are no perks to donating aside from having your UN appear in the Money Tree with your donation.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/94_gelert_tree.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Monthly Freebies and is it worth doing this? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/freebies/index.phtml">Monthly Freebies</a> is a daily where you can receive 2,000 NP and a free food item for each pet you own. The food items are low rarity and you can only visit this daily once per month.</p><p>

Monthly Freebies does not have any spectacular rewards, but there is no harm in doing this once per month daily.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Mysterious Negg Cave and is it worth doing this? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/shenkuu/neggcave/">The Mysterious Negg Cave</a> is a grid-based puzzle game where you can win Shenkuu and Negg-related rewards from solving its mystery. You can only solve the puzzle once per day and you are give a different puzzle each day.</p><p>

There is no harm in doing this daily and there are a few decent, although not extraordinary, goodies such as Ultimate Icy Negg and Red Poogle Morphing Potion. There is also an avatar that can be randomly won and also an assortment of r90 items if you are hoarding for Charity Corner to mention. If you get stuck on puzzle, I'd check out TDN's guide:</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Qasalan Expellibox and is it worth doing this? </b><br><a href="http://ncmall.neopets.com/mall/shop.phtml?page=giveaway">The Qasalan Expellibox</a> is a Plinko-styled daily that is most notable for its possibility of rewarding free Neocash! There is also the chance of receiving some junky NP item reward, Neopoints, a disease to your active pet, or nothing at all. You can try every once every 7 hours and 7 minutes.</p><p>

Despite the risk of disease, most players would still continue to visit this daily for the chance of free Neocash.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/icons/med/m-905.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸  If I land on the Neocash slot in Qasalan Expellibox, am I guaranteed the 150 NC? </b><br>
If your language is set to English, Dutch, Portuguese, German, French, or Spanish: You will be given 150 NC for landing on the Neocash slot.</p><p>

If your language is set to Italian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, or Korean: You will be given 5,000 NP for landing on the Neocash slot.</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Rubbish Dump and is it worth doing this? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/rubbishdump.phtml">The Meridell Rubbish Dump</a> is a donation outlet similar to the Money Tree / Second-Hand Shoppe although it works a bit differently. You are still tied to the 10 total item limit with the Money Tree and Second-Hand Shoppe although the items are generated from the Rubbish Dump itself. Members can refresh at the Rubbish Dump to make items appear there with their name attached that will indicate they have visited/refreshed there. For notable items that can appear, rare r101 exclusive items such as Apple Core and Old Paper, and also r99 Medieval Petpets being Mortog and Turmac that can be found here.</p><p>

There is no harm in doing obtaining items from the Rubbish Dump although it is very, very unlikely you will ever see an item that is worthwhile. There is an avatar that can be obtained from the Rubbish Dump although it is very, very rare to get.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is the That's Not Rubbish avatar active? </b><br>
The avatar is active, but the refreshing requirements and absurd rarity of an avatar rewarding item makes it extremely difficult to obtain.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/thatsnotrubbish.gif"></p>


<br><p><b>▸ What is the Symol Hole and is it worth doing this? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/symolhole.phtml">The Mysterious Symol Hole</a> is an activity where players can get their active pet's petpets to go jump a Symol Hole in hopes of goodies. You can visit the Symol Hole repeatedly (not refreshing) until you are rewarded a prize (one prize per day).</p><p>

Most people stop visiting this activity once they get the Symol avatar. In general, it is very, very tedious to get a reward from it. There are a few items that are worth hundreds to millions of Neopoints to mention if you do wish to do this monotonous daily.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/symol.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I thought the Symol Hole was once per hour? </b><br>
It was assumed to be once per hour back then, but there's no actual time limit to try for a reward.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why wouldn't refreshing the Symol Hole work for a reward? </b><br>
You'll need to create a new URL string with each page entry. So, I'd go back to the previous page and submit any action again.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Does my action matter in the Symol Hole? </b><br>
No, you can visit the Symol hole with any action.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/backgrounds/sketch/150_symol.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Tarla's Non-Toolbar Treasures? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/freebies/tarlastoolbar.phtml">Tarla's Non-Toolbar Treasures</a> is a bit an old freebie link where on certain days and certain times, Tarla will appear in that link to give a way a free item. If it a Tarla day, there will be four different opportunities with each in different time intervals. You can only claim one prize per day. There are two different types of rewards she can give where we call them the Main and the Not-Main where sometimes the Main rewards can be Paint Brushes, Neggs, Map Pieces, and other fun goodies! The Not-Main is a random prize from a specified pool with a variety of goodies that are in the r80s, r90s, and r180s.</p><p>

You are always guaranteed a reward (albeit it might not be a spectacular one) if you happen to catch her.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I catch and/or track Tarla's Non-Toolbar Treasures?</b><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Greegs#catch">/~Greegs</a> has a detailed explanation on how to track down Tarla's Non-Toolbar Treasures.</p><p>

Also, usually there are a couple people that track her in <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=7">Site Events Chat</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=23">Games Chat</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=4">Newbies Chat</a>, and <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=30">Charter Chat</a> (Premium Only).<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neopedia/245_tarla.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How would I know if it's not going to be a Tarla Day? </b><br>
She will not be available for the day if you get the description: "Tarla is busy with her other chores today. Check back tomorrow to see if she's back.</p><p>

She will be available for the day if you get the description: "Tarla is at the prize warehouse right now. Check back later to see if she's here!</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I still download the Neopets Toolbar? Is it still updated? </b><br>
No and also no.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is The Discarded Magical Blue Grundo Plushie of Prosperity and is it worth doing this? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tdmbgpop.phtml">The Discarded Magical Blue Grundo Plushie of Prosperity</a> (or TDMBGPOP) is a simple single button click daily for a various events. You can visit once per day.</p><p>

The following outcomes are:<br>

- Nothing happens.<br>
- Your active pet's hunger decreases by one stage.<br>
- Your active pet's hunger increases by one stage.<br>

- You are given 50 to 5,000 NP.<br>
- You are given a random toy, rarity 89 and below.<br>
- You are given an exclusive plushie.</p><p>

You are not always guaranteed a reward and the daily might negatively affect your pet (albeit the effects are easily recoverable if it happened). Aside from the randomly awarded Grundo - Discarded Plushie avatar, Most people would still continue to visit TDMBGPOP for its possible rewards of Trick-or-Treat Bags, Birthday Bags, Usukicon Bags, and, indirectly, other Toys that might be requested by Dark Faerie Quests.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/tdmbgpop.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Tombola and is it worth doing this? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/island/tombola.phtml">Tiki Tack Tombola</a> is a simple single button click daily for the possibility of free Codestones, Gross Food, and Mystery Island-themed prizes. How the game works is that you pull a ticket ending with a 0, 2, or 5 then you win 1-2 items with some Neopoints! There are 21 different cards and you have about a 20% chance to win! Occasionally if you get a losing ticket, the Tiki Tack Man will give out a consolation prize and sometimes Neopoints along with or without that prize.</p><p>

You are not always guaranteed a reward, but there are no harm in visiting. The most notable prizes are the Codestones, items commonly requested for Aboard The Coincidence, and the few consolation rewards are worth quite a bit.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/icons/med/m-250.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Um, Tiki Tack Tombola is asking me for donations to reopen... Do I get anything for donating?</b><br>
Occasionally, the Tiki Tack Man will run out of funds and will need donations to bring the daily back up. The daily will be back up once the funds have been raised. Other than that, there are no personal perks to donating so you can check back later once other players have donated their NP.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Tombola's hours of operation? </b><br></p><center>
<table width="400" border="1"><tr><td><center><strong>TOMBOLA IS ALWAYS CLOSED DURING</strong></center></td></tr><tr><td><center>3 AM - 4 AM NST </center></td></tr><tr><td><center>1 PM - 2 PM NST</center></td></tr><tr><td><center>9 PM - 12 AM (Midnight) NST</center></td></tr></table></center>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Tombola Coins for? How do I get them? </b><br>
A long time ago, Tombola Coins were used to play Tiki Tack Tombola but with the game being free, they are really just collector's items nowadays. They are retired and only obtainable by purchasing from other players.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Trudy's Surprise and is it worth doing this?</b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/trudys_surprise.phtml">Trudy's Surprise Slot Machine</a> (or just Trudy) is a simple single button click daily for free Neopoints, exclusive items, and sometimes Basic Gift Boxes just for coming to Neopets. The amount of Neopoints rewarded increases with every consecutive visit and on your 25th consecutive visit, you will get 100,000 NP and reset back as if it was your first day of spinning. Exclusive items are rewarded every 7th consecutive visit. The Basic Gift Boxes are randomly rewarded.</p><p>

There is no harm in doing this daily and it is really considered one of the best dailies on the site in terms of making Neopoints and getting Basic Gift Boxes for free. Basic Gift Boxes are used for gifting and trading Neocash items (the basic gift boxes themselves cannot be sent away). There is also an avatar that can be rewarded when you have redeemed your 25th consecutive spin.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/boo_defender_mynci.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bak_illusen_frostedcupcake.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/toy_altador_sunyoyo.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/gif_usul_present.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/gro_mynci_hairgel.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I just got another notification to spin Trudy's Surprise when I already did, why is that? </b><br>
Sometimes when Neopets lags a whole bunch, it'll send out multiple notifications again. Nothing bad is going on and you can just simply delete the notification.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a certain time frame where Trudy's Surprise's weekly rewards changes prize pools? Will we ever see old prize pools return?</b><br>
There is no set time when Trudy's Surprise's weekly rewards update. TNT has never rereleased any of the older prize pool items, although there is a possibility for their return.

</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 841 | Question 4 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=841">link</a>]<p>
<strong> Are the new Trudy's Surprise weekly prizes retired now? They seem to have been replaced with Terror Mountain and Snowman-themed items. If so, can we expect more new prizes to be added in the future?~~ummagine3284 <p></p></strong>
</p><p>You can expect the Trudy's Surprise prize pool to be updated on a regular basis. Whether you will ever see the first set of prizes again is something we can't say for sure yet - perhaps if they become rare and valuable at some point, the slot machine may begin awarding them once more.</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ The notification of Trudy's Surprise is annoying. Is there a way I can disable it? </b><br>
You can go to Site Preferences and disable/reactivate the notification there. At this moment, we are unsure if this will still allow you to spin or reset your spin streak.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Turmaculus and is it worth doing this? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/turmaculus.phtml">The Turmaculus</a> is a daily where your active pet's petpet can try to wake up this LORGE Turmac. He is only awake for one hour per day and you can only try once per day. If you succeed in waking up the Turmaculus, you can be rewarded with Meridellian and Turmaculus themed rewards, Neopoints, +1 STR boost to your active Neopet, full heals your active Neopets, or raises your active pet's petpet's Level by 1. Although, do know there is a risk of having your active's petpet eaten when visiting him in his waking hour.</p><p>

Visiting the Turmaculus varies for some people and always guaranteed a reward. Most of us would visit the daily for the Turmaculus Avatar. Some people quit this daily right immediately obtaining the avatar because of the chance of the Turmaculus eating your petpet while some people still visit for the item rewards and stat boost to your pet.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/turmaculus.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How will we know when the Turmaculus can be awoken? </b><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Brownhownd">/~Brownhownd</a> tracks down the times the Turmaculus can be awoken.

<br><p><b>▸ Once a petpet is eaten by the Turmaculus, is it permanently gone?</b><br>
Yup, so choose your petpet wisely upon waking him up.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/icons/screenshots/1118/4.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Does my action matter with the Turmaculus?</b><br>
No, you can try waking him up with any action.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Ye Olde Fishing Vortex and is it worth doing this? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/water/fishing.phtml">The Ye Olde Fishing Vortex</a> is a daily where you can go fishing with your pets. Each one of your pets can go fishing every 12 hours and build up their Fishing Level. Your pet's Fishing Level will determine which items your pet can get. There are a variety of exclusive goodies such as Food, Toys, Books, Stat Increasers, Potions that can fiddle with your pet's species/color, and more! There are also non-exclusive rewards such as Transmogrification Potions and Paint Brushes.</p><p>

Most of the time you'll receive junk, but there is no harm in participating in this daily. Most players don't really bother switching between pets to go fishing, but that's really a personal preference. There is also an avatar when your pet catches a Titanic Giant Squid (Fishing Level 80).<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/fishsquid.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I lend/trade a pet with a high Fishing Level? </b><br>
You can, but Fishing Level is tied to your account and will drop down to Level 0 when abandoned/transferred. It will reinstated back to its original Fishing Level when it is returned to the prior account it leveled up on.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Aside from regularly fishing, is there a way I can raise my Fishing Level? What is the highest Fishing Level?</b><br>
You can read the book, Fishing Made Easy, to raise your pet's Fishing Level. The highest Fishing Level is 500.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/boo_fishing_easy.gif"></p>

<h3><a name="sides"></a>Side Accounts Related</h3>

<p><b>▸ How many accounts can I have in total? </b><br>
Five (5) in total. You are allowed one (1) main account and four (4) side accounts.</p><p>- Neopets Editorial - Issue 700 | Question 6 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=700">link</a>]

</p><br><p><b>▸ What's the difference between a main account and a side account? </b><br>
A main account is where you do all your main account business per se:<br>
- Earn Neopoints/Neopoint Items through Games, Restocking/Selling, Dailies, Battledome, etc.<br>
- Participate in Events and most Contests/Spotlights<br>
- Obtain all the avatars<br>
- Purchase Premium</p><p>

A side account is where you can hold more pets, make more galleries/Neohomes, casually chat on the NeoBoards with, and tons of other fun things to do. There are quite a ton of limitations to what you can do on your side account, but it's an optional decision if you feel like you want to have one or not.

</p><br><p><b>▸ Why should I create a side account and what can I do on side accounts? </b><br>
The main reason why people create side accounts is to store and have more pets, but here's a quick list:<br>
- More pets and petpages<br>
- More Galleries/Neohomes<br>
- Purchase Neocash and participate in most NC events (and collecting NC Mall Freebies)<br>
- Join a Guild or make a Guild Account<br>
- Use as a main when your actual main account is silenced/frozen (this does <strong>NOT</strong> mean that you can use your side to continue to discuss what got your main account the silence or suspension in the first place)</p><p>

It is completely optional to have a side account, but do keep in mind of the rules if you plan on making one.

</p><br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to make sales off my side accounts? </b><br>
You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to bid on auctions or trades on your side account for any purpose if those auctions or trades are not your own. That includes creating sales transactions through the trading post, auctions, and official (and user) shops. Also, do make sure to take out all the items from the side's shop if you're moving accounts.</p><p>Guild Account Shops are <strong>OK</strong> as long as the shop is owned bt the Guild Leader (no account sharing), properly labeled as a Guild Account, and all funds go to Guild purposes.

</p><br><p><b>▸ I want to make my side account be my new main account. What would I have to do? </b><br>
There isn't any set procedure on switching accounts, but it's a bit of serious decision. Few questions to ask yourself:
<br>- Do you like the name of the account?
<br>- Do you care about the account age perks (Pet Transfers, Food Club, etc.)?
<br>- Is it worth the time switching over (Neofriends, NC/NP Items, etc.)?

</p><p>If you do plan to make the switch, here are a couple of things you'd want to do:<br>
- Empty your Usershop (and Shop Till), Trading Post, Auctions, Stocks, and Gallery if they indicate sales<br>
- Avoid doing dailies and anything that could earn you items/NP for like 24 hours<br>
- Cancel Premium if you have it on your old main/now side account<br>
- Add a label to your accounts indicating that this was an old main/now side account of X account (not guaranteed)<br>
- Change the Site Theme of your sides as a safety measurement to know which account you're on

</p><br><p><b>▸ HELP! I ACCIDENTALLY DID SOMETHING I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE ON A SIDE! </b><br>
Accidents can happen and most of the time, they're okay! TNT knows what's a mistake and not, so don't make frequent mistakes into a habit. If you accidently played a Flash Game or did a daily, then just donate/discard the given Neopoints and items to be safe.

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Advent Calendar? </b><br>
It's a month-long Neopets tradition of giving Neopians some prizes along with short themed animations daily. For each day of the Month of Celebration, animations contain characters and events from last year or new, random animations, along with Neopoints and prizes related to the animations. It has been going on since 2000.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/hh_news_image.jpg"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why won't the Advent Calendar load? </b><br>
If you're trying to watch old animations, all of them from 2000 to 2016 were Flash based, so you might need to use a browser that enables Flash. As for the current animations, you might have already seen today's one, or maybe it's just broken for everybody. If you are unable to access the main Advent Calendar page, you can visit the <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/process_adventcalendar.phtml">process page</a> to obtain the prizes for the day. </p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> Jellyneo's Advent Calendar Articles <br>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I get the Advent Calendar Site Theme and Avatar? </b><br>
The Plastic Fir avatar is rewarded to players every 1st day of Celebration when visiting the Advent Calendar for the first time. The Seasonal Attack Pea avatar is rewarded to players on a random day when visiting the Advent Calendar. The date of Seasonal Attack Pea avatar is the same for everyone, but is different each year. Now, the Winter Holiday theme is awarded to those who collect every single daily prize, and will be awarded at the 31st.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/plasticfir.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/attack_pea.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to participate in the Advent Calendar on my side accounts? </b><br>
No, you are not. You're also not allowed to get the avatar or the Winter Holiday theme on your side.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is with Pant Devil always stealing a Rod of Supernova in the Advent Calendar? </b><br>
It's one of the running gags in the Advent Calendar. Every year, you will get a Rod of Supernova, but the Pant Devil will swoop in and immediately steal it from you. The Unfortunate Holiday Ogrin is another Advent Calender running gag where on every December 28th (Ogrin Day), this Ogrin undergoes a series of unfortunate events.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are there any cool things around December? </b><br>
Every December, the Winter Starlight Celebration begins to celebrate the Winter season! During the celebration, the Advent Calendar will be opened for visitors, the Holiday Dream Neopet Giveaway will appear, and the Snowager will be hibernating. Neopians will be able to steal one item from the Snowager for each day of the month.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/475_winter_happyvalley.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is it true that you cannot to obtain the Snowager avatar during the Winter Starlight Celebration? </b><br>
As the Snowager will never blast you, it is true that you will not be able to obtain the avatar in December.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Holiday Dream Neopet Giveaway? </b><br>
The Holiday Dream Neopet Giveaway is a site-wide giveaway where players can enter in hopes of their pet to be changed into any Converted colored species of their liking (including the exclusive Ice Bori). There will 40 winners from a random draw and winners be announced in the New Features on Christmas day.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/boo_winter_is_here.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to participate in the Dream Pet Giveaway on my side account? </b><br>
You are allowed to participate in the Dream Pet Giveaway on your side account, but you are only allowed to participate on one account.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Charity Corner? </b><br>
Hosted by Granny Hopbobbin, Charity Corner is a semi-chaotic annual/biannual event where players are asked to donate their items for a specified cause in hopes of rewards such as item prizes, an avatar, and more. The event is based off a point system and it lasts for about a week where many players will be scouring the site in order to find as many items to donate as they can. At the end of the event, players can receive a site trophy, Neopoints, Neocash, and sometimes additional item prizes based off the amount of donations they made in the event.</p><p>

In the past, this event has given out different rewards:<br>
- Item rewards within the same rarity of the items donated (i.e. Five r90-r99 for one random r90-r99 item)<br>
- Exclusive item rewards redeemed with points via a prize shop<br>
- Site perks redeemed with points that can grant increased inventory size, reduced game avatar scores, etc.</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> Jellyneo's Charity Corner Articles <br>

<br><p><b>▸ What are the best items to stock up for Charity Corner? </b><br>
The best items to donate are cheap higher rarity items in the r90-r97, r98-r100, and r102-r179 range. Items below r80, r80-r89, and r101 are okay to stock up on, but for some players, purchasing those en masse might be extremely monotonous.</p><p>

Most players would stop at a total CC Point amount of 10,001 (not 10,000) for that is the minimum amount needed for the highest tier Site Trophy.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/toy_maraquan_plushie11.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bvs_darknova.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/blueshorthair.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ When is Charity Corner usually held? </b><br>
Charity Corner is usually done on an annual/biannual seasonal basis. If the last event was in the Autumn season, the next one would be done around the Winter season. This is not always true and TNT sometimes gives a heads up a week or two in advance.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I hear people talking about going for the Rubbish avatar during Charity Corner. What's up with that? </b><br>
The Rubbish avatar (not Rubbish Dump / That's Not Rubbish avatar) is based off the amount of items discarded throughout an account's lifetime, and since Granny Hopbobbin actually discards all your items, all those donations are counted towards the avatar.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bg_rubbishdump.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Altador Cup? </b><br>
The Altador Cup is Neopets's version of the Olympics except it happens once a year in the Summer and lasts about a month. 18 lands across Neopia compete with each other over who's the best in Yooyuball, Slushie Slinger, Make Some Noise, and Shootout Showdown.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/events/altadorcup_2012.jpg"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ When is the Altador Cup usually? </b><br>
The Altador Cup usually happens around July. A reminder message usually appears a week before sign-ups start as a reminder for players to redeem their remaining points from last year's prize shop. When sign-ups are over, they're over for the year.</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> Jellyneo's Altador Cup Articles <br>

<br><p><b>▸ How do Prize Points work in the Altador Cup? </b><br>
The Prize Points you get at the end are equal to your Altador Cup rank points, which are based on the amount of qualifying game scores you send during the event. Assuming you don't accidentally send any scores below the requirement, you can usually easily calculate the number of points you'll get by looking at the number of each of the 4 games you've played during that Altador Cup season. The most recent absolute minimum required game score is: 

</p><center>
<table width="500" border="1"><tr><td><strong><center>Games</center></strong></td>

</tr></table></center><p></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Do I get a new Altador Cup team avatar by joining a different team the next year? </b><br>
Well yes, but actually no. You do get a new Altador Cup team avatar, but you also lose your previous one if you had one prior. This is to promote fairness to those who remain loyal to a certain team.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Does it matter which Altador Cup team I pick? </b><br>
No, the only final feature that changes is your trophy appearance, depending on how well that team performed that season.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/altador/altadorcup/2009/news_image/ac9_krawkisland.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Does it matter if I submit the absolute minimum required score? </b><br>
While it has not been concretely proven, it does affect your team's overall score, so you'll see some Neopians give a bit more effort in the games to support their teams.</p><p> 

If you value your sanity, submitting the minimum required score is completely fine if you just want the prize points and cooler trophies.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to play multiple Altador Cup game tabs to save time? </b><br>
No, you are not allowed to play on multiple game tabs as that is a freezable offense.</p><p>- Neopets Editorial - Issue 786 | Question 2 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=786">link</a>] (You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to play multiple Flash Games on multiple tabs/browsers/etc.)</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is All-Star and what is the most efficient way to get it? </b><br>
All-Star is the final shield rank you can earn in the Altador Cup. This can be achieved by submitting a monumental amount of qualifying game scores throughout the event. You can click the button next in the Your Stats section of the Altador Cup Home page to check your progress to the next rank.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/altador/altadorcup/2016/popups/rank/gold_bluegem.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Break/Bye Days? </b><br>
Break/Bye Days are days in the event where players cannot earn points towards their rank and relax for the time being. This is for TNT to organize the next round and you will always face the Practice Team on these days. </p>

<br><p><b>▸ What does it mean when people on the NeoBoards say to "Lock the Brackets?" </b><br>
It's not something you have to worry about if you're just playing for prize points and the trophy, as the controversy surrounding the tournament brackets is only relevant to those who are invested in the results and the inner workings of the tournament. Altador Cup is split into two rounds, the first being held in a Round Robin tournament format. Depending on each team's performance in the first round, they are then sorted into a high, mid, and low-tier bracket for the second round where they subsequently face off against every other team in their bracket.</p><p>

In past incarnations of this tournament format, TNT allowed teams to rise or fall into a higher or lower bracket depending on their performance in the second round, which many feel invalidates the results of the first round. It also incentivizes stronger teams to purposely place in a lower bracket so they can easily defeat the weaker teams in the second round and rise into the top bracket/onto the podium with their strong showing and without much effort while all of the initial top bracket struggle against each other. Hence, the term "Lock the Brackets" is repeated by many in hopes that TNT will remove the mechanic of teams changing tiers in the second round.</p><p>

As of the 2020 Altador Cup, TNT has finally acknowledged the issue and locked the brackets, and this change is expected to apply to future tournaments.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/boo_altcp_techosguideforaltcup.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the TNT Staff Tournament and how does it work? </b><br>
The TNT Staff Tournament is an optional side activity to the main Altador Cup event. Players can create their dream TNT Altador Cup team and see who will be the best of them all. There are four rounds, another side game of "who will be the Star Player?", and a prize shop at the end. <br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/altador/altadorcup/2017/staff/players/lawyerbot.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is a Star Player? </b><br>
A Star Player is the most notable TNT Staff member in the round. If you guess the Star Player correctly, then you'll win an item award that may or may not be in the prize shop. It's rigged and TNT can select anyone they want for any arbitrary reason to be the Star Player.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is it worth investing in the Star Player rewards? </b><br>
There is a gamble, since the item might or might not be in the prize shop at the end, but the prizes for correctly predicting the Star Player are usually if not all just collectors items with little to no actual usage.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Daily Dare? </b><br>
The Daily Dare is an annual event where sibling rivals, AAA and Abigail, and occasionally some nerd, Chadley, challenge Neopians in some Flash Game fun! Neopians are given a Flash Game score to beat and are awarded with items (and occasionally stat boosts) for winning. AAA and Chadley are the more difficult challengers to face while Abigail has the lower score, and you have to pick either of them to challenge for the day. If you choose the harder score, make sure you are able to beat it as you cannot change your challenger after making your selection, so think carefully.</p><p>

This event can award avatars, a Site Event trophy, and a site theme, on top of exclusive prizes for beating your chosen challenger every day!<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/events/dd_2011_current_event.jpg"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Games Master Challenge? </b><br>
The Games Master Challenge is kinda like a diet version of the Daily Dare. The event lasts for about a week and the date of the event is sporatic, being either in the Springtime or Autumn. In terms of mechanics, AAA and Abigail have set up a themed showdown between two opposing forces (Brains vs Brawn, Pirates vs Ninja, Fire vs Ice, etc.) where Neopians can choose a side to help claim victory at the end. The item prizes, qualified game listing, and rules are the same for both sides. The sign-up reward, game challenges, and trophy appearance are different.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/events/gmc_2012.jpg"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I get the Daily Dare Site Theme? </b><br>
In order to obtain the Daily Dare Site Theme, you need to participate in the Daily Dare.

<br><p><b>▸ What is the difference between a gold and green checkmark in DD/GMC? </b><br>
A gold checkmark indicates that you completed the challenge on the day of release while the green checkmark indicates that you completed the challenge after the day of release. It is encouraged that you complete the challenges on the day of release for additional awards, but it is not necessary with regards to your trophy placement.</p><p>

For the Games Master Challenge, there is also an additional final prize for getting full gold checkmarks throughout the event. The additional final prize is usually a wearable and/or collectible item.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/gmc/2017/icons/icon_complete.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I still eligible for the final rewards if I miss a gold checkmark in the Daily Dare/Games Master Challenge? </b><br>
You will still get some prizes and your trophy even if you miss a gold checkmark, but you will need to complete the challenge(s) on each release day in order to get the best possible prize (it's usually a valuable collectible item).</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Would my game score still count if I already submitted the maximum of three scores per day? </b><br>
Unfortunately, no. If you happen to submit the maximum of three scores per day, but fail to beat the given score, then you will have to try the next day after your score submissions reset (which excludes you from getting a gold checkmark for that day).</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is a Double Dare?</b><br>
A Double Dare is a feature in the Daily Dare where if you beat AAA/Chadley's score, you'll get Abigail's awards as well.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/aaa/dailydare/2012/badges/double-dare.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is a Team Challenge?</b><br>
On some days for a limited amount of time, you (and a partner) are given the opprotunity to participate in a Team Challenge! Team Challenges are an optional feature in the Daily Dare where you and another Neopian pair up and see if you can both beat AAA/Chadley or Abigail's score for an additional award! You are not required to participate in the Team Challenge if you do not wish to rely on another Neopian sending in their score (and possibly terminating your checkmark streak if they fail to do so).</p><p>

Also, it is good etiquette to have the score ready to send before accepting/creating an invite.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/aaa/dailydare/2012/badges/team-challenge-sml.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where am I supposed to find a partner for the Team Challenge? I don't have any Neofriends.</b><br>
You can find a partner for the Team Challenge over at the Games NeoBoard Chat, Site Events NeoBoard Chat, or Help NeoBoard Chat. It is advised that you check the last post to see who still needs a partner for the event.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Festival of Neggs? </b><br>
The Festival of Neggs is an annual event where Neopians can participate in some Easter Negg Hunting! The event is usually hosted by Kari, the Negg Faerie, or Topsi (and sometimes with additional assistance). They will provide hints for finding a Negg hidden on one of the site pages every day, and players can receive Negg themed prizes such as food, wearables, books, stamps, etc. and a Site Theme! The event is usually live during the Springtime for about two weeks.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/events/fon_hfc81y.jpg"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where can I find the locations of the hidden Neggs? </b><br>
The Site Events NeoBoard Chat and Help NeoBoard Chat will usually have a dedicated thread with the locations. You can also check out official fansites such as Jellyneo, The Daily Neopets, and Sunnyneo for the answer as well.</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> Jellyneo's Festival of Neggs Articles <br>

<br><p><b>▸ I'm at the location of the hidden Negg, but the Random Event isn't showing? </b><br>
Make sure you visit the Festival of Neggs hub first to register in the event, and that you double-checked that the place is correct on a fansites such as Jellyneo, The Daily Neopets, and Sunnyneo. If you are still unable to locate the hidden Negg, then send in a ticket to the <a href="//www.neopets.com/help.phtml">official FAQ</a> for technical support. Note that some days have two possible Negg locations, so if you can't find it at the same place someone else did, your Negg is probably at the other location.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/boo_fony14_negg_lastyear.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I get the Festival of Neggs Site Theme? </b><br>
In order to get the Festival of Neggs Site Theme, you need to find one hidden Negg. It doesn't have to be on the day of release.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Do we get to choose which Neggs/Prizes we want? Is it really just 5 Neggs and 15 prizes total?</b><br>
Yes, every FoN usually has 5 predetermined Specialty Neggs with 3 themed items per Negg. You'll be prompted with a random set of 3 of those Specialty Neggs and get to choose 1, which determines which themed item pool your prize will be from. The item you receive is random from the themed pool.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/435_kari_neggfaerie.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the difference between a gold and green checkmark in the FoN? </b><br>
A gold check mark indicates that you found the hidden Negg on the day of release while a green checkmark indicates that you found your Negg after the day of release. If you are able to collect every hidden Negg with a gold checkmark, then you'll get the final reward (it's usually a collectible item).</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Do I have to find the hidden Negg on the release day? </b><br>
If you want the final award, then yes, you have to find every hidden Negg on each release day. The first day of the event usually lasts for a day and a half.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I still eligible for the final reward if I miss a gold checkmark in the FoN? </b><br>
Nope, they're pretty strict with the gold checkmarks for the final reward.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_negg_snowager.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Faerie Festival? Is there anything interesting that happens on this date?</b><br>
On September 20th, all the Faeries of Neopia gather in Faerieland to party in the Faerie Festival. All offical Faerieland Shops are 50% off (the Hidden Tower is excluded) and the Healing Springs will always fully heal your Neopets. There was a week-long event in 2017 one time with a mini-game, Wing-It, and an NC portion added.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nnmail/09_09/site_event.jpg"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are there any other holidays similar to the Faerie Festival? </b><br>
Yes there are other special event days for certain lands and shops.</p><p>

Usuki Day - Double stocks + 66.6% off all Usukiland items<br>

<br><p><b>▸ Will we ever see Wing-It again? </b><br>
In an old Editorial, TNT has stated that it was a possibility that they will bring the game, Wing-It, back again in the future.</p><p>- Neopets Editorial - Issue 803 | Question 4 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=803">link</a>] (General Info)</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I though Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies would be discounted during Faerie Festival. Why are they not?</b><br>
Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies are only discounted during the Faerie Quest Event, and not during the Faerie Festival on September 20th.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/nt_images/636_faerie_quests.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What and when is the Faerie Quest Event then?</b><br>
The Faerie Quest Event is a yearly event where the Faeries gather around and dedicate their efforts to repair Faerieland in some way. You get a one free Faerie Quest per day for visiting the quest homepage. You also get a Faerie themed prize for visiting each day, and there's usually a bonus prize for visiting each day.</p><p>

The event usually happens around the Springtime.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/2015fq_news_image_223_blurb.jpg"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ During the Faerie Quest Event, if I have an active Faerie Quest Fortune Cookie, which quest do I do first?</b><br>
As of 2019's Faerie Quest Event, it does <strong>NOT</strong> matter which quest you accept first. Prior to 2019, you'd want to accept the cookie quest first, and then the event quest to prevent the event quest from overriding the cookie quest.</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> Jellyneo's Faerie Quest Event Articles <br>

<p><b>▸ How do you submit a story/comic/article to the Neopian Times? </b><br>
You can enter over <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/nt_submit.phtml">here</a>! You will be shown a list of possible submission sections (article, comic, stories) to choose, each with its own set of rules.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/spotlight/hub/icons/neopiantimes.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are there any rewards for being published in the Neopian Times? </b><br>
Yes! You get a trophy for your publication, with a number below it indicating how many times you have been published before (e.g. 3x CHAMPION meaning you got published three times). You can also get an avatar by reaching certain milestones: as of now, you can get one for being published 10 times, and another one for being published in editions ending with 50 or 00, starting from issue 200.</p><p> On these special editions, you can also win special, exclusive item prizes! The prize depends on the issue, each one is different.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/ntwriter.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/107_1.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/ntstar.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to collaborate with another member on an Neopian Times entry? </b><br>
Yes, you are! If you do, state in the comments, when sending your submission, that it has been done in collaboration, and cite the other person's UN. If you're published, you both get the rewards.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/202_gelert_uni.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are Editorial questions counted as Neopian Times entries? </b><br>
Editorial questions are not counted as entries. All other sections count, though.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I didn't get my trophy/rewards from being published in the Neopian Times. What should I do? </b><br>
Send a ticket to the Neopets Team (and NM tnt_aesop) detailing your publication and the issue of Neopian Times you've been published on. Remember Editorial doesn't count as a publication for avatar and rewards, though.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I heard that referencing some modern technologies is not allowed to be mentioned in the Neopian Times. What might those subjects be? </b><br>
Any tecnology that does not belong to the world of neopets. Such as cars, planes, videogames, computers (unless from Space Station), etc. As a general rule of thumb, try to use technologies that have already been created on the game by TNT, such as neomail, Virtupets spaceships, and bicycles. For a comprehensive list, click <a href="//www.neopets.com/help_search.phtml?help_id=172">here</a>.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/betterthanyou/contestant81.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I'm collaborating with a friend, but my friend got frozen. Can I still enter our entries under both of our accounts even under their predicament?</b><br>
If one of you has been frozen, the entry will not be published until he/she is unfrozen. Be sure that both of you follow the rules to not risk having your entry disqualified for this reason.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about the Neopian Times? </b><br>
It is extremely important to submit as early as possible, but the best time is two weeks prior the upcoming Wednesday. Getting into The Neopian Times can be difficult, and on some weeks, TNT may even announce that they will be skipping that week's issue of The Neopian Times.</p>

<h3><a name="caption"></a>Caption Contest Related</h3>

<p><b>▸ What is the Caption Contest? </b><br>
The <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/new_caption.phtml">Caption Contest</a> is a monthly Creative Contest where users will enter their best descriptions for a provided image. These descriptions are usually a witty single sentence or short comedic dialogue between the Neopets/Petpets in the picture, for chance at being awarded a trophy, avatar, Neopoints, and a cool prize from an assortment of items. The first challenge is having your entry chosen and the real challenge is advertising your entry afterwards.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/captionwinner.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/trophies/100_1.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/trophies/100_2.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/trophies/100_3.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/ava_cap_contest.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What can I win from the Caption Contest? </b><br>
The Caption Contest is considered a Creative Contest meaning you can win a random prize from a pool of awesome items! There are also Neopoints, trophies, and avatars for winning under certain conditions such as achieving certain placements and placing in certain rounds. A Ghostkerchief Pen was awarded on the 1,000th, 1,300th, 1,400th, and 1,420th round.</p><p>

Caption Contest - Hilarious (the Aisha) is being awarded to the top 5 winners in every non-10th round of the Caption Contest starting from Round #1407. On round #1420 and #1430, any winner in the top 25 who already had the "Caption Contest - Funny" avatar was awarded this avatar.</p><p>

Caption Contest - Funny (the Grundo) is being awarded to the top 25 winners in every 10th round ever since Round #1400. Prior to Round #1400, it was awarded every 100th rounds.</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> Jellyneo's Creative Contest Rewards <br>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a limit on how many entries I can enter? </b><br>
There is no limit on how many entries you can enter in the Caption Contest.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/231_illusen_letters.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How many times can I vote for a caption entry? Am I allowed to vote for my own entry?</b><br>
You can vote every 4 hours and you are allowed to vote for your own Caption. However, you are still limited to one vote every 4 hours. </p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to vote from side accounts? </b><br>
You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to vote from side accounts.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Who decides which Caption Contest entry gets in? What's allowed in the Caption Contest?</b><br>
TNT handpicks the CC entries themselves. Your entry must be family friendly and within Neopets rules. Overused jokes and clichés are discouraged, but they are often chosen in the Caption Contest nowadays. You can find a short list of rejected phrases over at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/help_search.phtml?string=caption">Caption Contest FAQ here</a>.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/131_uni_funnyface.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are the rules of advertising my Caption Contest entry?</b><br>
The rules are simliar to the Beauty Contest, but here's a quick rundown:<br>
- You are allowed to advertise anywhere on the NeoBoards with your CC entry in your signature (<strong>NOT</strong> the post).<br>
- For NeoBoard advertising, your post has to be on-topic to the NeoBoard and contribute to the thread's discussion.<br>
- For Guild advertising, same rules as two above. You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed request votes in your Guilds.<br>
- You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to create a thread/post that is purely for CC entry advertising (aka asking for votes). <br>
- You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to spam short NeoBoard responses like gl, lol, BFA, etc. <br>
- You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to trade/buy votes.<br>
- You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to advertise off-site (including Neopets's own social medias).<br>
- You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to advertise from your shop.<br>
- You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to advertise/ask for votes for another person's entry.<br>
- You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to advertise/vote from your side account.<br>
- You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to advertise on the Notice Boards.<br>
- You are allowed to advertise from your userlookup and pet's userlookup.<br>
- Advertising through petpages and neomails are a gray area and can be reportable as spam varying on the situation.</p><p>

</p><br><p><b>▸ What was and happened to the NeoCam? </b><br>
The NeoCam was an office monitor that would take a snapshot of the Neopets Office every fifteen seconds for players to get to know TNT more and to gain a sneak peek of potential future content in store for them. TNT would often showcase upcoming merchandise, Neopets cosplays, and other fun office shenanigans.</p><p>

On May 16, 2007, the NeoCam stopped updating when Viacom TNT moved their office. Viacom (and at some point JumpStart) TNT contemplated the idea of bringing back the Neocam through the Editorial, but this site feature has yet to be revived. JumpStart TNT informed us that bringing back the NeoCam involved great difficulty due to a number of factors such as legal issues with other brands, requiring consent from all the staff members, and the change in office location, and so bringing the NeoCam back is currently infeasible.

<br><p><b>▸ Why did my entry get rejected/errored immediately from the Art Gallery? </b><br>
Here's a quick list of reasons why your entry might be rejected from the art-related competitions:<br>
- It wasn't your own artwork (stealing another member's artwork if a freezable offence). 
<br>- It has copyright or trademark symbols (having your UN is fine, but it cannot be copyrighted)
<br>- It has won another art-related competition.
<br>- It has little to no relation to Neopets at all.
<br>- It exceeds the size limits.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/msn_buddy/msn_aishaartist.gif"></p>

<strong> Hello, TNT! In Editorial #653, you said that sketches aren't allowed in the Art Gallery. May I ask what constitutes a sketch? For example, if an entry has tones and shading but is drawn in a sketchy style, would that be acceptable? Thanks! ~dragonair23 <p></p></strong>
</p><p> This is, of course, a judgement call by our judges, as there is no fine line. Something unlikely to be accepted as possible winners are rough sketches or things like very simple pencil line drawings with no shading. A sketchy style is just fine as long as it comes across as a finished work of art, and not an incomplete one. Here are some compositions to help you get a better visual idea of what we're looking for:</p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/images/kougra2.gif"><br>Incomplete. Would not be accepted as an entry.<p></p><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/week24/Aishahead1.gif" style="height: 150px; width: 150px;"><br> Acceptable, but feels incomplete.<br>
Highly unlikely to win.<p></p><img src="//images.neopets.com/backgrounds/sketch/150_techomaster.gif"><br> Completed pencil drawing with good chance to win.<p></p><img src="//images.neopets.com/art/howto/ruki12.gif"><br>Finished line art. Could be a complete composition,<br>but unlikely to win unless high quality<br>with good use of line weight.</div>

<br><p><b>▸ Does my Art Gallery entry have to be on paper/digitally created? </b><br>
Art Gallery submissions are not limited to paper/digital drawings! We have seen chalk, clay, and art drawn on rocks!<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/caption/sm_caption_973.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are collabs allowed in the Art Gallery? </b><br>
Collaborative pieces are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed in the Art Gallery.

</p><p>- Neopets Editorial - Issue 901 | Question 5 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=901">link</a>] (Collabs are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed in the Art Gallery)</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to enter more than one entry to the Art Gallery? </b><br>
You are allowed to submit multiple entries (three per day) to the Art Gallery. Do know that only one of your entries will be picked if you happen to be chosen. Submitting multiple entries does not boost your chance of being chosen.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/boo_slugawoo_art.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ So, I accidently submitted my winning Beauty Contest art piece to the Art Gallery? AM I IN TROUBLE???</b><br>
You would want to neomail tnt_contest_judge about it. People make mistakes, there will be no punishment for the removal of that accidental Beauty Contest entry. Just don't make it into a habit and you will be fine.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Poetry Contest? </b><br>
If drawing art isn't your expertise, Neopets has a poem writing competition! This is where you can showcase your poems, rhymes, and poetry talents. You can win 1,000 NP, a prize from the Creative Contest reward pool, and a cool trophy if you get chosen!<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/103_1.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ So when is the Poetry Contest? </b><br>
Nowadays, the Poetry Contest is released on Neopian holidays like pet days.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are collabs allowed in the Poetry Contest? </b><br>
Collaborative pieces are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed in the Poetry Contest.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to enter more than one entry to the Poetry Contest? </b><br>
You are allowed to enter as many entries as you want! Do know that only one of your entries will be picked if you happen to be chosen. Submitting multiple entries does not boost your chance of being chosen.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/clicktoplay/icon_103.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Will I get a rejection notice if my Poetry Contest entry doesn't make it in? </b><br>
Yes you will! Sometimes rejection neomails are sent out within a couple of weeks or definitely within 24 hours of the actual release day if it is a Neopian holiday.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What does it mean when my Poem is held over? </b><br>
This means that your entry will definitely be used for another Poetry Contest round! You do not need to resubmit your entry if you get the Neomail.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/tradingcards/med_293.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Pet/Petpet Spotlight? </b><br>
The Pet/Petpet Spotlight was where members can write and share about their pet or petpet's character, adventures, and other novelties. You were allowed to enter in both spotlights on your side accounts as you were only awarded a trophy on your pet for winning.</p><p>

Both spotlights have stopped updating since February 2019, but TNT has not declared them as retired/on hiatus.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/148_1.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/trophies/trophy_petspotlight_1.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Random Contest? </b><br>
The Random Contest is mostly an art and crafts contest, but the randomness comes in what the topic of the theme might be. This could have been real-life food, pillowcases, and other arbitrary creations. The most current ones have been standard art.</p><p>

There is no set schedule for the Random Contest anymore, it's pretty much when TNT feels like running one (which is probably like once a year).<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/479_1.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/479_2.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/479_3.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is the Random Contest still active? When is the next one?</b><br>
In a sense, the Random Contest is still alive. TNT would usually update in the Editorial and/or New Features when a new round up. </p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are collabs allowed in the Random Contest? </b><br>
Collaborative pieces are allowed in the Random Contest, but they are judged more harshly than single entries.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the User Lookup Spotlight? </b><br>
The User Lookup Spotlight is where members can show off their Neo-HTML talents on their User Lookup!<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/467_1.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Gallery Spotlight? </b><br>
The User Lookup Spotlight is where members can show off their item hoards and Neo-HTML talents on their Gallery.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/222_1.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are premades allowed in the Gallery/User Lookup Spotlight? </b><br>
Premades are allowed if the original source was credited and that the layout is not too similar to the original design. Premades that were edited slightly or layouts there are practically claiming stolen art/premade work as your own would not be accepted.</p>

<div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 718 | Question 2 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=718">link</a>]<p>
<strong> Dear CQ: I'm so confused! Today's news (4th February), after announcing the User Lookup of the Week winner, notes that a premade lookup is not allowed in the contest, and that submitting one could get us a warning and our trophy removed. I always thought that premades were just fine in the contest, as long as the content was ours and proper credit was given. Well, I looked it up! In the Editorial on issue 570 of the Neopian Times, published on the 9th day of Storing, Y14, there is an answer that seems to contradict today's news. Could you clarify? I've never sent in an entry to the contest, but I'd like to know what's allowed, for when I do. Thanks, CQ! I'll send you all the cookies!! ~ penelopedastardly
​<p></p></strong>
</p><p> Hi! Alright, to help clear up your confusion, there are essentially 3 different scenarios of using help, I felt fancy and listed them out nicely below (also we get a lot of entries that don't seem to totally understand the difference, so hopefully this will help!):<br><br>
Scenario 1: You look at some premades or tutorials for coding help, and use that to help you make your own. Your userlookup gives credit to wherever you received help from, but is not essentially that premade lookup with a couple changes.<br><br>
Outcome: You're good! Submit that thing and hope for the best! This is what that previous editorial was talking about :)<br><br>
Scenario 2: Your lookup is completely a premade, you made little or no change to it, and submit. It probably says somewhere "Lookup Coded by XXX", someone who is not you.<br><br>
Outcome: Nice lookup, and you will not get in trouble, but you will also not win a User Lookup spotlight, because we do not accept premades.<br><br>
Scenario 3: You use a lovely premade you found somewhere for your User Lookup with little or no changes to it, but somehow that little line of credit got left out *shifty eyes*<br><br>
Outcome: Not cool man! If that happens, we usually can't tell its a premade, and it could be spotlighted. If so, usually lots of helpful users let us know whats up (sorry we can't always tell guys, we just can't learn them all. Plus sometimes we see it happen where they change the main picture so it's not easily recognizable either. Ugh.). Here is where you find yourself in hot water. We'll replace your entry, remove your trophy and give you a warning (the first time, if we catch you doing something like this again in any spotlight, you won't be so lucky).</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ Does our Gallery/User Lookup Spotlight entries have to be Neopets related? </b><br>
User Lookup Spotlight entries do have to relate to Neopets in some way with the addition of the Spotlight Rules. Gallery Spotlight entries can pretty much be anything as long it follows Spotlight Rules.</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 560 | Question 4 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=560">link</a>]<p>
<strong> I'd really like to make a User Lookup and submit it to the spotlight, but I was wondering if my submission would be accepted if it was not Neopets-themed. For example, if I had a well-coded Star Trek-themed lookup, would I still have a chance at winning the spotlight? Thanks! :D ~mariesg1 <p></p></strong>
</p><p> Nope. Only Neopets-themed content is considered for any of our creative contests, including the User Lookup Spotlight, no matter how well done the submission is.</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to enter in the Gallery/User Lookup Spotlight on a side account? </b><br>
You are allowed to participate in the Gallery/User Lookup Spotlight on a side account.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/boo_gallery_toast.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are rejection notices still given out to the Gallery/User Lookup Spotlight? </b><br>
Rejection notices are still given out for the User Lookup Spotlight, but not the Gallery Spotlight.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are Neocash items necessary for Gallery Spotlight? </b><br>
Neocash items are not required nor necessary for the Gallery Spotlight.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_downwithnc_flag.gif"></p>

<h3><a name="beautycontest"></a>Beauty Contest Related</h3>

<p><b>▸ What is the Beauty Contest? </b><br>
The Beauty Contest (BC) is an art-themed Creative Contest where you draw your Neopet and advertise in hopes of getting them a shiny trophy (+ avatar for yourself). You may draw from scratch or edit an official Neopets image, but if you do the latter, alterations must look like they took at least five minutes to be accepted.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/trophies/trophy_beauty_1.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/trophies/trophy_beauty_2.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/trophies/trophy_beauty_3.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What can I win from the Beauty Contest? </b><br>
If you win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in species and/or overall, you will earn a trophy for your pet's lookup! Winning overall will give you a second trophy, along with your species win. Placing top 3 in any of the species will award the avatar.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/beautycontest.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ When does the Beauty Contest start/restart? </b><br>
The BC starts around 12:10 PM - 12:15 PM NST on every Friday. The time seems to vary some weeks, but that's the general timeline.

</p><p>NOTE: If you submit a drawing too close to the deadline, your entry may take a while to be visible and voted for (as Kikocat has to approve of entries before they can be made public), so it's best advised to submit either before or on the Wednesday before your desired week.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/template_images/art_elephante_painting.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are the size limitation for the Beauty Contest? </b><br>
- Your image must be at most 75 Kilobytes in size.<br>
- Your image must be of file type .gif or .jpg.<br>
- Optional, but you would want your image must be at most 800 pixels wide and 800 pixels tall to avoid screen stretching in your Beauty Contest entry.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How many times can I vote in the Beauty Contest? </b><br>
You can vote once per species. So be certain that you want to vote for an entry, as you won't get your votes back even if the entry is removed! You may also <strong>ONLY vote on your MAIN account</strong>. Using multiple accounts to vote is cheating. However, if you do accidentally vote on a side account, be sure to not do it again for that species on your main and to finish voting on your main. TNT understands that we make mistakes, but it's obvious when you're doing it on purpose to either raise your voting amount or the amount of an entry you really like.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Does the color of my pet have to match my Beauty Contest submission? </b><br>
Nope! It just has to be the same species.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to enter in the Beauty Contest on my side accounts? </b><br>
Yes, you may enter from a side account, <strong>BUT</strong> you must advertise your entries from the account(s) your pet(s) are on, and <strong>ONLY</strong> vote from your main.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/box_donation_charity.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are the easiest/hardest species to compete with in the Beauty Contest? </b><br>
The popular species, such as Cybunny, Kougra, Lupe, Aisha, and Draik tend to be super hard and only for the brave-of-heart. Unpopular species such as Ruki, Quiggle, Nimmo, Tonu, and Tuskaninny are generally very empty and may also be filled with repeated entries. They may have their rough weeks, but generally, they are rather easy. Medium categories encompass species such as Shoyru, Gelert, and Peophin; they are rather popular. However, an easy category can become hard, and a hard category can become easy, just like that. There's no way to really determine how the categories will turn out until the new contest rolls around.

<br><p><b>▸ Where can I advertise my Beauty Contest entry? </b><br>
As of March 2020, you are now allowed to advertise your Beauty Contest entries in your neoSignature anywhere on the NeoBoards! You used to be limited to the Art Chat, Spotlight Chat, and Premium Chat (Charter).</p><p> 

Not new, but aside from the NeoBoards, you are allowed to advertise your Beauty Contest entry on your Userlookup, Pet's Lookup, and Petpages.</p><p>

Do remember to practice good posting etiquette, don't just pop into threads and say "GL" for that is considered spam. Neomailing your NeoFriends to ask them to check out your BC entry is fine if they are okay with getting them. If they are not okay with your Beauty Contest advertising Neomails, they are allowed to report it as spam. Very recently, bumping your own thread, outside the Art/Spotlight/Premium Chat, with the context only being your BC entry in that post is now considered spam

</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 902 | Question 2 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=902">link</a>]<p>
<strong> Hi! I hope you are all doing well. Is there any chance you could let us know if advertising Beauty Contest entries on chat boards other than the Art Chat is allowed? Previously, in issue 887's editorial, it seemed like you reconsidered and would allow it so long as players were making real, substantive posts on chat topics and not brief token posts like "GL!" Or did you mean for the advice you gave in NT issue #887 to only apply to players trying to drum up votes in the Caption Contest? Thanks for your time &amp; please remove my UN. ~Name Removed <p></p></strong>
</p><p> Hi, That is for the Beauty Contest (Caption Contest also) but you can post your link in your Neosig outside the Art, Spotlight and Premium boards now (ONLY in your Neosig though) as long as you are contributing to the conversation.</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ Art-wise, what is not allowed in the Beauty Contest? </b><br>
Here's a quick list of things not allowed, art-wise, in the Beauty Contest:<br>
- Humans are allowed in the BC, but they <strong>CANNOT</strong> be the main focus; You are allowed to enter anthro (Neopets with human features) drawings, but <strong>NO</strong> humans with Neopet features (ex. Aisha ears or a Gelert tail). Humans overall are a grey area.<br>
- Suggestive content and nudity are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed. Topless males are okay.<br>
- Also, <strong>NO</strong> real life weapons. Neopets weapons are okay.<br>
- <strong>NO</strong> religious symbols or flags. Neopian and Altador Cup flags are okay.<br>
- <strong>NO</strong> violence or death scenes. Make sure your entry is G-rated.

</p><br><p><b>▸ Can I reuse a Beauty Contest entry? </b><br>
Yes and no. You may use an entry more than once (although it's generally frowned upon by the art chat if it's placed before), but there are some conditions.</p><p>

1. Entries can only be used for <strong>ONE</strong> pet, even if you transfer or morph the pet later.</p><p>

2. If the art entry has won gold, it <strong>CANNOT</strong> be entered again. Draw a new piece, keep those creative juices flowing!</p><p>

3. An entry <strong>CANNOT</strong> be used in multiple creative contests. If it has won any trophies from the Beauty Contest, you may not re-use it for the Art Gallery, or vice versa!</p><p>

4. Reusing the same lineart (for example, an adoptable you made) is <strong>NOT</strong> allowed if it has won gold for another pet. Again, the pic has to be entirely new and not just re-edited to enter for another pet.<br>
(Note: Rule 4 was stated by Kikocat at one point, during one of her boards.)<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/gif_autohansolitho.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to reuse my art for the Art Gallery/Beauty Contest/Pet Spotlight/etc.? </b><br>
If you did not win a contest or spotlight with that art piece, you are allowed to submit it to a different competition. The only time you are allowed to reuse the same art piece multiple times after winning is for the Beauty Contest, if you adhere to its rules.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are collabs allowed in the Beauty Contest? </b><br>
Collaborative pieces are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed in the Beauty Contest.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the difference between Silent Voting, Non-Silent Voting, and Manual Voting? </b><br>
Silent Voting (SVing) is when you are voting for Beauty Contest entries, but you are not publicly stating whose. Non-Silent Voting (NSVing) is when you are publicly posting who you are voting for. Manual Voting (MVing) is when you are just browsing through the Beauty Contest voting pages and picking which entries you like.

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to trade/buy votes? </b><br>
No, you are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to exchange/purchase Beauty Contest votes with/from another user.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is a Gold Ban (or being Goldbanned)? </b><br>
A Gold Ban is when you win first place and are rewarded with a 30-day ban from the Beauty Contest on your pet because you were amazing! It's nothing bad as this was implemented to prevent repeated wins from the same pet/person. Before August 25, 2017, the ban duration was 4 months long!<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/2080.gif"></p>

We may take harsher actions if things become more out of control, such as warning or freezing your main accounts for your poor behaviour on sides in this situation.

<h1>Avatars FAQs</h1>
<p><b>▸ What are avatars? </b><br>

<h3><a name="collavatars"></a>Collecting Avatars Related</h3>

<p><b>▸ Where do I start collecting avatars? </b><br>
A solid start is getting the clickable avatars - all you need to get those is a link! JellyNeo has a pretty good page on how to get them:</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I collect avatars on my side account? </b><br>
Yes and no! Side account rules apply to avatar collecting, which means you can't do any activities that earn you NPs or tradeable items. You can, however, collect:</p><p>
- All clickable avatars;<br>
- The following annually available avatars: Blumaroo - Chef Bonju, Happy Birthday!, Easter Cybunny, Quiguki April Fools Avatar, Gadgadsbogen!, Valentine Chia, I *heart* Sloth.<br>
- Most item-related avatars (except the ones that require you to buy in Neopian shops), just as long as the item comes from your main account or someone lends it to your side;<br>
- Most pet/petpet-related avatars, except for Good Day at the Bank. If the avatar requires your pet to interact with an item, it must come from your main account.</p><p>

</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 310 | Question 1 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=310">link</a>]<p>
<strong> My friend's MAIN account was recently suspended for around 2 days (48 hrs.). However, she created a side account at the time so she could continue to chat in the guild and such. She then also began to get avatars, though. I read some previous Editorials and learned that playing games were not allowed. So does that also mean earning avatars, even if the avatars were from games? Also, because her account was suspended, there was no way of sending the Neopoints or items to her main in the first place. Mk. Thanks. (: ~omgringo <p></p></strong>
</p><p>Earning certain kinds of avatars on side accounts is fine, like clickables or ones where you need a certain type of Neopet or Petpet, etc. Avatars that require you to play games or do dailies that can grant you either NP or an item is off-limits on side accounts, though. You may not use side accounts as mains during suspension periods.</p></div>


<br><p><b>▸ Is there any occasion where a retired avatar is rereleased? </b><br><i>Very</i> rarely TNT deems fit to rerelease a retired avatar, but you definitely shouldn't count on it! It's best to be safe than sorry with avatars, as you never know if or when they'll be gone.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/foreverloading.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Avatar Simon? </b><br>
It's a game commonly played on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=21">Avatar Chat</a>. It's played in rounds, and in each one OP will randomly pick one of their avatars; the players must quickly change their active avatar to the same OP picked, and a player gets eliminated when OP changes their avatar to one they don't have. It'll go like this for a few rounds until eventually, only one player will stay, and thus win.</p><p>
Do keep in mind that you can't actually earn anything from this, though, as it isn't an official Neopets game - it's just for fun! </p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about collecting avatars? </b><br>
Don't get yourself down if you're unable to get an avatar as quick compared to others. Collecting some avatars might take time, patience, and/or dedication to achieve!</p>

<h3><a name="avatarlend"></a>Avatar Lending Related</h3>

<p><b>▸ What is avatar lending? </b><br>
Lending is when another player lets you borrow one of their items or pets so you can get a shiny new avatar!<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/pantdeviltaunt.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/lawyerbot.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/firekougra.gif"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mYwRwAL.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/chokato.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/superpea.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/meowclops_close.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/grarrlwarrior.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/evilpoogle.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/queenfyora.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/zaffydoubleagent.gif"><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/cocojubjub.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/fireblumaroo.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/foreverorange.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/snicklebeasty.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/huggy.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/islandquiggle.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/mootix.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/white_snowbunnies.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/quadrapus.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/mummifiedruki.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/werelupe.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What type of avatar lends are there? </b><br>
There are item lends and pet lends.</p><p>

Item lends are usually done using the Trading Post or Give to NeoFriend function. The Trading Post is more used when you are lending multiple items and/or the lender is wanting collateral for their item lend. The Give to Neofriend function is much quicker than the Trading Post, but there is no confirmation when the item is received.</p><p>

Pet lends are usually done by adopting pets from the Pound or transferring pets from accounts lending avatar pets. Most avatar pets in the pound tend to have a stuck name (cannot be found in the pound normally unless its name is searched directly) which makes adopting and abandoning to the next account quite quick and easy. Transferring avatar pets requires you to use up a "transfer" which is a direct send or swap to your account. The number of transfers you can get is tied to your account age. Some pet lends might require your account to be at least four months old. An explanation on pet transfers can be found here:</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> JN's Neopian Pound Guide<br>
jellyneo.net/?go=pound#transfer

</p><br><p><b>▸ What is the procedure of getting a lend of an avatar item/pet? </b><br>
You either create a thread on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=21">Avatar NeoBoard Chat</a> asking for the specific item you want to borrow or you wait until you see someone on the boards lending the item/pet you want.

</p><br><p><b>▸ What is collaterial? </b><br>
Collateral is a sort of warranty you send for the lender in exchange for the item, just in case something happens to it; it can be either partial or full, and pure or in items.
A full collateral is the entire value of the item you're asking a lend, whereas a partial collateral is only a fraction of it; pure means you have the value (be it partial or full) in Neopoints, and in items means you have it in easy-to-sell items such as the Baby Paint Brush.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/babypaintbrush.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where do I find these avatar lenders? </b><br>
They're usually lurking around the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=21">Avatar NeoBoard Chat</a> waiting for a board asking for an item to be created, but sometimes they create boards announcing the items they have to lend themselves.</p><p>

It's common courtesy not to send Neomails to lenders unless they specifically say their inbox is open to those, and not to disclose the UNs of lenders with more expensive avatar items as to not attract attention from malicious players to their accounts.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/template_images/boxday_sharing.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I make my account worthy of being lent an avatar item? </b><br>
You can get easy avatars in order to increase your count, paint your pets, get game trophies, be active on the forums, etc. Anything that lets others know you're dedicated to your account will raise your chances of getting a lend! Even a simple user lookup made by you from scratch, instead of opting for a premade, goes - remember that most of the time the people letting you borrow their hard-earned items and pets won't know you at all and vice-versa, so all they'll have to judge if you can get an item or not is your account and how hard you work on it. Don't get discouraged if someone doesn't lend you an item and ask the lender what you could improve on your account instead!

</p><br><p><b>▸ Are you allowed to profit off avatar lends? </b><br>
Absolutely not! Lending should be done out of the person's own goodwill, and trying to profit from it in any way is against the rules.

</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 276 | Question 5 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=276">link</a>]<p>
<strong> On the Quest Board, users often create posts saying "Quest Help for 250 NP!" Their topic then says that they will look up an item on the Shop Wizard, put the item in their shop, and add an extra 250 NPs to the price so that they can earn a profit. (Of course, they're free to set their own shop prices.) We regular QB helpers believe this is a scam, although a blatantly stated one. By using the FREE Shop Wizard, this person will earn NPs because someone else cannot use the SW. They argue that this is not stated in the rules; therefore, they can do it. We counter that chat rule #6, which doesn't let you perform services for NPs, makes this a scam. We would just like clarification as to whether saying "I am charging you for my help." is against the rules or not. Thanks. ~alatyr13<p></p></strong>
</p><p>You are quite correct that this type of activity is not allowed! Those who try to charge others for services, be it art, avatar lending, or using the SSW or normal Shop Wizard will get this lovely little warning in their Neomail inbox:</p><p>

<i>You may not ask for or offer any services or use Neopets images or materials to earn money, Neopoints, or Neopets' Items. This is a violation of Neopets copyright and trademark rights and the Terms and Conditions, and is strictly forbidden.</i></p><p>

There are a remarkable number of ways to make Neopoints that don't resort to breaking the Terms and Conditions of the site. Perhaps those trying to sell services should look into them.</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ What happens when someone steals an avatar item from the lender? </b><br>
Unfortunately, TNT doesn't entirely endorse avatar lending; while they let players lend items and pets as they please, they don't encourage it.
That doesn't mean that if someone steals an item they'll get away with it, though - stealing is completely against the site rules and the offender will get their account frozen, but it's not always that TNT will be able to get the stolen item back to its original owner.

</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 308 | Question 16 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=308">link</a>]<p>
<strong> Hello TNT, you guys are doing an awesome job! You rock! Anyway, people on the boards are trading items (such as chokatos, to get the avvie) and then giving it back to the owner. People are getting **RARE** items for free, and it's not fair to the Neopians who are working hard to earn NP to buy rare items and get the avvie. Also, some people are complaining that they got their items stolen from item lending. Isn't that against the rules?!? If it IS against the rules, isn't it their own fault for their items getting stolen? Please leave my name out. Thankies! ~ [removed]<p></p></strong>
</p><p>Lending items isn't currently against the rules. Item/NP pools for avatars or paying for a lend are, though. As long as those aren't going on it's okay. While, of course, we'd prefer that people earn their own way, we can't really look down upon those who are kind enough to share the wealth. We salute those who continue to show empathy by lending items despite knowing full well that there are a horrid number of dishonest folk who will take advantage of others' kindness and steal. Those are the players we truly frown upon. (Seriously, stealing from someone who's offering you their trust and generally being kind to others? How low can you possibly go? Certainly, nothing on Neopets is worth the loss of personal integrity... it just boggles our minds how anyone could do such a thing.) Anyway, if you've lent and been victimized by a dishonest player, please report him or her immediately with a clear description of what happened so that all their accounts can be frozen.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/tcg_0187_CI23.gif"><br><i>It's always about what they want.<br>

Sadly, no. Since TNT doesn't totally endorse avatar lending, they don't take responsibility for this kind of thing.

</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 753 | Question 5 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=308">link</a>]<p>
<strong> I'd like a clarification of something from two weeks ago's editorial. "I recently created a new side account and adopted several neopets out of the pound. One of these Neopets had a petpet attached. At first, I thought I'd just leave it be, but then I looked the petpet up and found out it was valuable. Can I sell the petpet if I transfer it to my main first, or is this considered using a side account to cheat? P.S. Please remove my UN. ~ UN removed Hi! You adopted the petpet, it's yours to do what you want with! If you transfer it to your main, you can sell it if you want to." This makes it sound like it's okay to use the pound for financial gain. This text "Note: The Neopian Pound is not to be abused for financial gain. Selling Neopets, or profiting from abandoned Neopets is a freezable offense." is found on the first page of the pound. This makes it sound like adopting a pet to sell its petpet is not okay but your past editorial makes it sound okay. Please advice. ~ johnnydeppluver1222<p></p></strong>
</p><p>Hi! So the notice on the Pound page refers to trading Neopets for Neopoints (or neopoint items) via the Pound. You can trade Neopet for other Neopets, but not anything else, and doing so is a freezable offense. However, adopting a pet and realizing it has a petpet is a different issue - that's an item we cannot force you to keep (and we have no interest in doing so).</p></div>

<h1>Battledome FAQs</h1>
<p><b>▸ What is the Battledome? </b><br>
The Battledome is a place where your Neopets can fight famous Neopian characters (and friends) for glory and riches! Get those Battledome weapons ready, because those opponents are waiting for ya!<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/2012_newbd_closed_beta.jpg"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I win anything from battling? Is the Battledome worth it? </b><br>
The Battledome is very well worth it as a daily! You can win Codestones, Dubloons, and other fun goodies! You do not get any NP or items when battling against another Neopian player (2-Player/2P), but it is still fun to try out!</p>

<h3><a name="bdbasics"></a>Battledome Basics Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ How do I get started with Battledome? </b><br>
You just equip some weapons onto your pet and click around to fight around! You also have to train your pets too, but I'd check out these guides for a more detailed explaination on how to start the Battledome:</p><p>

<p><b>▸ Which Battledome opponent has the best daily prizes? </b><br>
Well that depends on your stats, but overall these opponents yield the most choice rewards:</p><p>

Beginner: Chia Clown and S750 Kreludan Defender Robot<br>
Chia Clown for his Chocolate Ice Cream drop and Robot for his Neocola Tokens and small chance of Armoured Neggs. I recommend to challenge on Hard.</p><p>

Intermediate: Koi Warrior //OR// Jetsam Ace (Premium Only)<br>
Koi Warrior's area drops Codestones more frequently than others with the addition of Dubloons as well. Jetsam Ace drops Nerkmids. Challenge on their hardest difficulty if possible.</p><p>

Advanced: Giant Spectral Mutant Walein //OR// Giant Space Fungus (Premium Only)<br>
Fungus on Hard difficulty as it has a similar Nerkmid rate to Jetsame Ace but also gives out Bubbling Fungus. Non-premium players should challenge the Walein on Medium for the smallest challenger-specific prize pool and therefore higher codestone rate.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/dome/npcs/00031_f5208f232a_chiaclown/portrait_31.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/dome/npcs/00206_77cb4f274c_s750kreludandefenderrobot/portrait_206.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/dome/npcs/00026_aa83536006_koiwarrior/portrait_26.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/dome/npcs/00212_719eadcc38_jetsamace/portrait_212.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/dome/npcs/00210_e6de64fe99_giantspectralmutantwalein/portrait_210.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/dome/npcs/00211_ea41c92694_giantspacefungus/portrait_211.png"><br>IF YOU HAVE PREMIUM, FIGHT THE PREMIUM FIGHTS IF YOU CAN</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a limit of how many rewards I can get from the Battledome? </b><br>
At max, you can win up to 1,500 NP and 15 items once per day. You can check the prize pools for the areana and challengers over at this guide:

<br><p><b>▸ What weapons should I be using? </b><br>
It depends on your what your current set is, stats, budget, and species. If you have a relevant goal such whether you aiming to beat any specific challengers, and whether you play 1P or 2P BD, you'd want to read up on what might be the best fit for your pet from the guides listed below. For 2P equipment advice, the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=10">Battledome NeoBoard Chat</a> (or those dedicated League weapon petpages) would probably be your best bet.

battlepedia.jellyneo.net/ </p>

<br><p><b>▸ Does it matter which species I have for the Battledome? </b><br>
Your choice of species do not matter in the Battledome unless you wish to use certain healers and/or freezers. There used to be a feature called Species Resistances/Weaknesses, but those were all removed in the new Battledome.</p><p>

Species With Notable Healers: Blumaroo, Elephante, Gelert, Lenny, Nimmo, Shoyru, Uni, and Kacheek.<br>
Species Notable Freezers: Chia, Lenny, and Lupe (Fragile), and Peophin.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Do icon types matter? </b><br>
Icon typing is secondary in 1-P Battling. The reason being is that a large quantity of icons would be more practical when using abilities such as Lens Flare or Warlocks Rage, or when the opponent is frozen. Using a mass iconage might overcome your opponent's defensive capabilities.</p><p>

In 2-P Battling icon typing plays a more important role as there are usually restrictions to using stunning abilities and/or freezing. You are going to have to strategize to work against your own and your opponent's dual-duties, shields, reflectors, etc. <br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/dome/pages/abilities_icons.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is X Weapon any good? </b><br>
I'd check out Jellyneo's In-Depth Battlepedia to see the weapon's information and reviews from the JN BD Staffers. You can always ask at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=10">Battledome NeoBoard Chat</a> if you want a response on how that weapon might be doing in this current day of age as well. If I'm gonna be real, like 95% of all weapons are pretty terrible in 1-Player BD.

<br><p><b>▸ Why can't I enter my pet in the Battledome? </b><br>
This is a quick list of reasons why you cannot fight with your pet:<br>
- Your pet has no/negative HP.<br>
- Your pet is sick.<br>
- Your pet is already fighting against another opponent.<br>
- Your pet is being being transferred/travelling to another account.<br><br></p><p><b>▸ What are Faerie Abilities? What are the best ones? </b><br>
Faerie Abilites are side ski<i></i>lls that can be used when making a move. You can use them offensively, defensively, and even heal from them. The most notable abilities are An Icicle, Lens Flare, Warlock's Rage, Reflect, and Rejuvenate. This guide below goes in-depth on why are they're pretty awesome:

</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> The Faerie Ability Guide<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~_mariokart_">/~_mariokart_</a><br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/bd2/abilities/0002_qx4b5ievrb_anicicle/thumb_2.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/dome/abilities/0021_c4hje5rwjo_lensflare/thumb_21.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/dome/abilities/0028_dy54g2o31z_warlocksrage/thumb_28.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/bd2/abilities/0031_3hrei48dgh_reflect/thumb_31.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/dome/abilities/0029_ah54yubiow_rejuvenate/thumb_29.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I beat X 1P opponent? </b><br>
Some guides might have a brute force method, a cloak and dagger method, etc. I often just plan out on what my opponent's HP is and see what I can possibly do with my current set is, stats, budget, and species. 1P is all about maxing out your total damage output (or at least reaching the minimum of your opponent's HP).</p><p>

If I have the NP and I wanna fight like Chia Clown or S750 Kreludan Defender Robot for the BD rewards, then I'll just get a Cursed Elixir and a Downsize!, because that'll allow me to drain all their HP without having me to heal afterwards. If I don't have the NP, then I'll use Scroll of Ultranovas to bash them in and heal myself with a Magical Healing Potion while using a Downsize! mid-battle.</p><p>

If you need help formulating a strategy for Meuka, Black Pteri, Space Faerie, or even 2P battles, then I'd check out the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=10">Battledome NeoBoard Chat</a>!<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/nt_images/605_judge_robot.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where can I unlock X opponent? </b><br>
Jellyneo has a Checklist Tool for that! It'll provide you with all the instructions on how to unlock those opponents.

</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> JN's Battledome Challenger Checklist Tool<br>
battlepedia.jellyneo.net/?go=challenger_checklist</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I exit a battle?</b><br>
Go to the <a href="//www.neopets.com/dome/status.phtml">Challenges Tab</a> and click the big red button that says WITHDRAW. This will count as a loss.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Does difficulty affect the Battledome rewards?</b><br>
Kinda, but not really. Certain difficulties have exclusive rewards and like the amount of Neopoints earned per battle increases the harder the difficulty. There is a common assumption that the smaler the prize pool, the greater chance you will receive the arena rewards (a reason why Dome of the Deep is largely recommended).<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/386_mau_codestone.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why can't I see the battle log? How do I fix that?</b><br>
If you have an ad-blocker, you might have to disable that to see your Battle Log again.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How does Freezing status work? </b><br>
If you successfully freeze your opponent, they won't be able to use any of their weapons or abilities on the next turn. This is most useful when you want to unleash everything you've got with nothing to stop you!<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bvs_freeze.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/battledome/icons/frozen.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_freezeray_random.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How did Stealing weapons work? </b><br>
When Stealing Weapons were functional, you used to be able to take your opponent's most top-left equipped item, leaving your opponent unable to use that equipment for the rest of the battle. The stolen item would later be returned to your opponent when the fight was over. 

</p><p>This was most useful when testing Single Use and Fragile weapons, using Chia/Kacheek Flour to easily morph pets, etc. Stealers were disabled from Battledome plots (and all were given a limit of one stealing weapon per set), because long ago someone did find out you could take down a final boss of a certain plot by taking all their weapons! It was an exciting time. ;D

</p><p>In the new Battledome, Stealers are bugged and do not work anymore. Heavy Robe of Thievery, Rainbow Sticky Hand, and Purple Sticky Hand were the most commonly used Stealing equipment.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_kacheek_flour.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_purple_stickyhand.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bva_heavyrobe.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is Punchbag Sid still active?</b><br>
Nope, although there has been discussion of his return from the Editorial.

</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 710 | Question 4 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=710">link</a>]<p>
<strong> Is there any chance that Punchbag Sid can put in an appearance? TNT, the old team, used to have him show up every year or so. Would be nice to be able to get that rare avatar on this account... Sends the Neopian staff bags of popcorn... to eat or to string for Christmas decorations ~ platdragon<p></p></strong>
</p><p>Yay! *starts to string along popcorn for decoration, gets bored and eats the popcorn instead* Hmm, we haven't been in touch with old Sid in a long time. He's not too good at returning phone calls, ya see, with the being a punchbag and all. Maybe the new year will inspire him to come out of hiding.</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ What is broken with the Battledome?</b><br>
A lot of things are broken, unfortunately (Defenders of Neopia, Stealing, Lens Flare/Throw Pillow spam from 1P opponents, High Score Table, etc.). A compiled list and their explanations can be found here:

</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> Everything wrong with the Battledome <br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Samuelosaurus">/~Samuelosaurus</a><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~_mariokart_">/~_mariokart_</a></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a way how to reset your Battle Record?</b><br>
Nope, it's all permanent. </p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Featured Challenges?</b><br>
It's a Battledome feature that was never implemented.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/chiacomputer.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where can I get advice or other information that wasn't mentioned here? </b><br>
I'd check out the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=10">Battledome NeoBoard Chat</a> to ask around! </p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about the Battledome? </b><br>
Battledome is pretty much stale in terms of TNT producing new/fixed content, but there's still a group of players that still believe that one day TNT will bring back the old features like HP Increase, Battle Stances, old Battle Records, etc.


</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 855 | Question 7 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=855">link</a>]<p>
<strong> Battledome Results:<p></p></strong>
</p><p>After nearly a year of delay, the survey results are finally in! We apologise for the lag on our part, our attention has been dragged into a million and one directions in this past year. We want to improve the site in so many ways. And there are so many things to do here in Neopia as you all know and different users have different tastes and interests so we attempt to reach in all directions for change but sometimes we bite off a little too much. So finally we are ready to tackle the fixes that are Battledome. So with that let's get into a brief summary of the results. We had about 10,000 or so users participate last January! We were overwhelmed with great feedback and results that will help us move into the stages of fixes we hope to begin very soon. Scrappy is away at our other HQ for the week, so the second she gets back we hope to dive in head first. So let's just jump into it.</p><p>

-68% of you have been playing for 11-19 years! Which is insanely awesome!

<br><br>-50% of you play 21 plus times a week.

<br><br>-A lot of you want us to focus on fixing the foresight glitch which we also really want to find a solution to.

<br><br>-In terms of stances 17% of you thought they were super important while 30% were neutral.

<br><br>-Featured Challengers received 19% neutral yet 26% found it super important.

<br><br>-Regarding stealing and reflecting 22% thought it was important while 27.6% were neutral and 11% said no altogether.

<br><br>-Most answers involving high score table &amp; battling difficult opponents were neutral.

<br><br>-A big percentage voted toward implementing some sort of hit point system as a fourth option in battling.

<br><br>-73% of you REALLY want to bring back Defenders of Neopia!

<br><br>In conclusion,

<br><br>We hear you loud and clear battledomers! We are working with our lead programmer and QA team to hopefully get to the root of each and every issue to bring you all a better dome experience. Just note each fix is an individual issue. No issue can be fixed with one amazing magical blanket…as much as we wish it could. I'd pay millions for that blanket! But anyways just know we will do our best to find a way to the core of the Battledome code to find the best solutions feasible. Thank you for your year long waits of patience and we hope to report some changes soon

<h3><a name="stats"></a>Stat Training Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ Where do I train my Neopets? Which place is the best to train my Neopets?</b><br>
You can train your pets over at these places:<br>
- <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/academy.phtml">Cap'n Threelegs' Swashbuckling Academy</a> (Uses One, Two, and Five Dubloons and Trains Up To Level 40) <br>
- <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/training.phtml">Mystery Island Training School</a> (Uses Tan Codestones and Trains Up To Level 250)<br>
- <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/fight_training.phtml">Secret Ninja Training School</a> (Uses Red Codestones and Trains Level 250 and above)</p><p>

If you want to know which place is the best to train, then that's a matter of how much you're willing to spend. You would want to max out your stats over at the Swashbuckling Academy (Level 40 with 80 HP/STR/DEF), then hit up the Mystery Island Training School unless you don't mind paying more for Codestones and want to train faster (also actually consistent with checking in with every completed course).

</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> JN's Training Guide For Beginners<br>
battlepedia.jellyneo.net/?go=beginners_guide_to_training<br>
It's a Battledome feature that was never implemented.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neopedia/187_lesson2.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do stats work? </b><br>
It's based on certain "tier ranges" with a given multiplier of icons used for that range. You can check them out here:

</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/pteri.gif"> TDN's Stat Boost Tiers Guide<br>
thedailyneopets.com/battledome/strength-defense-boosts/</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Do I need Speed and Intelligence? </b><br>
No, because Speed and Intelligence are useless for nearly every weapon out there. Intelligence is really only practical if you want to use Crisp Blue Tunic or Heavy Blue Tunic.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/arm_blue_robe.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bva_bluetunic.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where do I obtain Codestones and Dubloons? </b><br>
You can obtain Codestones and Dubloons from dailies, Random Events, etc. Buying from usershops would be the most consistent and reliable way.</p><p>

Don't visit the Mystery Island Volcano or open Green Gift Pouches/Pouch of Dubloons for Codestones/Dubloons. It'll most likely be a loss compared to buying from usershops.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/28_eyrie_inspect.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where can I break down bigger Dubloons? This guy doesn't give change.</b><br>
You can break down Dubloons at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/restaurant.phtml">Golden Dubloon</a> (<a href="/~SparklesRoyal">~SparklesRoyal</a>) or the <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/piratepets.phtml">Little Nippers Petpet Shop.</a> If you wish to combine your dubloon for a higher denomination, then I'd visit the <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/dubloonomatic.phtml">Dubloon-O-Matic</a>. The Dubloon-O-Matic only takes in full amounts and do not give change.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ At what point is it cheaper to Level Rush towards Secret Ninja Training School? </b><br>
You should be level rushing when you hit 4-5 Tan Codestones (Level 81-100 or Level 101-120).</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Should I lab my pets for stats? </b><br>
That depends on where your stats are at currently and also personal preference. 

</p><p>The Lab Ray will greatly dimish your Level and Defense, but will make your HP skyrocket (as it will never decrease your HP). If you have already maxed out your STR/DEF and only want HP, then I'd give it a go.

</p><p>The Lab Ray will occasionally change your pet's species and color, so if you are attached to either (or if you're using a species weapon), then don't use the Lab Ray unless you don't mind the cost of changing it back.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neopedia/lab_lightning.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I heard there's free training on certain days. When are those days? </b><br>
You are able to get free training at the Swashbuckling Academy if it's your pet's Species Day, your pet's birthday if you're a Premium Member, and on Neopets's Birthday (November 15th).</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are the stat boosters any good? Which ones are the best?</b><br>
Some are pretty good while most are pretty terrible. All are pretty pricey, but if you have the NP and/or the cost of regular training is too high, then WHY NOT GIVE IT A GO! </p><center>

<br><p><b>▸ Are Fortune Cookies any good for stat training? </b><br>
They are definitely good for stat training! Faerie Quest, Lab Ray, and Training cookies are pretty beneficial, but do know that they are Neocash if you're willing to buy Neocash or NC trade for them. I personally don't use Training Cookies, because I'm forgetful and inconsistent when picking up my pets from training.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_fortcookie_4.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_fc_battledomeacademy.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_fortcookie_labray.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is it ideal to train more than one pet? </b><br>
Not really, unless that other pet is for Pet Trading or 2-Player purposes.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are there activies and items that can raise and/or lower my stats? </b><br>
Aside from INT, here's a quick list of places that can raise and/or lower your stats:<br>
- Mystery Island Training School<br>
- Secret Ninja Training School<br>
- Cap'n Threelegs' Swashbuckling Academy<br>
- Kitchen Quests<br>
- The Secret Lab Ray<br>
- Faerie Quests<br>
- Aboard the Coincidence<br>
- Coltzan's Shrine<br>
- Deadly Dice<br>
- Fruit Machine<br>
- Redeeming Space/Underwater Treasure Maps<br>
- Wheel of Extravagance<br>
- Winning certain Deserted Fairground and Terror Mountain Kiosk Scratchcards<br>
- Stat changing items<br>
- Random Events</p><p>

The best way to decrease a stat varies:<br>
- LEVEL (Deadly Dice, but it's a 50/50 to increase/decrease)<br>
- HP (Vortex Negg, but it can increase/decrease 1 HP, change your pet's color into a Basic color, or give a disease)<br>
- STR (Bullseye Potion, but it's also a chance to increase/decrease)<br>
- DEF (Lab Ray... there are no items that can decrease Defense)<br>
- SPEED (Mummified Scroll, Scroll of Hunger, and Scroll of the Warrior)<br>
- INT (Glamour Negg, Staring Negg, and Scroll Potion)<br></p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> JN's Stat Increasers Guide<br>

<br><p><b>▸ What does HSD mean? </b><br>
HSD (Health/Strength/Defense) is a term that is used for Pet Trading. To calculate HSD, you just add those three stats up together. If your STR/DEF reaches above 750, then the stats are considered at 750 each as that is the maximum stat boost for STR/DEF.</p><p>

Examples:
<br>3 HP + 5 STR + 2 DEF = 10 HSD
<br>750 HP + 750 STR + 750 DEF = 2,250 HSD
<br>750 HP + 1,000 STR (750) + 750 DEF = 2,250 HSD
<br>750 HP + 1,000 STR (750) + 1,000 DEF (750) = 2,250 HSD</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about Stat Training? </b><br>
Stat training is all about patience! You can surely train faster if you used stat boosters, but those are pretty costly and the training journey might make the effort feel more rewarding at the end.</p>

<h3><a name="obelisk"></a>The Obelisk Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ What is the Battleground Of The Obelisk? </b><br>
The <a href="//www.neopets.com/prehistoric/battleground/">Battleground of the Obelisk</a> is a fortnightly series of skirmish battles which award boons and avatars to users who joined the winning team. This part of the site started right after the events of the War for the Obelisk.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/events/war_2013.jpg"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is participating in the Obelisk worth it? Tell me more about these boons. Are they any good?</b><br>
Yes, you can win 6 avatars, and the boons available include extra bank interest, cheaper stocks and a map through the faerie caverns. You can find more about all of the boon available at Jellyneo.</p><p>

jellyneo.net/?go=battleground_of_the_obelisk</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where and how do I start participate in the Obelisk? I can't join for some reason.</b><br>
You can join right at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/prehistoric/battleground/">Battleground of the Obelisk</a> when the time comes. You will be given three different factions to choose from for the round. It's a simple two-click process, but if you do not see the option to join after the first click then I would suggest resetting your screen resolution (aka zoom to 100%).<br></p><div class="box">You can also try on a mobile device if the problem persists.<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/beQ8hs3.png"></p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ Do my pets need to be strong to get the boons? </b><br>
No, the weakest opponents are beatable by anyone. As long as you play 10 total battles (win, lose, or draw), you'll be eligible for a boon if your faction has won that round.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Do you know which side will win? </b><br>
There is no formally assured way how to determine which side will win although there are some indicators that might lean towards a certain faction of the round.</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ When does X faction come up? I haven't seen them in ages!</b><br>
Which teams are available is completely random, except that the team that won last time will not re-appear in the next round.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/awakened_aagh7l.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/brutes_syg48s.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/order_aylbt.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/seekers_slb7gh.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/sway_lyatb3.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/thieves_atyl7.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why didn't I get a trophy and/or any points for the Mysterious Obelisk - Prize Shop?</b><br>
The trophies and points for the <a href="//www.neopets.com/prehistoric/outskirts/prizes.phtml">Mysterious Obelisk - Prize Shop</a> were from the War for the Obelisk event. They are retired along with Tyrannia: Mysterious Obelisk Site Theme and the Obelisk War Veteran avatar.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about the Obelisk? </b><br>
Guilds, Petpage Predictions, and NeoBoard Predictions might not always choose the winning faction. There is no guarantee on which side will win, but it doesn't hurt to get your ten battles in no matter what happens.</p>

<h3><a name="2pleagues"></a>2P Battling Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ What is 2P Battling? </b><br>
2-Player Battling is when you're battling against another Neopets player. There aren't any prizes for 2P Battling, but it's an experience worth trying out.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/caption/sm_caption_1049.jpg"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is 2P Battling still a thing? </b><br>
Kinda, but it's not as big as it used to be. You'll still see a couple of 2P Leagues and Guilds threads over at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=10">Battledome NeoBoard Chat</a>. Some 2P battlers would be glad to help introduce you to the whole 2P scene!</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there any incentive for 2P Battling? </b><br>
You won't win any Neopoints or items by battling in 2P leagues, but you may win a user-created trophy, or you may earn a spot on a user-run leaderboard.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/gif_kass_slicer_trophy.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are 2P Leagues? </b><br>
2P Leagues are 2-Player Battles with extra rules and restrictions in order to make battles fairer and more fun. Most rules involve setting limits on a pet's stats and restrictions on usable equipment. You can find a whole listing of 2P related petpages here:

</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> Two Player Battledome Directory<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~BD2P">/~BD2P</a></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where can I find players to 2P fight? </b><br>
You can find 2P fights over at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=10">Battledome NeoBoard Chat</a> or in a Battledome Guild.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is this Foresight Glitch I'm hearing about? </b><br>
It's a glitch that allows you or your opponent to know what the other side's equipment and ability used next round will be. Most 2P Battlers are aware of this bug and greatly despise it as it ruins the spirit of the battle. A better explanation (but not instructions) about this issue can be read here:

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about 2P Battling? </b><br>
2P Battling isn't just about fighting others in leagues. You used to be able to fight a Darigan Tonu for an avatar, but now you just need to own a Darigan Tonu and fight with it. You can also use Scroll Potion to drain your friend's INT, if you really want to do that.

<h1>Customisation FAQs</h1>

<h3><a name="customisation"></a>Customisation Basics Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ What is Customization? </b><br>
Neopets Customization is one of the main creative aspects on the site! Neopians customize their pets to give them character, make them unique and out of the ordinary compared to the other pets, and sometimes just having a bare pet feels kinda empty. There are 55 different species, over 110 colors, and more than 16,500 wearables to explore!<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/clicktoplay/fg_805.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is Customization worth it? Is there a right way to customize?</b><br>
Customization is really just for fun! There is no proper way to customize. You can impress your friends, participate in customization related contests, and express your own creativity! Customization is not a necessity to enjoy or play Neopets, but it's something to try out!</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I customize my Neopets? </b><br>
You'll first want to obtain some clothing, or Wearables (these are highlighted in blue in your Inventory and also by a hanger icon in the corner of its image), and put them in your Closet. Wearables can be obtained from some Neopian Shops, Usershops, Paint Brushes, etc.</p><p>

To customize your Neopets, you would want to go to your <a href="//www.neopets.com/quickref.phtml">Quick Reference</a> (this page can be found by clicking your pet's name in the left sidebar) and click "Customise" under the desired pet's dropdown. In the customization application, all you gotta do is select the desired wearables and apply them on your pet, then save afterwards.<br><br>

If you want to go into your Active Pet's customization application immediately, you could:<br>
- Click on the "Customise" link under your pet's image in the left sidebar.<br>
- Click on the "Customise" button in the upper toolbar.<br>
- Click on the "Customise Neopet" link inside the upper toolbar under "Customise".<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/shopkeepers/4.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a way I can preview certain wearables items before obtaining them? </b><br>
You can preview wearables and plan future customizations over at any of the following certified fansites:<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/indubitably.gif"> Dress to Impress (DTI)<br>
impress.openneo.net</p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> Jellyneo's Wardrobe (JN)<br>
wardrobe.jellyneo.net/app/</p><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/sun.gif"> Sunnyneo's Wearable HQ (SN)<br>
sunnyneo.com/customisation/wearables/</p><p></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Do I need to convert my Unconverted (UC) Pet in order to customize? </b><br>
Nope! You will have restrictions on what wearables your Unconverted Pets can wear, but you are not required to convert your pets to customize them! </p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are restricted colors? </b><br>
Restricted colors are uniquely colored species that are unable to wear all the wearables due to the shape or form compared to the normal-body counterparts. The main three are Baby, Maraquan, and Mutant. All the colors include:<br>
- 8-bit (8-bit Chia, Draik, Elephante, Kyrii, and Ruki are fully customizable)<br>
- Baby<br>
- Invisble (Invisble Blumaroo, Elephante, Gelert, Jetsam, Kau, Kougra, Tonu, and Usul are fully customizable)<br>
- Maraquan (Maraquan Mynci is fully customizable)<br>
- Mutant<br>
- Origami (Origami Eyrie, Kacheek, and Moehog are fully customizable)<br>
- Fruit/Vegetable Chias<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/caption/sm_caption_958.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Presets? </b><br>
Presets are a feature in the Customization application that allows you to save your pet's customization. When you save your pet's customization with presets, the wearables will be occupied in the save file even when they are not in use. Presets are individually linked to the pet that was being customized on, and they reset if the pet is painted/morphed/transferred/abandoned.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is a Cross-Paint? </b><br>
A cross-paint is when your pet is wearing Paint Brush clothing that's not the same color of the pet, so you can pull off some pretty awesome customization combos.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HnHE542.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ektjSPH.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NxRvwCz.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ws5oUkn.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I layer multiple wearables within the same category? </b><br>
Generally, you are unable to layer multiple wearables within the same occupation. There are a couple of cases where you would be able to do that though (it's Markings mostly).</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a way I can remove a certain part of my pet's features (Ruff, Spiked Toenails, etc.)? </b><br>
Yep, there is a way to get rid of those extra features! We call these Wearable Restrictions and they are useful when removing certain pet features that might get in the way of our customization idea.</p><p>

To check out which wearables restrict a certain feature, I'd check out DTI's and JN's Wardrobe Advanced Search.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I attach Petpetpets (P3s)? It's taking forever! </b><br>
To attach Petpetpets to your Active Pet's Petpet, you will need to first obtain the Petpetpet and then refresh your inventory a lot. The Petpetpet attaching is pretty random and it might take a couple hours or longer to do. There are no items nor activities that will boost the chance of attaching the Petpetpet to your Pet's Petpet.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/msn_buddy/msn_larnikin.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where do Petpetpets (P3s) even come from? </b><br>
Petpetpets can be obtained from certain Dailies (Aboard the Coincidence and Grave Danger), Goodie Bags, and directly purchasing from other players through Shop Wizard, Trading Post, and Auctions.</p><p>

Prior 2014, Petpetpets used to be rewarded from Random Events, and were also available to purchase from the Almost Abandoned Attic. Vernax is the cheapest Petpetpet for that was given out in 2009's Games Master Challenge.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I remove my Petpetpet (P3s) from my Pet's Petpet? </b><br>
You can remove a Petpetpet from your Pet's Petpet, but they will permanently disappear afterward. If you do wish to remove your Petpetpet, then all you have to do is remove your Petpet from your Pet, so think carefully before attaching. Also, if your Petpet is permanently deleted from the Petpet Lab Ray and it did have a Petpetpet, the Petpetpet will also be deleted.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/petpet_stolen.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Fansite Modeling? </b><br>
Fansite Modeling is when you are submitting customization data to certified fansites that specialize in previewing wearables such as Dress to Impress and Jellyneo's Wardrobe. It's really just inputting a pet's name that's wearing a new wearable or showing a new colored species, so that everyone can have the chance to play and plan with those customization specialities in the future. DTI and Jellyneo do have a leaderboard of modeling, and Jellyneo's Wardrobe does award their own site trophies for helping out!

</p><p>Fansite wearable modeling is a vital part of these fansites and those contributions do support the customization community! </p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> Modeling Guide<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Draconianism">/~Draconianism</a></p>

<br><p><b>▸ DTI lied to me said that my pet can wear X (or that X wearable looks different on-site)! Why is this?</b><br>
There are a couple items that might be deceitful on Dress to Impress because of how the occupations are (or something funky going on TNT's end that can be cross-referenced from "Why can't my pet wear X wearable?).</p><p>

This tends to happen with non-bodily occupying wearables that are for pets with a restricted color (Baby in a Pumpkin, Baby Sleigh with Raindorfs, etc.) and non-bodily occupying wearables with multiple models (Dug up Dirt Foreground, Living in Watermelon Foreground and Background, etc.).</p><p> DTI's code doesn't really vibe with that and we discovered that this too was tedious to fix. We'd recommended to check out Jellyneo's Wardrobe for accuracy if you are unsure.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about customization? </b><br>
If you ever need advice on how to get started with customization, what wearables might work well with your customization ideas, or something else not mentioned here, then I would try asking the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=25">Customization NeoBoard Chat</a> (and also the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=31">NC Mall NeoBoard Chat</a> for possibly faster response if customizing with Neocash is okay).</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> Jellyneo's Customization Articles and Guides<br>

<h3><a name="customisationoopsies"></a>Customisation Errors Related</h3>

<p><b>▸ Why is my pet a cog/gear? </b><br>
This usually happens when Neopets is lagging pretty hard on their end or some other problem on-site. If the reason is site lag, you could fix this by recustomizing your Neopet by adding or removing a wearable. You could also wait it out until it fixes itself too.</p><p>

If it happens to be one of the reasons below, those problems cannot be fixed until TNT does something about it:<br>
- It's a 8-bit Wocky (certain image sizes) or Maraquan Wocky (certain image sizes).<br>
- It's an unavailable colored species combination (Grápe Lutari, MSP Hissi, etc.).<br>
- It's wearing a newer wearable (2019-present, fixes itself reasonably quick or when mentioned in the Editorial).<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/2249.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why can't my pet wear X wearable? </b><br>
This can be for a variety of reasons!<br>
- You have an item already occupying and/or restricting that wearable zone.<br> 
- If the wearable has a shadowed highlight, it means it's currently being worn another pet or in Presets.<br>
- If your pet is a Vandagyre, wearables released prior November 15, 2014 cannot be worn with that species.<br>
- The wearable was designed for a specific species or restricted color (8-bit, Baby, Maraquan, Mutant, Pea, etc.).<br>
- If your pet is a newer restricted color, wearables released prior cannot be worn with that species.<br>
- If the wearable is in the Biology Effects occupation, Unconverted pets cannot wear the item (Static Occupation will make them appear Invisible).<br>
- The wearable is broken (but this only really happens with newer wearables and gets fixed within a week or two unless forgotten or is purposely avoided until hit by the Editorial).<br>
- The wearable is too funky and has been recorded here:</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ I just zapped my pet and their wearables are gone! Why is that? </b><br>
If your pet zapped into a restricted color or different species while wearing clothing that is not compatible with the current colored species, then you are most likely facing an invisible wearable problem. You do still have the items in your Closet as the problem is that you can't remove them regularly as before. You can put the wearables back into your closet by one of these methods:<br>
- Abandoning your pet (and quickly adopting back hopefully)<br>
- Morphing your pet<br>
- Zapping your pet to a compatible color or species<br>
- Sending a Support Ticket<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/82_lupe_lab.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I just transferred my pet and their wearables are gone! Why is that? </b><br>
The Neopoint wearables and/or Paint Brush clothing are still there, you just have to re-customize your pet. Neocash, No-Trade, and Paint Brush clothing that were not the same color of the pet would all not transfer over. </p>

<br><p><b>▸ I didn't get a new set of Paint Brush after morphing my pet. Why is that? </b><br>
If your pet matches the same color and species of the morphing potion used, you will not receive a new set of Paint Brush clothing if applicable, so might as well use a Turnip Tonic prior to morphing the pet. </p>

<br><p><b>▸ I recently did a transfer and it took away the clothing! It wasn't even on, so why did that happen?</b><br>
Yeah, the Paint Brush clothing of that specified colored species will transfer even if it wasn't used on the pet directly (i.e. on another pet or in your closet). In the event you have multiple sets of the Paint Brush clothing, it will randomly take a set from either location the set resides on.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Sometimes the facial/biological parts of my pet change from-to-time. Do you what's up with that? </b><br>
Now I call this a dithering model issue (Colored Unis with regular horns, Grey Draks with different Eyes/Mouths, etc.). Some colored species have dithering appearances in which they would often have multiple sets of the same emotion model. This cannot be controlled whatsoever and changes sporadically. TNT have fixed some dithering model issues in the past, but I would assume that this is not their priority anymore.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IX96isx.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1rOLEQE.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about Customization Errors? </b><br>
Customization errors are really prominent in the Beta application, but most wearable/pet models should fine in the Static preview even if they're not viewable in the Beta application. It doesn't hurt to send in a ticket to try to get a pet and/or item model fixed, but if it's a zone change, then you might want to discuss that on the NeoBoards first for a communal agreement.</p>


<h3><a name="customisationcontest"></a>Customisation Contest Related</h3>

<p><b>▸ What is the Customization Spotlight? </b><br>
The <a href="//www.neopets.com/spotlights/custompet/index.phtml">Customisation Spotlight</a> is where members can showcase their pets' customizations in hopes of a trophy and personal clout. The contest is divided into two sections being Neopoint items only and Neocash items included.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/trophies/trophy_custompet_1.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/trophies/trophy_custompet_2.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/trophies/trophy_custompet_3.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is Customization Spotlight rigged? </b><br>
In a way, yes it is according to their social media 20th Anniversary Q&amp;A:</p><div class="box"><p><strong>Q: How are customization spotlight winners chosen? 
</strong><br>
A: We take your votes &amp; look at the top entries, &amp; we choose what we like based on that. Other times we choose whichever doesn't matter their rank. In essence, there is no method to the madness it's mostly random.</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a way how I can view specific Customization Spotlight entries? </b><br>
There is no way to directly view a specific Customization Spotlight entry. Entries were told to be randomized for everyone per day.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why can't I enter my pet into Customization Spotlight? </b><br>
If your pet is not wearing any wearables, was previously Gold Banned prior, or is colored Invisible, it cannot enter in the Customization Spotlight. TNT has said in the past that they'll consider allowing Invisible pets in the future though.</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 793 | Question 6 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=793">link</a>]<p>
<strong> Hey there, Scrappy! I was wonderin' why Invisible pets are not allowed entry into the Cusomization Spotlight? In my (not so humble) opinion, some of the VERY best customizations are on invisible pets! If it is a bug, would you please whisper in the right someone's ear and get the bug squished? :D Thank you for lookin' into it! Cheers!<p></p></strong>
</p><p>Hey! Don't look at me! There is a certain TNTer that has a slight fear of those invisible pets and refuses to include them! We're working on that fear though...</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ Why does it say another pet submitted the same outfit as mine in the Customization Spotlight? </b><br>
You probably clicked too fast when entering. Your entries should be fine.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/template_images/sloth_rolling_robo.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why are there only two placed winners Customization Spotlight this week? </b><br>
The owner of the winning pet that week most likely got frozen/suspended. Why doesn't TNT just pick the next top pet, we dunno fam, we just don't know.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Gold Bans? Are Gold Bans still a thing in Customization Spotlight? </b><br>
Gold Bans are when you win first place and you are not allowed to enter that pet for a specified amount of time (just like in the Beauty Contest). They are still a thing in the Customization Spotlight and they last for two months.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/clicktoplay/screenshot_thumbnail_38_1_v1.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about the Customization Spotlight? </b><br>
Even though it's clearly rigged, it doesn't hurt to try every now and again if you're wanting the Customization Spotlight trophy. It's more important to be consistent than to not try at all.</p>

<h3><a name="neohomes"></a>Neohomes Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ Do people still make Neohomes? Is it worth it? </b><br>
Surprisingly, there is a small group of players that still decorate their Neohomes! There is no real benefit or detriment to making a Neohome (well, maybe if you want to get rid of the Newbies sidebar and also get the Robo avatar).<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/133_energetic_poogle.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the difference between Classic Neohomes and Neohomes 2.0? </b><br>
Classic Neohome is the original Neohome format. You start out with picking which Neopian land you'd like to be in can then start renovating to your heart's content! Constructing more rooms, gardens, and interior designs do require an extra fee (and wait time), but this version does include the most amount of Neohome items to play around with. You can only unlock the Robo Avatar through the Classic Neohome.</p><p>

Neohomes 2.0 (or V2) is the newest Neohome format. The navigation is easy to explore and visuals are more appealing. You can choose which Neopian land you would like to create your Neohome in (although choose wisely, as you cannot change locations) and you are given a set amount of both outdoor and living space. While this does mean there is a limited amount of space you can mess around with, this also means there are no additional fees or wait times in terms of renovating your Neohome. Neohomes 2.0 does have fewer Neohome items variety, but as a perk, you can place your Neopets in the homes!</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How much do Neohomes cost? </b><br>
Building a Neohome is free! Expanding and obtaining furniture/gardening supplies are not, so have fun!

</p><br><p><b>▸ How do I make walls? </b><br>
There are no actual wall furniture items, but the Neohome community has found that Chalkboards and Cylara Posters are affordable and decent substitute for making walls in your Neohome 2.0. Almost everything can be used as a wall in the Classic Neohome.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/fur_chalkboard.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/fur_cylara_poster.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Do items have to be used just as they are named? </b><br>
No, items can be used creatively to build all kinds of exciting images, in both versions of Neohomes! Castles, pirate ships, paintings, monsters - the sky isn't even the limit. You can build an outer space image if you want to.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a way I can preview certain Neohome Items? </b><br>
There is no application to plan a design for your Neohome, but you can preview certain Neohome Items over at Jellyneo's Item Database and also this page: </p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> Secret3191's Museum (Classic Neohome)<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Korazee">/~Korazee</a></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I delete my Neohome? </b><br>
You can delete your Classic Neohome, but you can neither delete nor change the location of your Neohome 2.0.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are Neohome Spotlight and Notable Neohome still a thing? </b><br>
Nope x2. They stopped Neohome Spotlight and the Notable Neohome showcases have been there for years.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/147_pets_neohomeburn.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why can't I take out my NC Neohome items out of my Storage Shed? </b><br>
It's a known bug that Neocash Neohome items cannot be removed from the Storage Shed. TNT has not discussed this problem in the Editorial and we assume that this is not a priority fix for them.

</p><br><p><b>▸ What do Neohome Extensions do? </b><br>

<h1>Exploring Neopia FAQs</h1>

<p><b>▸ Why does the Neopia Central Map not load the Movie Central sometimes? </b><br>
To this day, we don't know why the Movie Central randomly appears and disappears. None of the movie posters will appear, but you can still feed your pets and play the games there if they are available.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/sp_pinkpopcorn.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What's up with the Keep Out! sign in Krawk Island? </b><br>
We don't know for sure what its purpose is supposed to be as it is not being used for anything. In terms of lore, there are assumptions that after the events of the Disappearance of Krawk Island, that this is the home of the Krawk Island citizens that did not agree with Governor Gavril McGill's policies.</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> Timeline of Neopia

<br><p><b>▸ Is TNT ever bringing back Lutari Island? </b><br>
It was mentioned in the Editorial that a TNT staff member truly desired to bring back Lutari Island, but stated that they couldn't do the job. In the End of Flash Update video, two TNT staff members stated that bringing back Lutari Island was not entirely impossible to do in the future.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/paintbrush_lutari_island.gif"></p>

- Royal Astronomer Site Event Trophy<br>
- Lenny - Finneus Avatar<br>

<br><p><b>▸ Does the Altador Mini-Plot work with the new HTML5 map?</b><br>
The Altador Mini-Plot does in fact work with the new map! If for whatever reason the map does not work for you, then here are the following links to the unmarked areas on the main map:<br>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I participate in the Altador Mini-Plot on my side account? </b><br>
You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to participate in the Altador Mini-Plot on your side accounts.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Do I really need to click every submit and leave button? </b><br>
Yes, you really do need to click every submit and leave button in order to progress through the Mini-Plot.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do you find constellations? Is it the same for everyone?</b><br>
They are not the same for everyone and you can find your constellation locations from the following resources below: <img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/pteri.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/sun.gif"><br>

<br><p><b>▸ How do you heal the Vaeolus? I've been at this for three hours.</b><br>
Aside from finding your constellations, the Vaeolus activity has to be one of most complicated roadblocks in the Altador Mini-Plot. You are going to have to be consistent with the timing for every minute per action (Bandage, Feed, Medicine, or Wait), then you would immediately check up on the petpet. For example:</p><p>

12:01:00 → Action<br>
12:02:02 → Check Up<br>
12:02:05 → Action</p><p>

I would say TDN has the best walkthrough for this activity.</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do fix the Water Plant? I've been at this for four hours.</b><br>
The Water Plant's configurations are random for everyone, but TDN and SunnyNeo both have individual guides on how to tackle the 254 possible combinations. There is one combination that you should avoid (don't worry if you hit do it though), and that is turning on all the wheels and levers as that will <a href="//images.neopets.com/altador/plant/altador_flooded_omg_8e25c919b0.gif">flood Altador</a>.</p><p>

<h3><a name="moltara"></a> Atlas of the Ancients Related</h3>
<p></p><p><b>▸ Is the Atlas of the Ancients plot still active?</b><br>
Nah fam, it started and ended in 2009 (Y11). However, you can still get free items from it.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/aota_news.jpg"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is collecting all the Moltara Worms worth it? </b><br>
If you want the experience and the <i>glory</i> of being able to say you've done it, sure. Otherwise, it can be a pretty significant time investment to wait for all the worms to show up, especially the black and rainbow ones which are known to be particularly elusive, only showing up for a specified 5 minute time interval at a time each day. The times and total amount of worm appearences are different for everyone, so you might want to record the times you find them!<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mw_blackworm.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/gwl_empty_lantern.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/gwl_dark_lantern.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/gwl_bright_lantern.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mw_rainbowworm.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is it worth the time creating all the petpets at Tangor's Workshop?</b><br>
 Again, if you want to do it for the <i>experience</i>, go ahead. Ain't nobody stoppin' ya. But honestly it's much more efficient time-wise to just buy them from other users.</p><p>

jellyneo.net/?go=tangorsworkshop</p>

<br><p><b>▸ So, where do I get Scrap Metal and Stone and Red Moltite? </b><br>
Scrap Metal and Stone used to be available via a random event while in Moltara, but that event seems to have gone MIA. Red Moltite can be found organically by gathering up all ten worms and exploring the <a href="//www.neopets.com/magma/darkcave.phtml">Dark Cave</a>. Both can be found in user shops if you really want to craft the petpets yourself, or if you need them for some other reason.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mmat_scrap.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mmat_moltite.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I was feeling nostalgic and got a free item from the Atlas of the Ancients comic! Are there any related freebies left for me to grab? </b><br>
Freebies from the comic include Ancient Map of Neopia, Wind Up Pocket Watch, Shiny Mechanical Faerie Fountain, Mysterious Orchid, Steam Horn, and Mechanical Molla Flower. See Jellyneo's guide for specific instructions on how to obtain them. You can also visit the <a href="//www.neopets.com/magma/quarry.phtml">Obsidian Quarry</a> daily for a free Shiny Obsidian.</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is and how do I acess the Magma Pool?</b><br>
Guarded by a Magma Tonu, the <a href="//www.neopets.com/magma/pool.phtml">Magma Pool</a> is a place where you can dip your Neopets into the lava rock color, Magma. There exists two methods of getting Magma Pool access:</p><p>

- The first method is to visit the Magma Pool Guard when he is asleep. He takes a ten minute nap at the same time every day (it's a different time for everyone). You are allowed to do this method on your side accounts, however do know that you are only permitted to dip your pets once per week. <br>
- The other method is when the Magma Pool Guard deems you worthy to dip in the Magma Pool. This method grants you permanent access and allows you to visit the Magma Pool at any time. It is not entirely known, but we were informed that it requires obtaining NP/NP items, so that one is not allowed to be done on side accounts. </p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about the Atlas of the Ancients? </b><br>
AotA is generally regarded as the worst plot by most players, being little more than a point-and-click exercise combined with a Daily Dare-esque element (achieve x score in y game to receive z prize). It had a Neocash component as well, something that wasn't looked kindly upon at the time. This plot spawned the knockoff games Clara on Ice (Let It Slide), Tunnel Tumble (Darigan Dodgeball), Moltara Run (Volcano Run II), Clockwork Codebreaker (untimed Time Tunnel), as well as the new games Cloud Raider and Cave Glider.

</p><p>Most importantly, it led to a new land and pet color - Moltara and magma, respectively - being revealed, which was pretty cool.</p>

<h1>Guilds / Questing FAQs</h1>

<h3><a name="guilds"></a>Guild Basics Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ Where are the guilds and what are they? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/guilds/index.phtml">Guilds</a> are special interest clubs that you can create/join to meet other players with similar likes and dislikes. You can find new friends and chat about your favorite things. To get to the Guilds page, click on 'Shops' in the yellow toolbar. When the shops page loads, click on the 'Guilds' link in the toolbar.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/community/hub/guilds.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the purpose of guilds? </b><br>
Guilds are just special interest clubs that anyone can join. There is no real advantage or disadvantage if you decide not to join a guild. You can find new friends with the same interests as you (e.g Skating, Chias, Drawing), and you can normally find a lot of people to practice within the Battledome.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I create a guild? </b><br>
To start your own guild go to the Guilds page and press <a href="//www.neopets.com/guilds/create_guild.phtml">Create a New</a>. To get to the Guilds page, click on 'Shops' in the yellow toolbar. When the shops page loads, click on the 'Guilds' link in the toolbar. (It is a blue/green castle). Remember you can only create or join one guild so choose wisely.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/103_guild_headquaters.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I join a guild? </b><br>
When you have found the guild you want to join, go to the guild page. You should see a 'Join Guild' link under the 'Options' header along the left. Click that link and you will become a member of that guild.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I get to my guild? </b><br>
To get to your guild, click on 'Shops' then click on the 'Guilds' link. Once the Guild main page loads, click on the 'Teleport' link in the toolbar. This will take you directly to your guild.<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"><i>NOTE: You have to be a member of a guild for this to work!</i></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I leave a guild? </b><br>
If you don't want to be part of a guild anymore, it is very easy to leave. Just go to the main Guilds Page and enter the guild you belong to. At the very bottom of the options (in the sidebar of the guild) is a 'leave guild' button. Once you click that you are no longer a part of that guild.</p><p>

If you are the Guild Leader, you will not have the option of leaving. You would have to actually delete the guild. We will be working on a feature that will allow the Guild Leader to resign and appoint someone else into their place.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/template_images/millipod_green_walk.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I delete a guild? </b><br>
If you have accidentally created a guild you can delete it but first you need to remove all your members. To do this go back to your guild page and click on Guild Members. This will display a list of all the members. To remove someone click on their UN and then select delete member. You need to do this for all your members and then the delete guild option will appear.</p><p>

You are not allowed to delete a guild that has multiple members, so the members must leave or be removed before you will have the option of deleting the guild.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I change the location of my guild? </b><br>
Unfortunately, once you have created a guild you cannot change its location or neighbourhood.

</p><br><p><b>▸ What are private guilds? </b><br>
Private guilds are guilds that are not listed in the Guild neighbourhoods. The only way to become a member of a private guild is if you receive an official Guild Invitation and you click on the link provided to you.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/234_grarrl_mail.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What options do I have when I create a guild? </b><br>
When you are creating your new guild, you have quite a few options to choose from.</p><p>

- <strong>Guild Neighbourhood</strong><br>
There are many neighbourhoods that you can choose from, and each neighbourhood has a unique theme. Try to choose a neighbourhood that will best suit your guild's theme.</p><p>

- <strong>Guild Description</strong><br>
This will be the text along the top of your guild. The description is placed along the top of your guild as a brief intro to what your guild is about. The description is also used when searching for guilds, so make sure that it is something catchy.</p><p>

- <strong>Guild Welcome</strong><br>
This is the welcome message that is displayed when a user goes to your guild's front page. Use this area to update members to new events, news, etc.</p><p>

- <strong>Guild Privacy</strong><br>
You have the option of making your guild public or private. If you choose to make your guild private, then it will not show up when users are searching the the guild neighbourhoods. You will have to invite members directly in order for them to get to your guild.</p><p>

- <strong>Guild Colours</strong><br>
You can customise all of the colours used for your guild layout. This includes the text and border colours. Try creating a colour scheme using the drop down boxes and then click on Preview. This will open a new window showing you how your colour scheme would look. If you don't like the colour scheme, simply try changing the colours and clicking on Preview until you are happy with the colour scheme.


</p><br><p><b>▸ How do I change the appearance of my guild? </b><br>
Once you have created your own guild, you can change its appearance whenever you wish. This includes the colour scheme, welcome message and guild logo. To change the welcome message (the main page people see when they come to your guild) first go to your guild. At the bottom of the sidebar is a section called 'Admin'. Click on 'Guild Layout'. You now have three options. The first will change your guild appearance. The second will let you change the names of the positions in your guild. The last one will let you upload/change your logo.</p><p>

Click on 'Modify Guild Preferences'. Now you can enter a new description and welcome message. You can also choose to make your guild private or not. If you choose to make your guild private, it can only be seen by invited players and won't appear in the guild search. You can also change the colour scheme by selecting different colours from the drop down menus.</p><p>

Once you have finished making your changes, click on the 'Submit Changes' button. Your changes should now be saved. You many need to refresh the page to see the changes.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I promote/demote guild members? </b><br>
To promote or demote a guild member, click on the 'Guild Members' link under the 'Admin' header. That will pull up a list of all of the members in the guild. To choose a member, simply click on their name. That will pull up an options page which will allow you to modify their current rank and status. Using the drop down menu, select the rank that wish to give them and then click on 'Update Member'!<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bvs_scrollof_virtue.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I suspend a member from my guild? </b><br>
Yes. To suspend a member, click on the 'Guild Members' link under the 'Admin' header. That will pull up a list of all of the members in the guild. To choose a member, simply click on their name. That will pull up an options page which will allow you to modify their current rank and status. To suspend them, simply place a check in the 'Suspend Member' option and click on 'Update Member'! The member will be placed on suspension, which will stop them using the message board, calendar and photo gallery sections. To remove the suspension, simply follow the same steps again and choose 'Reinstate Member.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I remove a member from the guild? </b><br>
Yes. To delete a member, click on the 'Guild Members' link under the 'Admin' header. That will pull up a list of all of the members in the guild. To choose a member, simply click on their name.

</p><br><p><b>▸ Can I block a user from rejoining a guild? </b><br>
Yes. To block a user, click on the Guild Members link under the 'Admin' header. That will pull up a list of all of the members in the guild. To choose a member, simply click on their name. That will pull up an options page which will allow you to modify their current rank and status. To block the member, simply place a check in the Block User option and click on Update Member! The member will then be removed from the guild and they will be prohibited from rejoining.

</p><br><p><b>▸ What is a the guild council? </b><br>
The guild council, is a list of a few trusted people who are given certain duties to maintain the guild. What these duties are, depends on what the guild leader wants them to do. Each council member can have certain permissions such as the ability to clear message boards, although this is up to the guild leader to give them out.</p><p>

There are four positions other than the guild leader, the names are up to the guild leader to create. The guild leader is the founder of the guild. He or she always has the final say on how the guild will operate.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/boo_only_the_best.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I apply for a position on the council? </b><br>
The guild leader can promote members to an open position on the guild council or guild members can place an application for an open guild position by clicking on the 'Apply For Position' link under the Guild Council header. The guild leader can then review the application and accept or reject it accordingly. If you do not see a link to apply for a position, then there are no available council positions at that time.

</p><br><p><b>▸ Who has guild admin capabilities? </b><br>
By default, only the guild leader (founder) and the person appointed by the guild leader as the guild master will have admin capabilities. Although, the guild founder can also assign (and remove) admin privileges to any member he/she deems fit. The admin powers are organised as follows:</p><p>

- <strong>Layout Control</strong><br>
The ability to change the guild description, welcome message, guild logo and many other layout attributes such as the guild colours and guild hierarchy. This is a very powerful position and should only be appointed to those that you trust completely.</p><p>

- <strong>Member Admin</strong><br>
The ability to change a member's rank and other member status values. This is also a very powerful position, as a person with this admin power can also suspend, delete and permanently block a user from the guild!</p><p>

- <strong>Council Admin</strong><br>
The ability to monitor all of the applications sent in for guild council positions. This power allows the member to accept and reject any applications that have been submitted.</p><p>

- <strong>Board Monitor</strong><br>
The ability to monitor the guild message boards. This admin power allows the user to delete messages from the board, as well as, utilize the admin features for the message boards (multiple deletes).</p><p>

- <strong>Calendar Admin</strong><br>
The ability to monitor the guild calendar events. This admin power allows the user to delete any events from the guild calendar.

</p><br><p><b>▸ How can I customise the guild council position names? </b><br>
To customize your guild layout, click on the 'Guild Layout' link under the 'Admin' header. From there, you can click on Modify Guild Preferences. This page will allow you to modify the description, welcome message, privacy status and all of the colour choices for your guild. Once you have made all of the desired modifications, simply click on 'Submit Changes.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I review applications for the guild council? </b><br>
To review applications submitted by guild members for council positions, simply click on the 'Guild Council' link under the 'Admin' header. If there are any new applications, they will be listed on this page. To review a specific application, simply click on the member's name that you wish to review. This will pull up the application submitted, which includes their current position in the guild, and the position they are applying for. If you wish to accept their application, simply click on 'Accept' and they will be promoted to their new council position. If you click 'Reject', then it will remove their application and they will not be promoted.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/324_moehog_zafara.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Messages keep disapeering from my guild, yet I am not deleting them, why is this? </b><br>
If a person posts a particularly bad message, we will send them an official warning and delete all the messages that person has posted, this includes guilds and noticeboard posts.</p><p>

Also we periodically clear old messages from guild boards. We have to do this now and again to make sure they don't get overloaded.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why can't we have chats in our shops or guilds? </b><br>
Unmonitored, live chats are against Neopets terms and conditions. We cannot control what is said in them, or ensure our players safety when using them. As there are some very nasty people out there, we cannot permit them to be used.

</p><br><p><b>▸ How do I organise a guild donation? </b><br>
If you want to do a guild giveaway, you simply need to decide on a date when as many guild members as possible will be able to help out. Start storing up items and promote your giveaway on the messageboards and noticeboards.

When it comes to the big day, just start giving away those items in the Money Tree and grateful Neopians will flock to see what is on offer. While you are doing the giveaway, keep reminding people via the Guild board.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/122_oldusul_donate.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I invite members to my guild? </b><br>
If your guild is private, or if you want to directly invite a member, you can do so by entering the prospective member's UN on the Guild Invite page. This will send the user a Neomail with a link to your guild.</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> NOTE: The guild invite link will need to be copied and pasted into the invited user's browser. The direct link in the Neomail will give an error.</p><p>

Under Guild Preferences, there is an option to restrict guild invitations to guild admin only. If this is enabled, members without this privilege will not be able to send guild invites.</p><p>

Guild invites are only valid for a limited time before they expire and have to be resent. Additionally, only users who have Guild Invites activated in their user preferences can receive an invite.</p><p>

<br></p><p><b>▸ What is a Guild Mailer and how do I send one to my guild members? </b><br>
A guild mailer is a message that is sent through Neomail to all members of a guild. You can use this feature to send out guild announcements, updates, or any sort of information to your guild members who have this feature active in their user preferences.</p><p>

To send a guild mailer, a member needs to have been assigned the admin privilege. If you have this privilege, you'll be able to select "My Guild Members" from the drop-down menu when you create a new Neomail. This will display "@guild_list" in recipient box.</p><p>

Occasionally, a red message will state that guild mailing is offline. You won't be able to send out a guild message during that time, but make sure to check back at a later time. There is no schedule as to when guild mailing is down.</p><p>

When guild mailing is ónlíné you may need to refresh the page a couple of times before you see the textbox appear. Remember, this will send a message to all members of your guild who have Guild Mailing activated in their user preferences.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/450_weewoo_desk.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ A large amount of messages were deleted from the Guild Stats? </b><br>
You may notice hundreds--or even thousands--of messages deleted from your Guild's stat count. This is a known occurance. Some guilds choose to list the deleted message count on their website, though, of course, this is only provided as an estimate.</p><p>

Example:<br>
Guild Stats<br>
Page Views: 104274<br>

<br></p><p><b>▸ What is a "guild account" and is it against the rules? </b><br>
A guild account is a side account created by a member of a guild--likely a council member--to represent the guild on the boards, open a guild shop or gallery, and more importantly, host extra guild pages. Though, it isn't necessary for a guild to operate a guild account.</p><p>

If a guild chooses to have a guild account, remember that it is considered a side account and may only be accessed by one person. All rules governing side accounts must be followed by the user operating the guild account.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/boo_history_of_disclaimers.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is a "guild donation shop" and is it against the rules? </b><br>
A guild donation shop is just a regular shopfront with a few differences. A guild can utilize a donation shop to acquire NPs from guild members to make purchases on behalf of the guild. An example might be using shop donations in order for the guild account to purchase a Faerie Queen Doll to lend to members.</p><p>

As of NT Issue 843, guild donation shops are allowed--though it must be operated solely for the benefit of the guild, and not the user hosting the shop. The shop doesn't have to be operated on a guild account, though, many guilds choose that option.</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> NOTE: A guild may only operate one guild shop. Additionally, it isn't allowed to require or pressure a guild member to make donations. Deciding to donate to the guild shop should be entirely optional.

</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 843 | Question 1 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=843">link</a>]<p>
The Winds are changing...</p><p>

So you know that rule where we don't allow tournaments/contests in guilds? Well, let's forget that, shall we? From this point on, guild-based contests and tournaments are permitted.</p><p>

This of course brings up the question of guild donation shops. These are also allowed with the understanding that ALL donations are given back to their respective guild members and not the person running the shop. The guild donation shop (one per guild, please!) does not have to be on the guild founders account but should be on the Guild Council so it's more official. Requiring donations (?!?) and/or fees to join a contest or tournament are still not allowed. Lastly, the guild shop account should only be accessed by the person who created that account.</p><p>

Joining different guilds on side accounts is absolutely fine. All we ask is that you only have one account per guild.</p><p>

Overall, please abide by the spirit of the rules. And if you run a tournament, please see it through!</p><p>

In the future, we will be working on a tool to make this easily manageable. But we're getting ahead of ourselves ;)</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ Is my guild allowed to host events and award prizes? </b><br>
Similar to guild donation shops, the rules regarding guild events and prizes have changed as of NT Issue 843. Guilds are now allowed to host events which award prizes--though only guild members are allowed to receive the prizes, and only on their main accounts.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/caption/sm_caption_607.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about Guilds? </b><br>
It is completely fine if you do not wish to be in a Guild. Guilds are optional and not necessary to have fun on Neopets.

</p><h3><a name="neopiaquests"></a>Quests of Neopia Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ What are Taelia/Snow Faerie Quests? Are they worth it?</b><br>
Taelia the Snow Faerie is in need of some food items, but due to the harsh weather of Terror Mountain, she will ask you to go fetch the items. In return for helping her, she will award you with an avatar, some moderately low valued items, Neopoints, the ability to fight her in the Battledome, and a chance for an exclusive item themed to her or an Ice Cream Cart coupon.</p><p>

You can do a total of ten Taelia Quests per day, but do know that Edna and Kitchen Quests are included in the daily ten quests. A failed Taelia Quest does not get counted for your daily ten quests. You cannot start a quest if you have 60+ items in your Inventory.</p><p>

Most people tend to stop fulfilling her quests once they've received the avatar. Her quests are not really profitable and the chance for an exclusive item is so significantly scarce that it does not make up the cost from continuous questing. If you do happen to receive an Ice Cream Cart coupon, there are a couple of pricey ice cream items to try your luck at.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/taelia.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Does Taelia/Snow Faerie Quests still give out Draik Eggs? </b><br>
Nope, TNT got rid of that. She also used to give out high rarity Battledome weapons, but that also has been removed from her quests.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Brain Tree Quests? Are they worth it?</b><br>
In the depths of the Haunted Woods, there lies a big spooky nerd tree that will quiz you on the deceased. The Brain Tree will ask you for the answers and you will need to feed the Esophagor twice in order to get those answers. In solving his question, he will award you with an item, Neopoints, and the ability to fight him in the Battledome. There is also a High Score Table for the amount of NP earned and placing in the top 50 for that will reward a different avatar.</p><p>

You can only do one Brain Tree Quest per day. A failed Brain Tree quest does count for that one quest per day.

</p><p>Most people do Brain Tree Quests for the avatar and then quit right after, because most of his rewards are pretty terrible. There are two Brain Tree items, Brains a la Tree and Brain Tree Knife, that are worth a quite a bit, but they are extremely rare to get.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/braintree.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Esophagor Quests? Are they worth it?</b><br>
The Esophagor is some sort of monster that's known for his massive appetite and proficiency on Brain Tree trivia. He'll request you for low rarity Spooky Food and in return will reward you with a random item that is r89 or below.</p><p>

You can do a total of ten Esophagor Quests per day and failing a quest does not count for one of your daily ten quests. Also, completing an Esophagor quest for the Brain Tree answers does not count towards the total, but you wont receive any additional rewards other than the answer for these. You cannot start a quest if you have 60+ items in your Inventory.</p><p>

Aside from the Brain Tree Quests, you should never do an Esophagor Quest as they will almost always result in a loss of Neopoints. Spooky Food has gotten pretty expensive due to the Brain Tree's High Score Table avatar.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/halloween/esophagor1.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can't I just guess the answer for the Brain Tree and still get the reward? </b><br>
Nope! You have to complete two of the Esophagor's quests in order to complete a Brain Tree Quest. If the Esophagor's requested items are too expensive for you, you can fail that quest and do another quest later. A failed Esophagor quest does not count as one your daily 10 Esophagor Quests per day. </p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I check back with the Esophagor if I forgot the answer? </b><br>
Unfortunately, the Esophagor will not repeat the answers for the Brain Tree's quest even after being fed again. He won't even reward you with his regular rewards until you complete/fail the Brain Tree's quest.</p><p>

If you happen to forget the answers, SunnyNeo has a compiled list of possible Brain Tree answers here:<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/sun.gif"> sunnyneo.com/braintree.php</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How are points rewarded for the Brain Tree High Score Table? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/gamescores.phtml?game_id=75">The Brain Tree High Score Table</a> is based off the amount of Neopoints earned from completing his quests. The NP amount earned is completely random and there is nothing you can do to increase it aside from attempting again.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/75_1.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/75_2.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/75_3.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Kitchen Quests? Are they worth it?</b><br>
Some time after the events of the Destruction of Maraqua on August 17th, 2001, the <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/kitchen.phtml">Underwater Chef</a> was washed ashore on Mystery Island and now works for Mumbo Pango as his personal chef. Due to the nature of Mumbo Pango's <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/mumbo.phtml">massive</a> appetite, Underwater Chef needs you help on gathering food items for his fancy dishes. By completing his quests, he will reward you with Neopoints, an item reward, or a stat boost (Level, HP, Strength, Defense, or Speed) to a random pet. The item reward has the chance of being an exclusive Kitchen Quest item.</p><p>

You can do a total of ten Kitchen Quests per day, but do know that Edna and Taelia Quests are included in the daily ten quests. A failed Kitchen Quest does not get counted for your daily ten quests. You cannot start a quest if you have 60+ items in your Inventory.</p><p> 

You aren't here for the item nor Neopoints rewards, but you are here for the possible stat boosts as they're pretty decent when training one pet. It is not recommended to do Kitchen Quests when you have multiple pets on your main account as the stats rewards are randomly given out to one of your pets. Also, don't do the expensive quests that request items such as Neggs, Bag of Peanuts, etc.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/shopkeepers/water_chef.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Edna Quests? Are they worth it?</b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/witchtower.phtml">Inside the Witch's Tower</a>, there is a spooky Zafara sorceress by the name of Edna and she wants your help on making a new spell. She will request various low rarity items and in return, she will reward you with a small amount of Neopoints (85 - 263 NP), a random low rarity Spooky Food item, and the ability to fight her in the Battledome. </p><p>

You can do a total of ten Edna Quests per day, but do know that Kitchen and Taelia Quests are included in the daily ten quests. A failed Edna Quest does not get counted for your daily ten quests. You cannot start a quest if you have 60+ items in your Inventory and she is not in the tower during Noon - 1PM NST as she is power napping in that time.</p><p>

Aside from the avatar, you should never do an Edna Quest as they will almost always result in a loss of Neopoints.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/ednacackle.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is the three requested item Edna Avatar theory actually true? </b><br>
Not exactly, but we have been told that completing a quest with multiple requested items should be done over a quest with fewer items if we wanted the Edna - Cackle! avatar.</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 603 | Question 4 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=603">link</a>]<p>
<strong> Okay TNT, it's been almost 10 years. 10! And yet, still no one knows how exactly to get the "Edna - Cackle!" avatar. Rumor has it that TNT has said it is not random (I can't seem to find proof of this), so let's hear it. Is the avatar really random? If not, can you please, please, please (See, I'm not above begging!) give us a hint?!? ~lavylovesyoulots</strong></p><p>*CACKLE* Well, since it's been "almost 10 years," we suppose we can give you a hint. If you're trying to be thrifty about it, we suggest not bothering to fulfill her requests unless she asks you for a few items.</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Coincidence quests? Are they worth it?</b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/space/coincidence.phtml">Orbiting around Neopia</a>, there's a century-year-old Lutari scientist named Dr. Landelbrot maintaining all the Random Events of Neopia, and he needs your help with repairing his Random Event machine. He will ask for some common Daily items (some are restockable) and will reward your efforts by letting you test out the machine. You have the chance of getting Neopoints, stat boosts, TCGs, Petpetpets, and more! You do also have the chance of getting your Neopoints stolen, having your stats decreased, or most commonly, getting nothing at all.</p><p>

You can do one Coincidence quest per day. A failed Coincidence quest does count for that one quest per day, just do remember to decline the quest to get a new set of requested items the next day as there is no expiration date on the quests.</p><p>

I would say the Coincidence quests are only worthwhile if you only do the quests that are 10k or less. It is very common to get an event that does nothing and the TCG and Petpetpet events are extremely rare. The stat changes, NP loss/gain, and Lottery ticket events are also rare in a sense.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/new-features-3-15-spaceship-intthecoin-2014.jpg"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are Coincidental Fortune Cookies worth it? </b><br>
I would personally say that Coincidental Fortune Cookie are not worth the effort to open them. They do guarantee you an extra (rarely two) quests per day but given that the chance of getting a positive event is unusually rare, that makes it feel discouraging to throw real-money at these quests.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_fc_re.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What happens if I fail any of the Quests of Neopia above? </b><br>
Aside from the Brain Tree and Coincidence quests, there are no consequences for failing the Quests of Neopia above. If you fail a Brain Tree or Coincidence quest, you won't be able to receive a quest from them until the next day.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I use the Shop Wizard for any of these Quests of Neopia? </b><br>
You are allowed to use the Shop Wizard for all the Quests of Neopia mentioned above (Taelia, Brain Tree, Esophagor, Kitchen, Edna, and Coincidence Quests).</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I heard there was a special prize for doing a Brain Tree, Esophagor, and Edna Quest. Is that true? </b><br>
For completing a quest each from those guys, you will be rewarded with the book, Tales of the Esophagor.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/boo_esophagortales.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about any of these Quests of Neopia? </b><br>
Most of these are not profitable, but if you've got the NP to drop and want to have some fun, then go for it. Edna's Quests is the only quest that doesn't have a high-end/long-term incentive aside from the avatar.</p>

<h3><a name="quests"></a>Faerie Quests Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ What are Faerie Quests?</b><br>
Not to be mistaken with Snow/Jhudora/Illusen Quests, <a href="//www.neopets.com/quests.phtml">Faerie Quests</a> are referred to the Faeries that are in need of your help towards rebuilding the fallen ruins that is Faerieland. In return, you will be award Battledome stats (and access to the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/rainbowfountain.phtml">Rainbow Fountain</a> by the Fountain Faerie) for your service.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/nt_images/636_faerie_quests.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where and how do I get Faerie Quests? </b><br>
Faerie Quests are given out in Random Events, Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies, and the Faerie Quest Event. Random Events are, well, randomly given out, Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies can be purchased from the NC Mall; and the Faerie Quest Event happens around the springtime.</p><p>

<br></p><p><b>▸ Where can I find the items for a Faerie Quest? </b><br>
Usershops, Trading Post, Auctions, Quest Help NeoBoard, etc. You are allowed to use a side account to use the Shop Wizard and buy the item on your main account.</p><p>

<br></p><p><b>▸ Do I need to complete every Faerie Quest I get? </b><br>
There are no consequences for declining a Faerie Quest.</p><p>

<br></p><p><b>▸ Do Fountain Faerie Quests stack? </b><br>
Fountain Faerie Quests do not stack, so if you happen to have a Fountain Faerie Dip saved up, you might want to use that dip before you complete another Fountain Faerie Quest (or the random Grey Faerie Quest).<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/tradingcards/340.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are Kaia/Crafting Faerie Quests worth it? </b><br>
Well, that is up to you if you like any of the items I would say. Trading wise, people do like new items, but you usually won't see these newer Faerie Quest wearables rise significantly nowadays.</p><p> Personally and prior October 8th, 2020, I would say Kaia Quests are not worth it. The items are randomly rewarded and difficult to trade away. If there is an item that you like from her prize pool, I would say it would be easier to find someone willing to trade that item off directly.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_kaiaquest_bag.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How can I avoid getting a Kaia Quest? </b><br>
Kaia Quests can only be given out if you have any Neocash items (including Basic Gift Boxes) in your inventory. If you do not want her quests, then I'd recommend putting all your NC Items in your Closet, SDB, or Gallery.</p><p>

<br></p><p><b>▸ Are Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies worth it? </b><br>
Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies are quite worthwhile if you are training your pets and/or wanting to try your luck at getting a Fountain Faerie Quest. They are not necessary to have for training/or getting a Fountain Faerie Quest, but they are a nice booster for those activities.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_fortcookie_4.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I heard Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies are discounted sometimes. If so, when?</b><br>
Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies do get discounted to 50% off during the Faerie Quest Event. The Faerie Quest Event happens around the springtime.</p><p>

<br></p><p><b>▸ How does the Faerie Quest Refresh Boon work? How do I get it?</b><br>
The Faerie Quest Refresh Boon can be obtained from the Battleground Of The Obelisk and Charity Corner. How it works is that when you receive a Faerie Quest, you are allowed to swap it for a different faerie quest (or possibly get the same faerie with the same requested item) once.</p><p> You are able to use the boon again for every new Faerie Quest you receive in that boon time. In order to make the most use of the boon, most players would open a Faerie Quest Fortune Cookie to get one Faerie Quest per day.</p><p>

<strong>Hey TNT! Could you clarify something for us? Does the Space Faerie only offer quests to premium users? A number of us were discussing this on the neoboards, since Space Faerie quests seem to be even more rare than FFQs, and the few people who said they got a visit from the Space Faerie were all premium users.~~leo_flores</strong></p><p>Good to see our players are as observant as ever. The Space Faerie is pretty pally with the Premium users and prefers to visit them whenever she is in need of an item.</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ Why can't I complete my Faerie Quest? </b><br>
If you are unable to complete your Faerie Quest, you either are facing one of the following issues:<br>
- You do not have the item requested.<br>
- Your Active Pet is currently in the Battledome.</p><p>

<br></p><p><b>▸ Do Faerie Quests expire? </b><br>
These types of Faerie Quests do not expire although you might want to complete them eventually to regain access to the Shop Wizard.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/nt_images/517_shop_wizard.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the best time to open Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies? </b><br>
Midnight NST is the best time to open a Faerie Quest Fortune Cookie as you can have the chance for an extra quest since Faerie Quest Fortune Cookie quests reset at Midnight NST.</p><p>

<br></p><p><b>▸ Why are the old Crafting Faerie Quest ingredients being sold in the NC Mall? </b><br>
It's for collectors and the very few members that saved those old Crafting Faerie Quests. As of 2018, they have started to retire the Crafting Faerie Quest materials once the Faerie Quest Event ended for the year.</p><p>

<br></p><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about Faerie Quests? </b><br>
You kinda want to complete them as fast you can since you cannot receive any other of these Faerie Quests until you complete or forfeit the one you've currently got.</p><p>

There are Faerie Quests that are subjectively not worth doing depending on the item they ask for/type of Faerie it is, in which case, feel free to forfeit their quest:</p><p>

- Air Faerie Quests are a personal choice, since some people do like seeing their stats grow, but the Movement stat hasn't been significant since 2012.<br>

- Some Faeries such as the Battle Faerie, Faerie Queen, Fountain Faerie, and Space Faerie occasionally request items that cost way more than the value of the rewards received in terms of the actual training cost for the same amount of stats / paint brush or morphing potion cost for the same paint job.</p><p>

<p><b>▸ What is Jhudora / Illusen Questing? </b><br>
Jhudora and Illusen are in need of various r10-r99 items and want them immediately, because they are impatient. For completing their quests, you are rewarded with fun goodies such as books, food, and strong Battledome weapons.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/jhudorascloud.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/jhudoraohyeah.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/darkfaerie_wand.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/earth_staff.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/illusendoll.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/illusensglade.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the difference Jhudora and Illusen Questing? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/darkfaerie.phtml">Jhudora's Bluff</a> (formerly Jhudora's Cloud):<br>
- Jhudora lives in Faerieland and will reward you with Dark Faerie themed items for completing her quests.<br>
- Jhudora's quests starts to get more difficult around Level 28+. The items of her first two quests are r10-r25<br>
- Her final reward is Wand of the Dark Faerie.<br>
- She is closed on March 17th (Illusen Day), but she does award an avatar on February 4th (Jhudora Day).</p><p>

<a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/earthfaerie.phtml">Illusen's Glade</a>:<br>
- Illusen lives in Meridell and will reward you with Earth Faerie themed items for completing her quests.<br>
- Illusen's quests starts to get more difficult around Level 35+. The items of her first two quests are r10-r20.<br>
- Her final reward is Illusens Staff.<br>

<br><p><b>▸ Is Jhudora / Illusen Questing difficult? </b><br>
These quests start off easy with requests of cheap lower rarity items. As you progress, the quests get more difficult with higher rarity items (eventually capping at only requesting r99s).<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/473_illusen_jhudora.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What happens if I am unable to deliever the requested item in time? </b><br>
If you are unable to complete the quest, your quest level, and score for the High Score Table will be reset. You will have to wait 12 hours to do another quest.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Isn't there an easy way to get the Jhudora / Illusen Questing trophies? </b><br>
The easiest way to get the Jhudora / Illusen Questing trophy is by attemping on the first day on the month and having all the items that can be requested in your inventory (preferably done on Level 1). You will need to do two quests, so it is advised that you do the first quest before ~9 AM NST as you will have to wait 12 hours to do your next quest.</p><p>

If you were unsuccessful with that method, then the way to go would be to just continue on with the quests regularly every 12 hour interval without any prior set up.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/126_1.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/126_2.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/126_3.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/160_1.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/160_2.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/160_3.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is a safe amount of Neopoints to have before Jhudora / Illusen Questing to Level 50? </b><br>
As of March 23rd, 2021, the safest amount of Neopoints to have for Jhudora Questing would be 20m. The safest amount of Neopoints to have for Illusen Questing would be 15m.</p><p>

This amount does not mean you will be guaranteed to reach/finish Level 50, but this is the hypothetical amount of a typical Jhudora / Illusen Questing run without redeeming high end items such as r99 stamps.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neopedia/191_jhudora_03.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where can I find people to sell/lend an unbuyable item quickly for Jhudora / Illusen Questing? </b><br>
You can find collectors to sell/lend requested unbuyable items over at the following NeoBoard Chats below. You would want to first start off at the Trading / Auctions NeoBoard as that's where it's most popular to request backup.</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there some sort of etiquette when requesting Jhudora / Illusen Quest help at the later levels? </b><br>
Here's a quick list of things to know about getting Jhudora / Illusen Quest help when you're around the r99 range:<br>
- Be kind and remember the human.<br>
- Be ready to accept failure.<br>
- Nobody is entitled to lend an item.<br>
- Nobody is entitled to buy/sell an item at a price that a side might disagree with.<br>
- Not everyone is online at the time you would start questing.<br>
- Avoid spamming multiple threads within the same NeoBoard Chat.<br>
- Do follow ups if you plan to do a backup thread such as item requested, completion/failure, time remaining, etc.<br>
- Try to replace a lent item within a reasonable time frame.<br>
- When creating a NeoBoard Post, make your thread easily identifiable that you are on a timed quest (such as putting Jhudora / Illusen and/or their smilies in the title, or a copied message in post). <br></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything after Quest 50 for Jhudora / Illusen Quests? </b><br>
Nope, there is nothing after Quest 50 for Jhudora / Illusen Quests. All the requested items will be r99 until you reset.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/boo_sinkingneopoint.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about Jhudora / Illusen Quests? </b><br>
If you do fail your Jhudora / Illusen Quests, do remember to check back and receive the failure message, so you can try again after 12 hours. The quest reset timer will not be activated until you do so. You don't want to panic when the yearly Illusen's Glade/Jhudora's Bluff avatars come by and you're still on cooldown for either of them.</p>

<h1>Games FAQs</h1>
<p><b>▸ Is it worth it to play Neopets Games? </b><br>
Depending on what you play them for, yes and no. They're a great way to pad out your user lookup with spiffy trophies, but they're not the best for earning fast NP. Not to say they're unviable, they're a great secondary or tertiary NP source for newer accounts saddled with numerous restrictions. However, aged accounts generally have much more efficient means of earning NP.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neopies/2012/nominees/g43ju3h8.jpg"></p>

<h3><a name="flgames"></a>Flash Games Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ Why can't I see anything? It's all just a grey screen/three dots/blank for me when I try to load any Neopets Flash games.</b><br>
Most modern browsers disable Flash content by default due to its security flaws and growing obsolescence, you will, therefore, have to re-enable Flash yourself.
</p><div class="box"><b><a href="#flash">Jump to instructions on how to enable Flash </a></b><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nqH554C.png"></p></div>


<br><p><b>▸ Is it possible to play Flash Games on my mobile device? </b><br>
You will probably require the use of a third-party browser that specifically supports Flash in order to play Flash games on mobile. The only exception is AAA's Revenge, which is actually made in HTML5 and can, therefore, be run on most default mobile browsers.</p><p>

TNT has been working on converting their Flash content to HTML5 over the past few years, so it is expected that the converted versions of these Flash games will all be easily accessible on mobile.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neomail/0605/mobile.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are the best Flash Games to play for Neopoints? </b><br>
While this is largely subjective, varying depending on your aptitude, luck, and sk<i></i>ill, several fan favourites for quick NP include Fashion Fever and Kass Basher.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why is Kass Basher (and other games) giving out fewer points than usual? </b><br>
Game NP ratios change on the 25th of each month. While there are a small handful of games with a static NP ratio, most games have a fluctuating ratio that <i>typically</i> alternates between an easy score and a demanding score each month. NP ratios change in order to encourage players to try a variety of games for NP instead of sticking to just their favorite few.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are Neopoint Flash game boosters worth it? </b><br>
No. They can be a nice bonus if you happen to have them (Premium Membership, Games Fortune Cookie, Lutari Beads, Charity Corner Perk), but it's not worth investing in these specifically for game NP boosters as the benefit is either too paltry or only occurs randomly and is therefore unreliable. You may wish to try the daily Featured Game for the 2x NP bonus though, it's free after all.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_fortcookie_games.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/mobile/talisman_80.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/premium_lucky_charm.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Mirror Games? </b><br>
Mirror games are, as implied, mirrors for the Flash games you can play on Neopets. These mirrors were conceptualized years ago for use in promotional campaigns so that people could try out a copy of some Neopets games on other sites.</p><p>

Mirror games are usually identical to the base game, and they are perfectly fine for you to play and even submit scores and earn NP in. Mirror games may have a different NP ratio from the base game, so in some cases, the mirror is easier to play for NP if the base game currently has a very demanding NP ratio this month.</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> NOTE: You are not allowed to play both the original and the mirror on the same day. For example, if you already sent scores in the mirror version of Meerca Chase II today, do not play and send scores on the original Meerca Chase II today and vice versa. Doing so is considered cheating and TNT may take action against you for it.</p><p>

Additionally, mirror games <b>do not have a high score table</b>. If you wish to earn a trophy in a game, you must play the original.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about Flash Games? </b><br>
In a couple of the older games, you'll sometimes spot Oliver, aka The Phantom Orange Shirt Guy. He was an old Neopets programmer that created many Flash Games like Ice Cream Machine and Yooyuball. You can find his appearances over at the following page:</p><p>

<h3><a name="gametrophies"></a>Game Trophies Related</h3>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Neopets Game Trophies and how do they work? How do I get them? </b><br>
Game trophies that you earn will appear on your user lookup for all to admire. You get these, of course, by playing Neopets games. This is not restricted only to Flash games, a variety of PHP games such as Cheat!, Snow Wars and Cellblock have trophies to earn too.</p><p>

Flash game trophies are earned by submitting any scores that are high enough to place within the <b>top 17</b> of that game's high score table. Placing 1st to 3rd will grant you a Gold trophy, 4th to 8th a Silver, and 9th to 17th a Bronze.</p><p>

PHP games work a bit differently and tend to have varying conditions that must be met in order to earn a trophy in them. For example, winning a specific number of rounds against the CPU opponent. However, some PHP games still feature a high score table. You should look up guides for any specific game you're interested in to see how trophy distribution works in those games.</p><p>

Most high score tables are <b>reset monthly</b>, so even if the scores during the current month are too high for you to beat, they might be lower next month.</p><p>

Once you earn a trophy in a game, you will own it permanently. You do not have to maintain a high score in order to keep your trophy.</p><p>

Trophies can also be upgraded. For example, if you earned a Bronze trophy in a particular game before, you will be able to upgrade that to a Silver or Gold later on if you send a qualifying score. Trophies <b>do not downgrade</b>, if you have a Gold trophy in a game, you will keep the Gold even if you send in a Silver or Bronze score later on.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/tradingcards/305.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I just placed for a trophy, but I don't see it on my userlookup. Why is that? </b><br>
Trophies are not distributed immediately. At the time of writing, they are awarded daily at approximately 8:50 pm NST. This time slowly gets later as the months go by. The trophy script also runs in ascending order of game ID, so if the game you're waiting for has a really high ID number (maybe 1000+) it might take a few minutes before your trophy is awarded. Don't worry if you don't see your trophy immediately.</p><p>

However, a nasty glitch occurs sometimes that causes the trophy script to not run for that day. There is no recourse for when this happens, but at the very least it is a somewhat rare occasion. Days where the trophy script fails to run are known as "skips" or "skip days".</p><p>

Note that because trophies are not awarded immediately, the high score you submit must be on the high score table <b>at the time of awarding</b>. If you sent a qualifying score earlier in the day, but have been pushed off the top 17 by the time trophies are being awarded for that game, you will not receive a trophy.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/template_images/symol_skip.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is a score review? Am I in trouble?</b><br>
Some scores that you submit might be subjected to a review. You will know when a red message appears upon pressing Send Score that your score will be reviewed first. This is normal and there is no need to be alarmed. Score reviews typically occur when scores are sent too quickly, or when you exceed a certain score threshold for that game. Each game has its own individual threshold whereby any score that exceeds the threshold is automatically sent for review.</p><p>

When your score is sent for review, you will not receive the NP for that score or be entered into the high score table until the score is approved, after which they will send you a NeoMail message to inform you that your score was accepted, and you will receive your NP and high score placement then.</p><p>

Reviews typically take a few days to a week, although there have been occasions where reviews take several weeks. Sometimes your score might even be reviewed that very same day. Typically, very popular games that receive a lot of review scores tend to process reviews faster, but this is not a guarantee.</p><p>

Do know that if your score was rejected for whatever reason, you will <b>not be informed</b>. Your score will simply disappear into the void, never to be heard from again.</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> NOTE: TNT is not fond of people discussing or revealing the score thresholds for individual games, do not discuss this on-site.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/356_confused_gelert.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ The game bugged out and didn't enter in my score, what gives?!? </b><br>
Before submitting a score, you might want to ensure that your internet connection is stable and check to see if Neopets itself is encountering any site issues. A fault on either end and your score may fail to go through. Additionally, you are not able to submit scores from a previous day, so if your game window was open before midnight NST*, trying to send a score after midnight will fail. If midnight passes, make sure you close your game window and open a new one, or simply refresh your current one in order to be able to send scores.</p><p>

If your score fails to go through, there is, unfortunately, no recourse. It cannot be recovered, you will simply have to try and get another score.</p><p>

* Technically it happens at 12:02 am NST and not exactly at midnight.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/game_hiscores.gif"></p>

<h3><a name="gamespotlights"></a>Game Spotlights Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ What is Better Than You? </b><br>
Better Than You is a weekly game competition where you aim to beat a predetermined game score. You will receive an avatar and an item prize, as well as NP and a trophy depending on how quickly you managed to beat the score.</p><p>

First 10 winners: Gold Trophy + 20,000 NP<br>
11th to 50th winner: Silver Trophy + 10,000 NP<br>
51st to 500th winner: Bronze Trophy + 3,000 NP</p><p>

Once 500 people have beaten Better Than You, the competition will be closed until the next round begins.</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> NOTE: This was written before TNT announced Better Than You would be on hiatus due to Adobe Flash's EOL. <br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/trophies/112_1.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/trophies/112_2.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/trophies/112_3.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a specific time when Better Than You resets? </b><br>
New rounds of Better Than You typically come out every week on Wednesday. There is no exact time, TNT has to update BTY manually so it could theoretically be at any time on Wednesday. Rarely, they have even released it a day early or a day late. The most common timeframe for when BTY is released is currently between 11 am ~ 4 pm NST, but this can and has changed before and is not a guarantee.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I matched the Better Than You score exactly, why didn't I get the avatar/trophy?</b><br>
Unlike the Daily Dare event which allows you to simply match the given score, you must <b>beat</b> the score given for BTY. Simply matching the BTY score exactly does not count, you need to score higher.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/betterthanyou.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How is each week's Better Than You score determined?</b><br>
The Better Than You score is usually derived from the current high score table for the chosen game. That means BTY rounds at the start of the month are typically easiest while the high scores at at their lowest, and conversely BTY rounds at the end of the month tend to be more difficult.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a way how to predict which game this week's Better Than You is going to be? </b><br>
There is only one (fairly tedious) way to "predict" the upcoming game, and that is to refresh the image URL of the next round until you notice it has been updated. TNT usually updates the image before putting up the next round, and the image might hold a hint as to what the game might be.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/210_eyrie_turdle.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Mystery Picture Competition? </b><br>
The <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/mysterypic.phtml">Mystery Picture Competition</a> is a weekly game competition in which TNT uploads a cropped/blurred/pixelated image and you will have to guess what exactly the image is. The image TNT chooses could technically be from any anywhere on the site.</p><p>

If you correctly guess what the image is, you will receive the shown item prize, NP, as well as a trophy depending on how quickly you managed to answer.</p><p>

First 10 winners: Gold Trophy<br>
11th to 50th winner: Silver Trophy<br>
51st to 250th winner: Bronze Trophy</p><p>

Only the first 250 winners will receive the item and trophy, although anyone who answers correctly afterwards will still receive NP.</p><p>

The NP prize is a 2,000,000 NP pool that is split evenly amongst all winners. That means if only 10 people guess correctly one week, each winner will receive 200,000 NP.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/trophies/105_1.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/trophies/105_2.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/trophies/105_3.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a specific time when Mystery Picture resets?</b><br>
New rounds of Mystery Pic typically come out every week on Thursday. There is no exact time, TNT has to update MPic manually so it could theoretically be at any time on Thursday. Rarely, they have even released it a day early or a day late. The most common timeframe for when MPic is released is currently between 11 am ~ 4 pm NST, but this can and has changed before and is not a guarantee.</p><p>

The current round will be judged on the same day, typically at most a few hours before the new round is posted.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How should I format my answer for Mystery Picture?</b><br>
Since Mystery Pic is not judged manually, trying to find the best way to format your answer so that their automated judging can accurately parse your answer might seem tricky. The most concrete (but not guaranteed) way is to use the page's actual title, located at the top left of the page's main content in bold.</p><p>

<b>For example</b>, if you think the answer is the <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/beach.phtml">Mystery Island Beach</a> it is best to copy and paste the page title shown here:<br></p><div class="box">As such, submitting "The Beach" should be sufficient and is a pretty safe bet.<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/a1skfMD.png"></p></div>



<br><p><b>▸ Does TNT provide any hints to the Mystery Picture answer?</b><br>
While you should not count on receiving any hints, occasionally the item prize being offered for the current Mystery Pic will be related to the source of the image. This is not a guarantee, and more often than not the prize is a random and completely unrelated item.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/desert/usurper_clue.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How is each Mystery Picture created? Is it just a small portion of a larger image, or is it always the full image?</b><br>
While it is always a heavily pixelated mess, TNT is known to do both: pixelating and compressing entire images <b>or</b> simply cropping out a small portion of a larger image and pixelating only that instead. There is no guarantee that the Mystery Pic is really the whole image and not just a cropped portion.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to share Mystery Picture Competition answers? </b><br>
While you are allowed to discuss the image with other users, you are not allowed to outright share the direct answer with them.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What happened to _____ Spotlight? </b><br>
These Spotlight competitions were removed from the site due to low submission numbers and decline of members playing these games.</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to enter in any Game Spotlights on my side accounts? </b><br>
No, Game Spotlights reward you with NP and NP items and as such you are not allowed to participate on your side accounts.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about Game Spotlights? </b><br>

<p><b>▸ What is Food Club? Is Food Club worth it? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/foodclub.phtml">Food Club</a> (FC) is a betting game which makes you profit in the long run. Older accounts in particular can profit a lot from Food Club, as they can bet (and therefore win) more.

<br><p><b>▸ Everything looks so confusing??? How do you even play?</b><br>
If you can count to ten you have enough maths for food club ;) My advice to all newbies is to follow other people's bets. You can find a listing of FC bettors over at <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Hostia">/~Hostia</a>. And if youre just looking for NP, that's all you ever need to do. If you want recommendations on who to follow, let us know your goals for FC and how risky you want to play, and ask over there! :) Just remember that each day you should follow all ten bets from one individual. Don't try mix-n-matching sets blindly, or only following part of a set.

<br><p><b>▸ So, how much NP do I need to start with? How often do you lose? </b><br>
Assuming that you are making bets which are of moderate risk or less, I personally think a enough NP for a week of bets is plenty, but it's really up to you. You can bet less if you want to (though the more you bet, the more profit you are likely to make overall.</p><p>

FC is luck-based so there will be days (sometimes many days in a row!) when you lose. However, it's definitely worthwhile in the long term. How often you lose depends on how riskily you play. As a guess, even safe bettors can expect to lose ~1/4ish of the time.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/pirates/fc/treasure_island_banner.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How old should my account be to playing Food Club? </b><br>
I'd personally start playing at around 1yr, though older accounts are greatly advantaged. To judge for yourself: expect to make back roughly 1.6-2.2x what you bet, copying someone else's bets takes less than 5mins, your bet amount is displayed on the main betting page (it's 50np + 2x your account age in days), and you can make 10 bets per day.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ When are the Food Club gates closed? </b><br>
Gates are closed for betting between 1:45pm and 2:15pm NST. When they reopen, you can still place bets for that round until the results are out.</p><p>

As of March 23rd, 2021, each round ends at about 3:49pm NST and it gets later by a few seconds each day.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/plu_techo_eogletree.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/book_locked.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/plu_elephante_pgpercival.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I accidently placed the wrong bet. Can I take it back? </b><br>
You cannot take back your Food Club bets. Placing bets that were from the prior round to the next round will never win, so don't bet really late when results are rolling out.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where can I find my Food Club bets/results? </b><br>
You can find your current Food Club bets in this <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/foodclub.phtml?type=current_bets">link</a> and you can find the results in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/foodclub.phtml?type=collect">Collecting Winnings link</a>. If the round has ended by seeing that the <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/foodclub.phtml?type=current_bets">Current Bets page</a> is empty and you do not see any winnings, that means you busted. Also, do know that Food Club bets do expire after 8 days.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is Charity Corner's "Oh, Blimey!" (+5 Bets For 1 Week) Food Club Perk any good? </b><br>
If we considered the NP to point cost from last year's Charity Corner, the cost of points used would exceed the amount of NP gained in return on average (assuming we went with the more painless method of donating Sticky Snowball<i></i>s instead of a thousand 1 point items). An older account that can bet ~10.6k+ would only slightly benefit from the perk as much in comparison of betting without it.</p><p>

Trophy-wise, this perk can be handy to cover more scenarios if you are disregarding the profit difference without it.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/template_images/negg_fish_floating.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Do the Food Club odds change? If so, why?</b><br>
The probability of a pirate winning does not change as the round progresses. However, the return you'd get from a given pirate does change depending on how many people bet on that pirate (or others in an arena). Odds going up means you'd win more if they do win, odds going down means you'd win less.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I saw there was a trophy for Food Club. How would one get that? </b><br>
Trophies are awarded each day for largest NP collection. You can hold your winnings for 7 days and 8 rounds. Many people try for a trophy run at the end of the month since scores are reset on the 1st (so hold from the 25th - 1st if there are 31 days in the month, from the 24th - 1st if there are 30 days).</p><p>

For a trophy run, it's recommended that you make more risky bets with higher chance of returns. Also, since trophy runs depend on how much you win from Food Club, older accounts who can bet more per bet, have the advantage.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/trophies/88_1.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/trophies/88_2.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/trophies/88_3.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Food Adjustments/Allergies? </b><br>
Each pirate has food types that they like and ones they are allergic too, and this can influence their performance. Some people use this to inform their bets, but in general food adjustment is already factored into opening odds.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What does this acronym/phrase mean in Food Club? </b><br>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about Food Club? </b><br>
Food Club is game of luck! There will be times where you will encounter some bad days in Food Club, but this game is still a pretty decent way of how to earn tons of Neopoints over time.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/pirates/fc/fc_pirate_20.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/pirates/fc/fc_pirate_15.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/pirates/fc/fc_pirate_9.gif"></p>

<h3><a name="neoquest"></a>NeoQuest I &amp; II Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ Is NeoQuest going to break once Flash has been removed? </b><br>
Neither of the NeoQuest games are Flash-based, so they will be unaffected.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/caption/sm_caption_739.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is NeoQuest I linked to NeoQuest II? </b><br>
They both have similar gameplay, but are otherwise not linked and have completely unrelated stories. You do not have to finish NeoQuest I to start NeoQuest II.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ My NeoQuest progress is gone?!? </b><br>
NeoQuest I is linked to your active pet. If you have changed your active pet since you last played, you will have to change back. Additionally, NeoQuest I games reset after approximately several months to a year of inactivity. NeoQuest II games are linked to your account instead of a particular pet, and also will never reset.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ If NeoQuest I is linked to a particular pet, what happens if I abandon or trade the pet away? </b><br>
Your game will be transferred with the pet. Whoever adopts or receives your pet will be able to continue an active NQ game from where you left off with that pet.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/elephante_halloween_happy.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What happens if I die in NeoQuest? </b><br>
You will lose some EXP, and in NeoQuest II, your current Gold will be halved upon dying.<br>

You will also be transported back to Neopia City (NQ I) or your most recent resting point (NQ II).<br>

If you die while playing on Insane mode, you will have to start over from the beginning instead. This applies to both NQ I and II.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I access the higher difficulties for NeoQuest? </b><br>
You can access Evil difficulty by beating Normal, and you can access Insane by beating Evil. This applies to both NeoQuest I and II. Since game progress is tied to your pet for NeoQuest I, receiving someone else's pet that has already cleared Normal or Evil mode will also allow you to skip those and challenge the next difficulty immediately.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What do the different difficulties encompass? </b><br>
In general, all enemies and bosses have higher health and may gain additional sk<i></i>ills they did not have on lower difficulties.</p><p>

On NeoQuest I's Evil mode, there will be another final boss immediately after the original one.<br>
On NeoQuest I's Insane mode, the EXP required for each level-up is doubled, and there is a third final boss immediately after the initial two.</p><p>

On NeoQuest II's Evil and Insane mode, regular enemies will start dropping equipment with sk<i></i>ill bonuses.</p><p>

Dying on Insane mode in either game will force you to restart the game from the beginning.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/caption/sm_caption_376.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are there any good guides for NeoQuest? </b><br>
A guide directory featuring a plethora of NQ I and II guides can be found in the link below. Dedicated sk<i></i>ill guides and maps can be found there as well.<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Tetrakaidecagon">/~Tetrakaidecagon</a></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What do I get for finishing NeoQuest? </b><br>
Finishing NeoQuest I and II will award you their Bronze/Silver/Gold trophy for beating Normal/Evil/Insane mode respectively.</p><p>

Both games have avatars that can be earned (1 avatar in NQ I and 3 in NQ II) by completing various in-game tasks.</p><p>

NeoQuest II awards you a random exclusive item for beating the game. Insane mode will only award items once, but lower difficulties will award prizes each time you complete them. Check a dedicated NQ II guide for a breakdown of which item can be obtained from which mode. You will also receive Neopoints for beating bosses.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/91_1.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/91_2.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/91_3.gif"><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/372_1.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/372_2.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/372_3.gif"><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/weakling.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/bunninator.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/devilpuss.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/nq1erick.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I play NeoQuest on my side accounts? </b><br>
No. Since you will receive items/Neopoints for playing NeoQuest I and II, you may only play them on your main account.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about NeoQuest? </b><br>
In Neoquest II, if you've saved your Fathers Sword, then it might be of great use against the final fight against Terask. Your Fathers Sword does 25% more damage than Sword of Kings in the final battle.</p>

<h3><a name="kads"></a>The Kadoatery Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ The Kadoatery? What's it for? </b><br>
The Kadoatery is a game where you aim to feed hungry Kadoaties before others! You'll get a trophy when you feed your first one.</p><p>

As you feed more, your trophy will upgrade from Bronze (1 to 9 fed) to Silver (10 to 24 fed) and finally Gold (25+ fed). Once you've fed 75, you'll also obtain the Kadoatery avatar.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/kadoatery/trophy1.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/kadoatery/trophy2.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/kadoatery/trophy3.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/kadoatery.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I feed a Kadoatie? </b><br>
If there's a Kad that's unfed, the food item it currently desires will be listed below it. Simply obtain the food item and click on the Kad to feed it, but you have to be quick or someone might feed it before you.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I hear Kadoaties are notoriously hard to feed due to the competition. Is this true? </b><br>
While it might have been true in the past, these days it's really not so bad. The player base has unfortunately dwindled since the site's heyday, but that means less competition in the Kadoatery too. Your timezone may come into play as well, some timezones are more active than others.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Should I hoard lots of food items that Kadoaties might want before trying to feed any? </b><br>
Buying food beforehand (referred to as having an SDB) is not recommended if you are only playing for the avatar. It is very costly to complete a full SDB of Kad food, this is mostly done only by dedicated feeders who intend to feed past 75. If you're only here for the avatar, you should just search for and buy the item you need on the Shop Wizard quickly.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/toy_musicbox_kadoatie.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is the Super Shop Wizard better for Kadding? </b><br>
While it's better on your wallet, some players note that SSW takes a bit more time to find an item than the regular SW, probably because SSW tries to search the entire market at once. In the end, it's up to you, it doesn't really make that much of a difference in the short term.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I went to the Kadoatery and the food they're asking for is all so expensive! </b><br>
Don't get the wrong impression! The unfed Kads you'll usually see upon casually walking in are indeed usually the really expensive ones. That's why they've been unfed for a while. All the other fed Kads are probably reasonably cheap, which is why they've all been fed already. If you want to go for a cheap Kad, you should try to catch them when they've just refreshed and are hungry again.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are those expensive Kads going to be there forever? </b><br>
As long as nobody feeds them, yes they will remain there and occupy space. Eventually, someone will come along and feed them though, but it might take a while before anyone volunteers.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_cybunny_neggblue.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/negg_anniversary.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_biscuits_kadoatie.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_toffapp_chokato.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_toffapp_tchea.gif"><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_purple_stuff.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_custard_tiger.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_illusen_cake_family_recipe.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bak_tuskicecream_flaming.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_icecream_spill.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why are all the Kads crying when they've already been fed? </b><br>
It's just a little detail thrown in by TNT, at 11 pm NST the Kadoatery's lights are turned off and the Kadoaties start to cry since they're afraid of the dark. The lights come back on at 3 am NST, so they'll stop crying then.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ When do the Kads refresh? </b><br>
To find out, you'll want to visit the Kadoatery topic on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=23">Games NeoBoard</a>. Look for a topic featuring Kadoatie emoticons, that should usually be the one you need. Inside you'll find fellow Kadoatie feeders, new and seasoned, who are tracking the next possible refresh times for the Kadoatery. The people who track refresh times are known as timekeepers or TKers.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I don't understand the timekeeping posts. How does a refresh actually work? </b><br>
For that, you should refer to a dedicated Kadding guide to help you understand the nuances of the Kadoatery's mechanics (one will be linked below). You'll also learn about the various terms used on the Kadoatie boards such as splits, mains, minis, NTO, etc.<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Shouir">/~Shouir</a><br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_ppph_goldhourglass.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is it ok to help out with timekeeping? </b><br>
There's a great guide mentioned below if you'd like to help out with the tking effort. It's recommended to observe the more experienced TKers first, in addition to reading the tking guide thoroughly. Timekeeping is very important and many people depend on accurate tking to feed Kads, so learn the subject well! <br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"><a href="//www.neopets.com/~ohmyaelin">/~ohmyaelin</a></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there any point to feeding more than 75 Kadoaties? </b><br>
The number of Kadoaties you fed is displayed on your trophy and will continue to increase. There is no other tangible reward, however, but it can be a lot of fun to feed Kadoaties.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why do people overfeed? </b><br>
Many of the overfeeders have been feeding Kadoaties for years, for a variety of reasons. Some enjoy improving their trophy's feed count, some enjoy the rush of trying to feed Kadoaties quickly, some find it relaxing, some enjoy the Kadding community, etc. It is a hobby for many.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1597.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about The Kadoatery? </b><br>
Some of the Kadoatie names have pop culture references to them. There are names from Mario Bros., Futurama, Naruto, and more!</p>

<h3><a name="stocks"></a>Stock Market Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ What is the Stock Market? </b><br>
The Neopets Stock Market is a HTML game that you can find <a href="//www.neopets.com/stockmarket.phtml">here</a>. The aim is to turn a profit by buying and selling company shares, which are portions of a company's money that you can own, and which change in value over time. However, unlike the real-world stock market, the value of company shares in the Neopets Stock Market are decided by algorithms and not by changes in the economy. There are many other differences as well, but the Neopets Stock market is altogether much less risky and complicated to invest in.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/pages/icons/med/m-780.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What stocks should I buy, and when? </b><br>
Firstly, the lowest price that you can normally buy shares for is 15np. You should always buy from companies with shares at this price if possible, but if you only have a short window to buy, share prices of up to 17np will do. Secondly, you can only buy 1,000 shares per day. To make the most profit in the long run you should buy the full amount available daily, if you can. Following this method, you will be spending between 15,000np and 17,000np per day on shares. Make sure to complete the Trudy's Surprise daily every day, as for most of the month this will give you enough np to invest!</p><p>

To make it easier to find the cheapest stocks, there is a hidden "bargain" page sorting the companies with the lowest current share prices that can be found <a href="//www.neopets.com/stockmarket.phtml?type=list&amp;search=+-invalid_characters-+&amp;bargain=true">here</a>. It is also worth noting that some Battleground of the Obelisk and Charity Corner event boons allow you to buy stocks for prices as low as 10np per share, allowing you to profit even more in the long run
.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I buy stocks? </b><br>
You can find information about companies by clicking the Buy tab and searching for a ticker symbol (a set of letters representing a company), through the <a href="//www.neopets.com/stockmarket.phtml?type=list&amp;full=true">full list</a> of companies, or through the hidden <a href="//www.neopets.com/stockmarket.phtml?type=list&amp;search=+-invalid_characters-+&amp;bargain=true">bargain" page</a>. Each of these pages shows you the number of stocks available for that company (Volume), the price that company's shares started out at that day (Open), the current price of the shares (Curr), and the numerical change from the beginning of the day price to the current price (Change). The Curr column is the only column necessary when deciding which stocks to buy. The prices for all companies update approximately every 30 minutes, but it is worth noting that they can stay the same.</p><p>

Once you have chosen a company to invest in, click on the letters of its ticker symbol. This will take you to the company profile, which will tell you some information about the company (note that this is only useful as trivia and doesn't have any impact on stocks). Then, click the company's full name to get to the Buying Shares page for that company. Type the number of shares you want to buy in the Number of Shares box (up to a maximum of 1,000 per day) and click Buy Shares to complete the purchase.</p><p>

Your purchased shares will then show up in your portfolio (on the My Portfolio tab). This page shows you the same Open, Current and Change information that was seen on the buying pages, now under the heading "Today". The other columns, with the headings Holdings and Overall, show you the quantity of shares you own in each company (Qty), the total amount you paid for the shares (Paid), the total amount all the shares would currently sell for (Mkt Value) and the percentage change between the amount you spent in total and the total amount the shares would currently sell for (% Change). The Current Price column is again the only column necessary for deciding which stocks to sell.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/80_neorvette.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ When should I sell stocks? </b><br>
That is entirely up to you! The only rule to follow in order not to lose np is to never sell your shares for less than you bought them. Many people decide on a share price to sell at (usually between 60np -100np) and will not sell until one of their stocks hit that price. However, there are multiple selling strategies giving faster turnovers or larger profits that are described by SilverCyanide <a href="//www.neopets.com/~SilverCyanide2#The%2015%20/%2030%20Method">here</a>.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I sell stocks? </b><br>
When it becomes time to sell your stocks, visit your Portfolio page. Next to the icon for each company, there is a small grey triangle that, when clicked, will drop down with all the sets of shares you own for the company. In the "Sell" box, on the far right, type in the number of shares you want to sell in each row. Then, click Sell Shares at the bottom of the page or hit Enter on your keyboard to open a new window which will tell you how much you sold each share for. Nigel the Chia takes a tiny 20np commission from your on-hand np for every sale you make, and you can't sell without it, so remember to have a few np available.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/stock_graph.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is investing in the Stock Market worth it? </b><br>
The short answer is yes, as there is a lot to gain and little to lose. However, as time is required to turn a profit, patience is a necessity. Shares can take weeks, months or years to gain in value, so whilst you can usually expect a sure profit, it will probably not be a fast turnaround.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Do stocks go bankrupt anymore? </b><br>
The last recorded bankruptcy was in 2004. With everything that has happened regarding the management and development of Neopets since then, it is difficult to say whether more stock companies will go bankrupt, but it is highly unlikely. Although no bankrupt companies have ever started selling shares again, the chances of losing out on your investments in the Neopets Stock Market currently are so small that they are not worth worrying about, especially if you diversify.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How long does it take for Stocks to be ideally profitable to sell? </b><br>
No matter what strategy you choose to tackle the Neopets Stock Market, it will usually take at least a few weeks to begin to profit, possibly longer. Most established strategies recommend starting by spending 3 - 4 weeks building up your portfolio by investing in shares from a lot of different companies. Past that, it is mostly a waiting game that could take months or years to reach consistent profit, but profit is almost certainly going to be inevitable. Of course, you do have to remember to sell your stocks when the time is right, otherwise you won't earn anything! It is a good idea to make sure to regularly check your current share prices, which at a minimum you should do every time you invest daily.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_games/n618_de.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can Neopets Premium help me with the Stock Market? </b><br>
The Premium toolbar on Neopets offers a Stock Market overview on the Bankroll tab which can show you the overall quantity of stocks you own, the total amount you have invested, the overall current market value of all your stocks, and the % change in the amount invested and the current market value. This does not notify you of individual stock changes and does become less useful the more diverse your portfolio. However, it can be useful to track your progress towards the avatar and to see whether your stock values are positive or negative overall.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What do I do if I just want the avatar? </b><br>
If you invest in 1,000 stocks at 15np each per day, then you will get the "Sell! SELL!!" avatar in 67 days and will have set yourself up a diverse portfolio in the process. However, if you don't want to wait that long, there is a much faster way to get it. Due to a glitch, you cannot get the avatar by buying shares worth over 1,000np, and as you can only buy 1,000 shares per day, this means that you will need to buy shares on at least 2 different days in order to get the avatar. You can therefore invest just before and just after 12am NST in shares worth between 500np – 999np and then sell them straight away to get the avatar without risking much of your np. For more detailed information on this fast method, read DT's guide <a href="//www.neopets.com/~MultiSlacker">here</a>.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/neodaqtick.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Should I only buy stocks in one company, or should I diversify? </b><br>
It is best to spread your money out by buying shares in many different companies. There are many reasons for this. Firstly, if you only buy from one company, you will probably not always be able to take advantage of buying at the lowest share price of 15np and your profit will be limited. Secondly, it lowers your risk; if you invest in 5,000 shares of one company and the company goes bankrupt, you lose all your investment. However, if you invest in 1,000 shares of five companies and one goes bankrupt, you still have 4,000 shares left. Finally, if you diversify, there is a greater chance that the next stock to reach a profitable share price will be one of yours, and you can sell.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I play the Stock Market on a side account? </b><br>
No – this is against the rules, as the stock market will earn you NP!</p>

<h3><a name="tycoon"></a>Plushie Tycoon Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ What is Plushie Tycoon? </b><br>
Plushie Tycoon is essentially a "business simulation" game. You will start off in the game with 50,000 NP and in order to "win" you must turn out a profit by the end of the game (50,001 NPs or above).<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_games/n170.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What do I get for winning? </b><br>
Any win will net you the Plushie Tycoon avatar and at least a Bronze trophy, but you may receive a better trophy depending on how much NP you managed to obtain.</p><p>

50,001+ NP = Bronze trophy<br>
250,001+ NP = Silver trophy<br>
1,000,000+ NP = Gold trophy</p><p>

You will also receive an NP prize depending on how many plushies you managed to sell, the minimum being 1k and maximum being 320k.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/170_1.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/170_2.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/170_3.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is it worth playing Plushie Tycoon for NP? </b><br>
No, there are much better alternatives to making NP these days. Receiving several hundred thousand for one game of Plushie Tycoon may sound enticing, but the time and effort needed (requires over 2,000,000 plushies sold for the max prize of 320k NP) far outweighs the potential gain. Play for the avatar or trophy, or for fun, but this is not an efficient way to earn NP.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is it best to start as early as possible in the month? </b><br>
Not necessarily. Keep in mind that taxes and rent are due every 7 days after your first-day*, so starting too early might cause your taxes and rent to be due extremely close to the end of the month, which is not ideal. Depending on how many days there are in the current month, you should ideally start on a day that leaves you with only 3 tax/rent days instead of 4.</p><p>

* e.g. starting on the 4th means your tax and rent are payable on the 11th, 18th and 25th.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/tycoon/schedule.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I'm trying to make/sell plushies in the factory/store but nothing is happening? </b><br>
The game doesn't run 24/7, it only runs for 8 hours a day. By default, it runs from 10 am NST to 6 pm NST every day, but you can customize the timezone from the main PT page at the beginning of the game so that the 8 hours are at a more convenient time for you.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are there any good resources for Plushie Tycoon? </b><br>
A fairly comprehensive basic start-up guide can be found here:<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"><a href="//www.neopets.com/~MapleHood">/~MapleHood</a></p><p>

This page is an excellent resource for all kinds of PT information, such as basic loading times, upgrading costs, etc.<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"><a href="//www.neopets.com/~GrundyTycoon">/~GrundyTycoon</a>
</p>

<br><p><b>▸ When is the factory/sales update? </b><br>
There is an update every hour while your game is running (8 updates a day). Many PT guides still list the update time at :01, but this is no longer accurate due to a glitch that causes it to get later by approximately 1 minute every day. Since it is constantly getting later, an exact answer cannot be provided here, but once you find the current update time you should be able to easily keep your eye on it going forward.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/tycoon/factory.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why did I suddenly go bankrupt? </b><br>
If you find yourself suddenly losing large amounts of money, ensure that you have fired the workers in your factory. Your workers will continue to take hourly payment even if your factory no longer has any pending jobs. Forgetting to fire factory workers is a common mistake and is the most prominent cause of bankruptcy for newer players.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What happens if I go bankrupt? </b><br>
You will, unfortunately, have to restart your game. Note that you can restart as many times within the month as necessary, so there is no actual penalty for going bankrupt aside from the time lost from having to start over.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/tycoon/rent_4.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are the best species of plushies to buy? </b><br>
There are no single best species of plushie to buy, but in general, you should probably <b>avoid</b> any plushies that:</p><p>

- Require less than 3 or 4 rolls of cloth.<br>
- Do not require accessories.</p><p>

Beyond this, feel free to experiment with different species and materials. Since sales prices fluctuate constantly, none of them will be the best all the time.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Should I do a full game if I want the avatar? </b><br>
If you're only aiming for the avatar, it is possible to pull through in only 1 week. Start 6 days before the last day of the month (e.g 24th if the month has 30 days) and follow the <a href="//www.neopets.com/~MapleHood">/~MapleHood Guide</a> linked above. Doing so means the game will end before you have to deal with any taxes or rent.</p><p>

On average, you should be able to make a profit after 4 days, but this is dependent on your luck with raw material prices/sales prices.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/plushieTycoon.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I need more help, is there anywhere I can go to ask about Plushie Tycoon? </b><br>
The Games section of the NeoBoards always has a Plushie Tycoon help topic that is run by experienced PT players who can offer more specific advice for your game.<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"><a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=23">Games NeoBoard Chat</a>

<h1>Mobile FAQs</h1>

<h3><a name="mobileapp"></a>Mobile App Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ Is Neopets moving to mobile soon?</b><br>
Neopets is not creating a mobile app. It was stated by a TNT Staff member that it was the very first thing they looked at, but it was deemed unfeasible at the time (Sep 2020).<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_space_calculationdevice.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is the site only going to be on mobile in the future? Meaning the site will not exist on desktop?</b><br>
The site will still exist on desktop. It is not going away to solely function on mobile.</p><p>

- Neopets Editorial - Issue 862 | Question 9 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=862">link</a>] (Confirmation that the site will still exist on desktop)</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Weren't there plans for a mobile app at the end of Viacom's ownership? </b><br>
Yes, there were plans for a Neopets mobile companion app, and it was called Neopets On-The-Go. From retired TNT Staff Member, Snarkie:

The implementation of a mobile-friendly site would have taken monumentally long and the idea was not guaranteed approval, so a companion app was discussed instead! The companion app would have been more of a supportive tool when players would be away from the desktop site, featuring activtites such as checking your NeoMails, training times, and more.</p><p>

As apps of this nature are often not financially viable, the idea was not fully pursued. The app still saw development by a small team of volunteers (salaried workers that would work overtime without pay) and was essentially a side passion project. </p><p>

At 97% completion, the mobile app was unfortunately cancelled by JumpStart. All the remaining resources were directed to the creation of Ghoul Catchers, and they never knew why. By the time this information was posted, the companion app's coding would have been too outdated by today's standards to ever be released.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/rpp_reu2014_robotassispetpet.gif"></p>

<h3><a name="mobilebeta"></a>Mobile Beta Related</h3>

<p><b>▸ What is Mobile Beta?</b><br>
If you haven't heard, support for Adobe Flash is ending on December 31, 2020, so Neopets Beta (or Neopets mobile-friendly beta) is a new Flash-free interface. You can read more at the following:</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anyway can I go back into the Neopets Classic? </b><br>
You can add an "/" or "/x" to the end of the URL string to return back to Neopets Classic, but this (and any other workarounds) will probably be patched in the future. For the Flash Customization page and old Gamesroom page, they now have their own Classic links:</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where's the link to __? </b><br>
Neopets Beta does not include most toolbar links, so you'll have to use the bookmark feature for now to save those links. Most common quick links can be found in the following pages:</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I change my Site Theme for Neoepts Beta? </b><br>
Head over to your <a href="//www.neopets.com/preferences.phtml">Settings/Preferences</a> and there should be a Beta Theme section. Do note that not all of the site themes have been converted, but at least you can change out of the default theme.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I can't find my NC items in the Inventory of Neopets Beta. Help! </b><br>
In the top right corner of your inventory, there should be a toggle feature to swap NP items and NC items.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JQt3Ldx.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ My unconverted (UC) pets look odd in the Beta Customization application. What's up with that? </b><br>
Not all the unconverted pets' artwork have been fully transferred, this issue has been noted by TNT support.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ My unconverted (UC) pets aren't saving properly in the Beta Customization application. Why is that? </b><br>
UC Customization is currently broken on Neopets Beta. You can still save UC customizations through the Classic Customization application though. </p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why are some of my closet items missing/blanked out? </b><br>
This could mean several things:<br>
- The items have not been converted to Beta yet.<br>
- The items are currently being worn on another pet.<br>
- The items are saved in the presets feature.<br>
- The items are not in your <a href="//www.neopets.com/closet.phtml">Closet</a>, and are actually located in your <a href="//www.neopets.com/safetydeposit.phtml">Safety Deposit Box</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/gallery/index.phtml">Gallery</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/ncma">NC Album</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/inventory.phtml/">Inventory</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/items/transfer_list.phtml">Item Transfer Log</a>, etc.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/25_chia_cowboy.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is it possible to attach Petpetpets (P3s) to my Petpets (P2s) in Neopets Beta? </b><br>
No, it is not possible to attach Petpetpets to your Petpets in Neopets Beta. You must use the <a href="//www.neopets.com/inventory.phtml/x">Classic Inventory</a> to attach Petpetpets to your Petpets.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are Random Events active in Neopets Beta? </b><br>
Random Events are not active in Neopets Beta. Random Event avatars with interactive requirements are still active, however (i.e. the Sloth! avatar is not available). If you plan on getting certain avatars, Battledome challengers, etc. then we'd suggest visiting its Classic page (add an "/" or "/x" to the end of the URL string) if available.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why are there only 7 games in Neopets Beta? </b><br>
Most, but not all, of the Flash games are in the process of being converted into HTML5. The most popular games and avatar games are guaranteed to be converted for the new Games Room eventually.</p><p>

In addition to this, the following features are currently not available, but will be implemented in the future:<br>
- NC Featured Game Tickets (and presumably Send It Again Game Tickets)<br>
- In-game Cheat Codes<br>
- Clickable The Phantom Orange Shirt Guy appearances<br>
- Item rewards (none of those games have been converted yet)<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/nt_images/566_kassbasherplushie.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why aren't game score submissions working in Neopets Beta? </b><br>
For most of the converted games, score submission was disabled. For the other games that otherwise allow score submissions but are still experiencing this issue, the reason is possibly one or more of the following:</p><p>
- Score submissions were submitted too quickly.<br>
- The score was absurdly high (commonly noticed in Igloo Garage Sale, but the Review Score for that is 1,998 pts).<br>
- The day has been reset (Midnight NST, after 12:03:00 AM to be exact).</p><p>

For Fashion Fever, you will need to wait 10 seconds in order for the score submission to work.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to send scores for both converted games and Flash games on the same day? </b><br>
Similar to mirror games, no. You are only allowed to submit scores on one or the other within a day.</p><p>

- Neopets Editorial - Issue 924 | Question 1 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=924">link</a>] (You are <b>NOT</b> allowed to send scores for both converted games and converted/mirror games)</p>

<br><p><b>▸ A Neopets Beta game just rewarded me more than the usual 1k Limit of NP per game. Am I in trouble? </b><br>
No, but you should probably send a ticket stating that you experienced this problem.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/125_mug_snow.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are Neopets Beta games awarding Game Avatars? </b><br>
Aside from Ice Cream Machine, they are not awarding Game Avatars at the moment, but if the Flash version is still functional on your end, then it is still possible to use that version to earn the Game Avatar in question.</p><p>

This is a known and common issue. You will just have to refresh the page until the wheel appears.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is this NeoHomes 3.0 I'm hearing about? </b><br>
Due to Classic NeoHomes (1.0) and NeoHomes 2.0 being Flash features, they are being replaced with a new creation. It is recommended that you empty your Shed in the meantime before its launch.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/321_neohome.gif"></p>

<h3><a name="ghoulcatchers"></a>Ghoul Catchers Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ Is downloading Ghoul Catchers worth it? </b><br>
You will earn 1k NP for finishing level 1 which takes about 10 seconds or less, and you can do this 50 times a day.</p><p>

The 50k NP per day that it provides for minimal effort is a huge income boost for a majority of players, making Ghoul Catchers totally worth it. The collectables you get as prizes for clearing each land can sell for quite a bit too, although this is optional (and quite difficult) and simply sticking to 50k a day will earn you much more in the long run anyway.</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> As of July 22, 2020, TNT announced that Ghoul Catchers will be discontinued, and the app was removed from app stores. If you have downloaded the game before its retirement, you can still earn rewards from playing the game until December 31, 2020 (?).<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/tradingcards/premium/1510.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What's my Ghoul Catchers login? </b><br>
Ghoul Catchers uses your Neopets UN and PW. Some people report issues logging in when their password is too long, so try changing passwords if you are experiencing login problems.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ When does Ghoul Catchers' 50k-a-Day reset? </b><br>
Ghoul Catchers resets at midnight GMT every day, which is 4 pm NST (5 pm NST during Daylight Savings Time).<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/caption/sm_caption_868.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How long does it take to receive my signup prizes? </b><br>
The signup prizes should be awarded to you immediately, but this is known to be glitchy and unfortunately can take much longer or not even be awarded at all. This also applies to any item rewards for clearing later levels.

</p><br><p><b>▸ Why does it keep saying I reached my Neopoints limit before 50k? </b><br>
This is a bug, the message is not accurate. Keep playing and you will notice that NP is still being awarded to you until you have actually played 50 times for the day. The best way to tell when you have actually reached the limit is to note how much NP you had on hand before playing and to stop once you have 50k more.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/mobile/ghoulcatchers/Ghoul-Catchers-puzzle-games-ghosts.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are all the ads/videos broken? </b><br>
Kinda, they are mostly broken. Watching ads would award you with powerups that would be useful in clearing difficult levels, but these ads no are pretty sporadic when they want to load.

</p><br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about Ghoul Catchers? </b><br>
The game is essentially dead (no pun intended) to TNT. As of March 23rd, 2021, the NP rewards are still being given out, but the Amulets and Backgrounds either have major reward delays or not currently being rewarded.

<p><b>▸ Is downloading Legends &amp; Letters worth it? </b><br>
The prizes that can be earned from Legends &amp; Letters are all No-Trade (with the exception of Pirate Paint Brush), so it is largely dependent on whether you personally want any of these items, as you can only obtain them by playing the game yourself. You can also win trophies and an avatar.</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> As of July 22, 2020, TNT announced that Legends &amp; Letters will be discontinued, and the app was removed from app stores.

<br><p><b>▸ How do I earn prizes from Legends &amp; Letters? </b><br>
Prizes are not available all the time in Legends &amp; Letters. Rather, a "Crossover Week" is held every 4 weeks, during which completing the daily Challenge of Challenges content will award you chests that can be opened for a random exclusive item. You will also receive the avatar for participating, as well as the trophies depending on how many challenges you completed.</p><p>

There are no on-site prizes for playing Legends &amp; Letters when it is not Crossover Week.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I'm locked out! Help! </b><br>
The Legends &amp; Letters servers are plagued by bouts of instability and high latency. If you are unable to log in, it could be the fault of the servers. Check in with other players to see if they are experiencing the same issue. If so, it will eventually pass. If you are unable to log in even when the servers are fine, consider reinstalling the app or sending in a ticket to the <a href="//www.neopets.com/help.phtml">official FAQ</a> and remember to provide both your Legends &amp; Letters UN and Neopets UN to the support staff.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I don't see Legends &amp; Letters available for me to download. Do you have any idea?</b><br>
Before the game's discontinuation, the game was not available for download in Belgium and the Netherlands due to some country specific anti-loot box laws.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/324_niptor.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Did TNT ever release the 10th Crossover Week trophies?</b><br>
TNT have not released the trophies nor acknowledged this issue. They have stated that after the game's discontinuation, bug fixes and technical support will no longer be provided for the game.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about Legends &amp; Letters?</b><br>
The game is essentially dead and there are no active on-site rewards for the game. If you just want to play the game for fun, then there's no one stopping you from doing so.</p>

<p><b>▸ What is Neopets: Island Builders?</b><br>
Neopets: Island Builders is Neopets's fourth mobile app game. It is a 3D Construction Simulation game and your job is to rebuild the destroyed island civilization of Dacardia. The game is currently in open beta for Android and closed beta for iOS. For information on how to download and play the game, I would read over Jellyneo's on-going article:</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> Jellyneo's Neopets: Island Builders Guide<br>
jellyneo.net/?go=island_builders<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tNov85K.png?1="></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is downloading Neopets: Island Builders worth it?</b><br>
As of it's launch, you cannot earn NP nor obtain any tradable items on-site, so not really unless you want the three No-Trade items. That information can be found in this Jellyneo Article:</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> Jellyneo's Neopets: Island Account Linking Article<br>
jellyneo.net/?go=island_builders&amp;id=account_linking</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Do I expand my island towards the giant jungle waterfall first or the purple space mountain?</b><br>
It is recommended that you expand your island towards the Mystic Jungle first over the Crystal Plateau. This is because the Mystic Jungle Route has the following:</p><p>
- An increased amount of Core Buildings for faster Town Leveling.<br>
- Quests and Gathering items are more quickly obtainable.<br>
- An increased pet amount.<br>
- The Crystal Plateau items are generally more difficult to come by.<br>
- Jungle Route has Active Quest sequence that also unlocks an amenity building sooner.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/339_yurble_jog.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are pet elements and ideals randomized? Is there any way I can get a specific pet element/ideal combination?</b><br>
Yes, pet elements and ideals randomized, and no, there is currently no way how to get a specific pet element/ideal combination.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What's the most efficient way to gather Power Neggs?</b><br>
Here is a quick list of ways you can efficiently gather Power Neggs:</p><p>

- Turn in items that can gathered quickly en masse such as Rocks, Pirate Daggers, Magnets, and Echo to the Power Plant.<br>
- Complete Quests (namely Pet Quests)<br></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What's the most efficient way to gather Building Materials?</b><br>
Here is a quick list of way you can efficiently gather Building Materials:</p><p>

- Turn in items that can gathered quickly en masse such as Bamboo, Straw, Rocks, and Spyder Webs to the Molten Mixer.<br>
- Complete Quests (namely Pet Quests)<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/cc_boo_discoverdacardia.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/toy_3dcrabulator.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What's the most efficient way to increase my Town Level?</b><br>
The most efficent way how to increase your Town Level is by leveling up your Core Buildings. The higher the level of the core building, the more exp gained, so instead of raising 3 different buildings all to level 4, focus on getting one up to max level.</p><p>

You can also increase your Town experience by placing decorations on your island (the larger and/or more recipe complex the decorations are, the more EXP you earn), but in addition, do note that removing decorations from your island decreases your Town experience.</p><p>

Also, completing the Active Quests from the storyline awards Town experience.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What's the giant egg in the Crystal Plateu for?</b><br>
The giant egg in the Crystal Plateu is just an immovable decoration.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why isn't the Trading Post working?</b><br>
The Trading Post is broken on Android and has been temporarily disabled for iOS. When functional, the Trading Post would be a way for players to trade their items for other items within the game. Players were encouraged to use the Trading Post when they needed items from their opposing expansion route (Mystic Jungle/Crystal Plateau).<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/nt_images/619_lutari_inventor.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Does upgrading my Core Buildings do anything?</b><br>
Upgrading your Core Buildings can give you Town Level experience, but aside from that, it just sits there and look pretty.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why do I keep getting these constant tutorial/error messages?</b><br>
The error messages are most occurring when you're crafting/gathering items too quickly, but you shouldn't be in any trouble for that. You'll have a certain amount of items taken away and returned, but you can still create/gather said items afterward. This also appears when you're putting ingredients in the Molten Mixer too quickly. You would want to click one item and do a full slow one-count before clicking anything again. </p><p>

The constant tutorial pop-ups is a known problem, and it is presumed to be worked on.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is the Premium Emporium/Crystal Negg Store worth investing money in?</b><br>
Personally, I would say no, since the game is not exactly functional for In-Game Purchases just yet. It is a personal and financial choice if you do wish to purchase an extra pet (Kacheek, but only available for a limited time at the beginning of your playthrough) and additional decorative items.</p><p> 

You can steadily obtain Crystal Neggs from the Wheel of Offers and Level 3 Daily Goals.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/negg_jewelled.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I raise happiness? </b><br>
You can raise your pet's and overall island happiness by doing any of the following:</p><p>
- Eating Omelettes<br>
- Visiting an Amenity Building<br>
- Painting your Neopet (not recommended)<br>
- Customizing your Neopet (not recommended)</p><p>

Also if your pet levels up it's Affinity then happiness and hunger restored to 100%.</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> NOTE: Paint Brushes and wearables are Single Use. Blank Paint Brush, Blank Roller, Basic Hat are not craftable and at the time only obtainable through the Wheel of Offers for iOS. For Android, Blank Paint Brush, Blank Roller, Basic Hat can be obtained in the Premium Emporium.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I craft X item in Island Builders? </b><br>
I would check out Jellyneo's guide for a crowdsourced compiled list of items that can be crafted in the game.</p><p> 

In the crafting buildings, you can mix and match new craftable items through the Discovery Item section with the except for the Omelette Slab and Workshop. For the Workshop, the equipment cannot be unlocked early, and you can only obtain them through Active Quests. For the Omelette Slab, you will have to match ingredients every time you want to create/discover a specific omelette. For all failed attempts at the Omelette Slab, items will not be returned and your creation will always result in a Dubious Omelette.</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> Jellyneo's Neopets: Island Builders Crafting Guides<br>

<br><p><b>▸ Isn't there an avatar for this game? </b><br>
An avatar for Neopets: Island Builders has been discovered, but the avatar is not currently active, but will most likely be made available in the future.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/lania_avie_islandbuild.gif"></p>

<h3><a name="ticket"></a>Ticket Help Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ Where and how do I make a ticket? </b><br>
You would want to send a ticket through the <a href="//www.neopets.com/help.phtml">official FAQ</a>. It is best to write these tickets in a professional matter.<br>

- Make your subject title short and sweet.<br>
- Always remember to <strong>include your UN</strong>.<br>
- State what you want right away. If this is an account retrieval, then I'd suggest searching for the account recovery question below.<br>
- Avoid humor and emotions. A bit is fine, but you really don't want to go overboard with them.<br>
- Review for ambiguity and make sure your email is clear and free of any spelling mistakes.</p><p>

You will be given a ticket number and the response time varies between 2 hours to 2 months on average.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How can I get TNT to reply to my ticket faster? </b><br>
You would want to do the following if you haven't already:<br>
- Post your ticket number on the Highway to Help thread in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=5">Help NeoBoard Chat</a>.<br>
- Post your ticket number on their Social Media pages.<br>
- Update and promptly respond to your ticket reply (if applicable).</p><p>

If you haven't received your first reply at all after a month, then I would send in another ticket.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Highway to Help thread? </b><br>
The Highway to Help thread (or Ticket Waiting Board) is a place where players can post their ticket numbers for a Neopets staff member to assign to the next available representative within a timely matter.</p><p>

You would always want to read the first post of these threads and also take a look over at the following petpage for posting etiquette.<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> HIGHWAY TO HELP<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Kaizsa">/~Kaizsa</a><br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/frontpage/health_day_2006.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I have a content suggestion to make for TNT. Would it be better to ask in the editorial or support? </b><br>
TNT will take suggestions through both <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editform">the Editorial</a> and their support address at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/help.phtml">official FAQ</a>. You can also try posting your idea on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=2">Ideas / Suggestions NeoBoard Chat</a>.

</p><br><p><b>▸ Can I report a person through tickets? </b><br>
Yes, you can send a report through a support ticket, although it is preferred that you send a report through the <a href="//www.neopets.com/autoform_abuse.phtml?abuse=report">Report Abuse page</a>. 

</p><br><p><b>▸ Can I send a bug report through tickets? </b><br>
Yes, you can send bug reports through a support ticket. You can also send reports through <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editform">the Editorial</a>.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/template_images/biyako_shake_tail.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I ask others to post my ticket number on the Highway to Help thread or share my number when they get answered by TNT Support? </b><br>
You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to share or post someone else's ticket number. Not only is this a safety concern, but you would be held accountable for unintentionally supporting any malicious intent or activity the user might have committed.</p><p>

If you happen to be unable to access your account to post on the thread, you are allowed to make a temporary side account to post on the thread until you regain your old account.

</p><br><p><b>▸ I've heard people request a specific support staff member over another for better ticket help. Does that work? </b><br>
I would say this varies on the situation, but this is often brought up when people are wanting to recover their accounts. People would often ask for Alice W. over Rico S., Tony P., or Delilah D. as it is believed she is more responsive than the others. There are occasions where the ticket information of the assigned tickets are already shared with the other support staff members.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/game_tickets_4.gif"></p>

<h3><a name="account"></a>Account Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ My account got disabled/frozen? How come? </b><br>
An account can be frozen for a variety of reasons, the most common being violations of the Terms of Use/site rules and guidelines, or for protection if your account was compromised. You are advised to send a ticket to support staff to inquire about the freeze as well as any possible steps you can take to recover the account. If the account has not been used in a long time, there is also a possibility it has been purged.

<br><p><b>▸ How can I recover my old account? </b><br>
Send in a ticket to support staff. Remember to provide as much information as you can about the account, from basics such as UN and email to even minute details such as who your Neofriends were. The more information you have, the more likely it is that support will believe you were the original owner of the account. If you are having trouble remembering, you can also request support to give you hints.</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> Note that if the account has not been used in a long time, there is also a possibility it has been purged and cannot be recovered.

<br><p><b>▸ I'm trying to change my E-Mail, but it looks like a bunch of scrambled nonsense. Why is that? </b><br>
Due to privacy laws, TNT did not store your email information if you registered your account when you were less than 13 years old. Id est, that information has been lost and you are advised to send in a ticket to support staff for assistance.

</p><br><p><b>▸ Do I need to contact TNT if I transfer mains? Also, do I need to contact them if I close an account?</b><br>
You do not need to contact TNT if you wish to transfer mains or when you are planning to close an account.

<h1>Premium Membership FAQs</h1>
<p><b>▸ Is Neopets Premium worth it? </b><br>

<br><p><b>▸ Where can I cancel my Premium Membership? </b><br>
You can cancel Neopets Premium under the Premium bar marked <a href="http://nc.neopets.com/managemembership/">Manage Membership</a>.</p><p>

You will be able to continue using your Premium features until the time you paid for Premium is over. Once it is time, you will return to being a regular Neopets member and you will no longer be able to access or be given the following:</p><p> 

- Premium Featured Game<br>

If you quit Premium and then re-subscribe later, any perks that you've previously gained, such as your Premium Neodeck cards, will automatically reappear.

</p><p> In the event you are unable to access your account and you continue to be charged for Premium, then I'd suggest sending a ticket to TNT at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/help.phtml">official FAQ</a> in order to get the problem resolved.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Does Premium Membership ever go on sale? </b><br>
Neopets Premium does go on sale every year around the Fall season. This sale only applies to the Yearly plan at $20 USD off the original price ($69.95 to $49.95). The discount is only accepted in full payment upon purchase and the sale tends to last about a month.</p><p>

Before you decide to purchase the discounted price, think to yourself if you can commit to a whole year of playing Neopets in order to make the most out of this deal.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/msn_buddy/msn_buddy_halloyurble.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I purchase Premium on side accounts? </b><br>
You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to purchase Premium on your side accounts.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How long does it take for Premium Membership to appear on my account? </b><br>
Premium Membership usually takes a few minutes to launch. I would send a ticket if it has been over 12 hours.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are Beauty Contest submissions allowed in Charter? </b><br>
You are allowed to create a thread about your Beauty Contest submissions on the Premium NeoBoard / Charter Chat. This NeoBoard Chat follows the same rules as the Art NeoBoard Chat.</p>

<h3><a name="pperks"></a>Premium Perks Related</h3>
<p><b>▸ I heard I can get any colored species with Premium. Is that true? </b><br>
Premium members are given the Free Species Change perk which does allow you technically obtain nearly every color of converted species (Draiks and Krawks are excluded from this, but the exclusive Ice Bori is possible).</p><p>

How the perk works is that the pet will change its species while keeping its original color. If the species does not come in said color, then you will be given a drop down of all the colors to choose from for that new species! (Example: Lemon Chia to Lutari, but Lemon Lutari do not exist in the Rainbow Pool, so you can choose any possible Lutari color). This perk is the reason why most Chia Morphing Potions and Magical Chia Pops are pricey.</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> Do know that Orange Chias will make the impending species into the color Orange if that is a possible combination. You can check what colors a species does not come in from the link below:<br></p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ Does the Free Species Change perk work on Unconverted Pets? Can I get Unconverted Pets from it?</b><br>
The Free Species Change perk does work on Unconverted Pets, but it will convert the pet. You cannot get Unconverted Pets from the perk.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/pets/sad/hissi_mutant_baby.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the difference between the Shop Wizard and the Super Shop Wizard? </b><br>
Regular Shop Wizard:<br>
- Randomly searches through many groups of shops depending on the usershop's UN. <br>
- No definite indicator that the item is not for sale in any usershop.<br>
- The Search Limit is 360 searches per each new hour.<br>
- You can search for any Non-Neocash item.<br></p><p>

Super Shop Wizard:<br>
- Will give you the usershops with the lowest prices instantly on demand.<br>
- Will tell you if the item is not for sale in any usershop.<br>
- The Search Limit is about less than 75-100 searches per each new hour.<br>
- You are not allowed to directly search for most of the following: Lab Map Pieces, Nerkmids, Paint Brushes, Petpet Lab Map Pieces, Petpet Paint Brushes, and Transmogrification Potions (newer PBs/PPBs/Transmogs are allowed, however).<br>
- You are given the Price Only (limited) option that will allow you to search for any Non-Neocash item, but it will not tell you which usershop.<br>
- The ability to search with wildcard operators (%) to randomize your searches. <br></p><p>

Both:<br>
- Frozen Shops can appear.<br>
- Gallery search functions are the same.<br>
- Petpet Park items can be found.<br></p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is SSW Sniping? </b><br>
SSW Sniping is when Premium members use the Super Shop Wizard to look out for higher priced items at a (sometimes accidental, sometimes intentionally marked) low price. Most people would use Jellyneo's IDB as a start, but there is a special trick to Super Shop Wizard of using wildcard operators (%) in your search. It'll allow you to easily look around for certain items like specially colored Morphing Potions (Example: COLOR % Morphing Potion). There is usually a thread in the Charter Chat where people share their SSW Snipe findings.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Let's say I'm currently using my extra pet slot and my Premium ends, what happens? </b><br>
You'll be given a grace period to purchase pet slots (if applicable), or transfer out or abandon a selected pet if you hit your maximum amount (the default is 10 pets without any additional pet slots). If you choose to abandon a pet, it will be stuck in Pound Limbo for 90 days where only you can see it. After 90 days have passed, the pet will be available for anyone to adopt (if you have not made a decision in those 90 days, then a random pet will be selected to be abandoned to the pound).</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> If you abandon a Lutari, you will not be able to re-adopt the pet back.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ So, when do I get my Monthly Premium Bonus Collectibles? </b><br>
A new Monthly Premium Bonus Collectible is given out on the 15th of every month. If you happen to sign up for Premium prior the 15th, you would be given the latest collectible.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_spacefaeriedoll.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why didn't I get a new Space Faerie Scratchcard? </b><br>
Every Friday, Premium members are given one Space Faerie Scratchcard. You have to be subscribed to Premium for at least a week in order to get your first Space Faerie Scratchcard.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_sc_mirabook.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ When is the best time to scratch Space Faerie Scratchcards?</b><br>
The best time to scratch Space Faerie Scratchcards is when you have the Full Pockets Obelisk Boon.</p><p>

The boon gives you a boosted amount of Neopoints with every win. You 1,000 NP with every item reward.

</p><br><p><b>▸ What is the Space Faerie Vending Machine? Am I missing out on anything there?</b><br>
The Space Faerie Vending Machine is a Premium exclusive feature where users can use their Mysterious Tokens, won from the Faerie Scratchcards, to win items such Codestones, Dubloons, etc. Mysterious Tokens are extremely rare and you're not missing much. You can check out the prizes here:<br></p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ How strong do I have to be to beat Jetsam Ace and/or Giant Space Fungus? </b><br>
Who you want to fight depends on your pet's stats, budget, and your own personal stance on where or if you want to stop at a certain point of fighting a specific opponent.</p><p>

Jetsam Ace on Easy Difficulty is recommended to be fought at Level 50 and 55 STR in order to OHKO him. You can fight him at a STR and Level lower than that, but you would at least want to be at 35 STR and with a similar Defense and/or high HP to make up for it. If you want to fight him at a higher difficulty, then I would recommend training your STR to 85 for Medium and then 125 (200 STR to always OHKO) for Mighty.</p><p>

In order to OHKO Giant Space Fungus on Mighty Difficulty (Medium/Hard mode Jetsam Ace has higher rarity rewards than Easy/Medium Giant Space Fungus) for his Bubbling Fungus rewards, then it is reasonably affordable, albeit more tedious, to fight him at Level 200 and 400 STR in order to 3HKO him. You would need to be at 750+ STR and have a weapon budget of ~20m if you wanted to OHKO him.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/betterthanyou/contestant674.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything special about Premium Cards?</b><br>
Premium Cards are really just nice collectibles that you get every month. They disappear once your Premium ends, but they do reappear once you subscribe again.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What's the Customisation Journal good for? </b><br>
The Customisation Journal is really just a place sharing customizations you have made on-site through a catalog. Viewers can check out what items were put on the pet at the time and give "Likes" on your entries. You may make up to 6 entries per day. Also, you get to keep your journal once your Premium ends although you won't be able to add/edit entries. </p><p>

As a more practical option for sharing customizations, Dress to Impress and Jellyneo's Wardrobe do have a feature for sharing customizions more easily and quickly than the Customisation Journal. It does not require Premium either.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/journal/albumthumb.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What's special about the Premium Neoboards? </b><br>
They are really just an extra side chat where users can talk about pretty much anything like Beauty Contest, Caption Contest, etc. NP Trades, NC Trades, Pet Trades, and more can also be found here.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about Premium Membership? </b><br>
If you have any questions about Neopets Premium, don't hesistate to ask the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=5">Help NeoBoard Chat</a> or <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/premium.phtml">Premium NeoBoard Chat (Premium only)</a> for help with your queries! <br></p><p>

<h1>NC Mall FAQs</h1>
<p><b>▸ What is Neocash?</b><br>
Neocash (NC) is a Neopian currency with which you can use to acquire an assortment of wearables, site boons, etc. in exchange for real-money. You can use Neocash to purchase NC items from the NC Mall.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/common/stack_of_nc.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Do I need Neocash to enjoy the game? </b><br>
Neocash is completely optional and not necessary for average gameplay.</p>

<h3><a name="ncbasics"></a>Neocash Basics Related</h3>

<p><b>▸ How does one obtain Neocash? </b><br>
You can purchase Neocash from the following:<br>
- On-site over <a href="http://secure.nc.neopets.com/get-nickcash">here</a>.<br>
- NC Cards <a href="http://nc.neopets.com/nickcash-cards">over here</a>.</p><p>

You can obtain Neocash/NC items from the following reoccurring dailies/Events:<br>
- Advent Calendar<br>
- Altador Cup<br>
- Charity Corner<br>
- Daily Dare (prior 2012)<br>
- The Money Tree<br>

<br><p><b>▸ How long does it take for Neocash to appear on my account?</b><br>
If you are purchasing Neocash directly from the site, the estimated time is 2 minutes to 2 months, and longer if done with PP. Neocash Cards are usually instant and they have more incentives, such as additional Neocash and Gift Boxes, than buying on-site.</p><p>

You might want to submit a ticket to TNT at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/help.phtml">official FAQ</a> if you have not received your NC within a week.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to purchase Neocash on my side accounts? </b><br>
You are allowed to purchase Neocash on your side acconuts.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a certain time when new NC items are released? </b><br>
New Neocash content tends to be released around 10am - Noon NST on the weekdays and sometimes through Future Fashions. Event NC items are usually released before or around the same time the NC Event is launched.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Future Fashions? </b><br>
Future Fashions is a special NC Mall shop for players that have spent 10,000 NC ($100 USD) in the prior month. Future Fashion items are moved to the public NC Mall after 72 hours (3 days) of their initial release.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/nt_images/632_zylphia.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What does this acronym/phrase mean in the NC Mall Chat? </b><br>
I'd check out <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Xheoi">/~Xheoi</a> for a more current list of NC Mall related acronyms and phrases. For general terminology, you could check out Jellyneo's Dictionary.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What do Noda's Fortune Cookies do? </b><br><a href="http://ncmall.neopets.com/mall/fortune/">Noda's Fortune Cookies</a> are special NC consumables that can give you site boons, wearables, and other fun activities to do on the site! All Fortune Cookies have a limited amount of stock, but you only really see Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies getting sold out during the Faerie Quest Event, because they're 50% off during that time.</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I get rid of Neocash items? </b><br>
You can do either of the following:<br>
- Gift them out to other members using Gift Boxes<br>
- Donate them with Upcycle Cookies (Upcycled items will turn into a cheap buyable in the Money Tree)<br>
- Do Kaia Quests (requires NC)<br>
- Charity Corner them (requires NC)<br>
- Discard them directly through the item's page</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I delete Basic Gift Boxes? </b><br>
You can delete Basic Gift Boxes through any of the following:<br>
- Use them to gift/trade NC items to others.<br>
- Send yourself a random NC item.<br>
- Do Kaia Quests (requires NC).<br></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Elite Boutique? </b><br>
The Elite Boutique is a special NC Mall shop reserved for member's accounts that are 49 months old (4+ years). This shop can be found in the top right corner of the NC Mall page with the <img src="//images.neopets.com/ncmall/experienceduser_icon.png"> star icon. All the items in this shop are No-Trade. TNT has not released any new items nor retired anything from this shop for about a decade.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/376_nc_mall.gif"></p>

<h3><a name="nctrade"></a>NC Trading Related</h3>

<p><b>▸ How does one trade Neocash items? </b><br>
I would check out <a href="/~Helper">/~Helper</a> for how to start out NC Trading! The basics of NC Trading are as follows:<br>
- You are trading with another Neopets player.<br>
- You are only allowed to trade NC Items for other NC Items.<br>
- You are both using Gift Boxes in order to send the NC Items.<br>
- Most, but not all, trades usually reference item values of the NC Items.<br>
- All trades are built on trust from both sides to deliver the items to their destined accounts.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_giftbox_basic.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I just did a trade, but who accepts their side first? </b><br>
There's no rule on who should accept first, but it is courteous to accept when both sides have exchanged their sent item messages. The general etiquette about accepting first:<br>
- You want to make sure the other side got their items (big trades, Neomail error, etc.).<br>
- A side is boxless and has to open the, presumably traded, Gift Box Capsules in order to trade.<br>
- A side might about to log off for a long period of time and won't be able to accept their side of trade immediately.</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> NOTE: It's generally advisable to copy and paste the confirmation message you get from sending the item (add x2 or x3 if you're sending multiple) as an extra layer of verification that you completed your half of the trade. E.g. Congratulations! Your gift has been delivered to UN. You will receive a Neomail updating you on the status of your gift within 48 hours. Thank you.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What happens when I send the NC item to the wrong account? Will I get my Gift Box back?</b><br>
You would want to NM the account you sent the item to immediately (if you can recall the UN) and see if they will return the item to you (most people will). When the NC item is rejected, you will get the item and gift box back.</p><p>

In the past, if you have sent an NC item to the wrong account, it would have been returned back to you in 48 hours if no action was taken. The feature is now broken and you'll need to send in a ticket if you want the item back if the account looks to be inactive.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/caption/sm_caption_618.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is a Gift Box Capsule/Cube? </b><br>
Gift Box Capsules/Cubes (or GBCs) are the item currency of NC Trading. They are mystery capsules that are commonly opened for the 2 to 5 Gift Boxes inside (the 5th Gift Box being a Limited Edition Gift Box). They cost 200 NC and can also award a random item (or two if the GBC has 5 Gift Boxes) in the NC Mall worth around 150 NC.</p><p>

Gift Box Capsules are usually sold towards the end of each month and very rarely appear in Future Fashions nowadays. They are discounted to 25%-50% off during Black Friday and the Spring Cleaning Sale.</p><p>

Prior May 2014, Gift Box Capsules used to have a more cylindrical shape and awarded items differently in comparison to the newer cubic variants. They awarded 1 to 5 Gift Boxes (the 5th Gift Box being a Limited Edition Gift Box) and the random NC Mall item (or two) was worth around 200 NC. The cylinder shaped capsules were the same price of 200 NC.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_gbmc_hocuspocus.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_gbmc_cherryblossom.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_gbmc_rainbow.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_gbmc_lemonysplash.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_gbmc_winterstarlightgb.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How does one get more Basic Gift Boxes? </b><br>
You can get more Gift Boxes by doing any of the following:<br>
- Open Gift Box Capsules<br>
- Redeem NC Cards<br>
- Trudy's Surprise (on your main account only)</p><p>

Unfortunately, you cannot put a Basic (or special) Gift Box inside a Basic (or special) Gift Box.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is a Value Check thread? </b><br>
A Value Check (or VC) thread is a thread on the NC Mall NeoBoard where you are asking people what they have traded recently for a certain item, or have seen an item trade for recently. It is one of the best ways to keep yourself safe and up-to-date while trading.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/nt_images/634_hubrid_auction.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What does 2:1 mean? </b><br>
2:1 usually refers to a type of "sale" where someone offers two of their items for one Gift Box capsule, Archive Cookie, or other item. Not all traders would have a 2:1 sale and some might do 3:2 (three items for two GBCs), so as to ensure they will have 1 Basic Gift Box after the trade.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where would I go to find Neocash Trades? </b><br>
You can find Neocash Trades mainly at the following:<br>
- NC Mall NeoBoard Chat<br>
- Dress to Impress (via Neomails)<br>
- Jellyneo's Item Database (via Neomails)</p><p>

If you are new/returning to NC Trading, then the safest place to conduct NC trades is through the NeoBoards.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/155_pets_postoffice.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I set up a tradelist/wishlist? </b><br>
I would check out <a href="/~Helper">/~Helper</a> again! Tradelists/Wishlist are not necessary for NC Trading, but it is preferred to have one if you are going to be trading NC items every now and then.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Which place is the best to make a tradelist? DTI, JN, Gallery, Petpage, NC Album, etc.?</b><br>
DTI and/or JN are a great start to making a tradelist for NC Trading!</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/monocle.gif"> Dress to Impress (DTI):<br>
- Most preferred place to start an NC Tradelist/Wishlist.<br>
- Simplistic user interface.<br>
- Fluid List Comparison Tool.<br>
- Items can be easily removed from Tradelist.<br>
- You can import items from your Closet/SDB.<br>
- You can export items from your petpages.<br>
- You can add a description to each DTI section.<br>
- Tradelist/Wishlist are shared with a DTI URL.<br>
- Up For Trade/Seeking sections are only indicated by those who have set their sections to "Trading" status.<br>
- Up For Trade/Seeking placing is based on when you added the item to your list.<br>
- Non-Wearables cannot be listed.<br>
- You cannot assign values to the NC items, unlike Jellyneo.</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> Jellyneo (JN): <br>
- Find Trade feature to instantly compare user's list.<br>
- Top Priority Feature above regular items.<br>
- You can assign values to the NC items.<br>
- Non-Wearables can be listed.<br>
- Has an automatic Last Updated text.<br>
- Up For Trade/Seeking placing is based on when you last updated the section (added/removed an item).<br>
- You can import items from your Closet/SDB.<br>
- You can export items from your petpages.<br>
- Tradelist/Wishlist are shared with a JN URL.<br>
- The List Comparison Tool is clunky.<br>
- No description space.<br>
- Keeping tradelists/wishlists updated is more difficult than DTI.<br>
- Unfavorable user interface for a number of NC traders.</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> Petpages:<br>
- No linking offsite.<br>
- You can personalize with your own layouts and whatnot.<br>
- Constant multi-page updating.<br>

- No special DTI/JN features.<br>
- Longer Loading Times.<br>
- Possible account security issues with shady Neopians.</p><p>

- Gallery Size can be expensive.</p><p> 

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> NC Albums:<br>
- No, just don't.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why can't I link my DTI/JN URL? </b><br>
You might want to remove some parts of the URL:<br>
- The starting https://www. part needs to be taken out.<br>
- Long DTI UNs might need to be removed or be broken into parts.<br>
- JN TL URLs might sometimes be weird for NM trades if you end with the URL. Just link it in the top or middle of your post (just put any text after the JN TL URL).</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How long does one usually wait for the other person to respond back? </b><br>
You would usually want to wait 24-48 hours for them to respond back to an NC trade or Dyework Lend. We all can't be on Neopets 24/7 and sudden events in real life might need our priority at the moment.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/350_zafara_waiting.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are Neomail Neocash trades safe? </b><br>
Neomail Neocash trades are generally safe if you are an experienced NC trader. They are useful for making possible quick trades, finding trades over from DTI/Jellyneo, and for general convenience!</p><p> 

For new or returning NC traders, it is recommended that you trade through the NeoBoards as it is easy to be scammed through Neomail trading. You should always create a Value Check thread if you are unsure of the fairness of a trade.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are these Neocash Shuffle threads? </b><br>
A Neocash/NC Mall Shuffle is NC Mall Chat game in where members list their NC Items/Custom for random offers by anyone for fun! Just do know that there's a risk to the listers on the inevitable aspect of accepting trades and those trades won't always go well.

</p><p>As this is a Neopets Trading game, Neocash items will be traded for other Neocash items. Pets/Neopoints/NP Items are <strong>NOT</strong> to be involved in these trades. More information can be found in the following petpage:</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is a Popular? </b><br>
Populars (or Pops) are highly sought out NC wearables due to their well-liked appearance. These NC wearables can be difficult to trade for, have fluctuating values, and/or are generally known by seasoned NC traders. Trade carefully if you do have these items and as a quick reference, the following petpage should entail most notable wearables: </p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to trade Neocash items from my side accounts? </b><br>
You are allowed to trade Neocash items from your side accounts although do be careful and make sure that you are actually trading with the same person.

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to trade Neocash items for things other than Neocash items? </b><br>
You are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to trade NC items for things other than NC items. Only NC items for NC items is allowed.</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 438 | Question 4 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=438">link</a>]<p>
<strong> First of all, I would like to thank you guys for letting us trade Neocash items. That said, I was wondering if we could trade Neocash items for Neopoint items as long as both parties agreed? For example, say someone wants one of my Neocash items that I have up for trade, but they don't have a Neocash item to exchange for it. They do have a Neopoint item to trade, though. As long as that person agrees and doesn't feel scammed in any way, could we do this? ~chuppacabrashelper</strong></p><p>No. Even if both parties agree, trading Neocash items for Neopoint ones (and vice versa) is not allowed. These are two separate economies and they are not allowed to intermingle as it would terribly unbalance both economies and become greatly unfair to players who choose not to use the NC Mall.</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to participate in NC events on my side accounts? </b><br>
Nowadays, you are allowed to participate in pretty much all NC events on your side accounts. Always double check with the FAQ of the aforementioned event if you're really unsure.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to gift/giveaway/contest off Neocash items? </b><br>
You are allowed to gift NC items, but TNT have stated that giveaway threads <i>varies</i> on the degree of subjectivity.

<strong> I recently put up a gifting board for NC items I no longer use. I've done this several times before. This time though, I suppose someone reported it and when I got up the next day I found a "gentle reminder" from TNT telling me such boards were not permitted. The board was gone. I was simply trying to help fellow Neopians. I looked up some old editorials and it did say they are NOT permitted because it encourages begging. OK. So yesterday, someone else did the same thing and nothing happens to them. Board is still and I know a few people reported it.</strong></p><p>I'm so sorry that happened! However, it's definitely not a black and white issue, it is pretty much up to the monitors discretion whether a board is crossing the line.

<strong> Just wondering if we are allowed to do NC/NP item giveaways. It's our choice and our (real life) money. Can TNT tell us what we can do with it? ~ psychoan.alysis</strong></p><p>You're right - your items and money, you can do what you want with them and give them to whomever you'd like. What you can't do is openly advertise that you're giving away items, as it invites begging, which is not allowed :)</p></div>

<p>You are allowed and only permitted to host contest off NC items through Guilds activities and within your guildmates.

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about the rules of Neocash? </b><br>
If you are ever unsure if something is allowed/disallowed in terms of Neocash related topics, then it doesn't hurt to ask the NC Mall NeoBoard Chat, Help NeoBoard Chat, or Charter NeoBoard Chat (Premium Only). Neocash is real money, so you will definitely find someone that is knowledgable about the rules and regulations of Neocash.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are there any NC events that are NOT optional to the main event? </b><br>
Nope! All NC events are optional and have no impact on any progress in any main Neopets event.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What and when is the Super Sale? </b><br>
The NC Mall Super Sale is an annual NC Mall event that occurs during the weekends of January. The NC Mall will discount all the wearables of a specified category (usually Backgrounds, Clothes, and Trinkets) by 50% off and release three new wearables in that same category. These sales only last the weekend.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_trink_sprinklesnow.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_bg_luxbedroom.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_clo_denimcoat.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Didn't Super Sale use to be something completely different? </b><br>
That is correct! Super Sales used to be large NC events where TNT would retire tons of previously "permanent" NC Mall buyables at a discounted price. This was to make room for new "permanent" NC Mall buyables and the discounted ones would soon be retired for good.

It wasn't just limited to separate wearables, but these sales contained Superpacks, Specialty Capsules, Neohome items, and more! This style of Super Sales ended somewhere around 2013 along with its mass introduction and discounted retirement of NC wearables. You can read more about old Super Sales here:</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> Super Saled: The Super Sale FAQ<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Fibbyck">/~Fibbyck</a></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are NC Grams? </b><br>
NC Grams are gift-giving items with NC wearables inside. These grams contain 4-7 (usually 5) wearables with a chance of a Limited Edition item inside. As these are gift-giving items, you do not need to use a Gift Box to send these away! These are usually sold around Valentine's Day (with some seasonal releases) and they each cost 200 NC.</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/pteri.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/sun.gif"> Jellyneo's and SunnyNeo's NC Grams Articles<br>
jellyneo.net/?go=sweetheart_gram<br>
sunnyneo.com/customisation/NCgrams.php</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Would I have to buy an NC Gram on a side account or trade with someone if I want the NC Gram item on my main account? </b><br>
Luckily, you can send NC Grams to yourself.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_gram_easterbaby.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_gram_maraquaneaster.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_gram_mutanteaster.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I check if my NC Gram has the Limited Edition item? </b><br>
You'll have to manually check each gram to see if there's another wearable in the item's dropdown. Also, while this is an extremely rare occurrence with older grams, it is recommended that you seperate any grams that have the Limited Edition item from the others that do not. Since old LE and LE-less grams have the same ID, putting them together will merge them and they will all become LE-less, so put the LE grams in your Gallery in order to keep them apart just in case.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Isn't there an NC portion to the main Festival of Neggs event? </b><br>
Yes, there is in fact an NC portion to the main Festival of Neggs event! The style of the NC portion has changed a couple of times throughout the years, but we are now following a more consistent style of having three free NC Mystery Negg items and using specialty items (125 NC Dust or 600 NC Tinker Kit) on them. Each of those Mystery Negg items will reward five wearables with an additional item if you redeem all five wearables within them.</p><p>

The only time a bonus item was rewarded by fully redeeming all three Mystery Neggs was in 2020's event. Despite the three Mystery Neggs being given out for free, the NC portion is completely optional and does not affect the main event in any way.</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/pteri.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/sun.gif"> Fansite Festival of Neggs Articles and Guides<br>

<br><p><b>▸ So, I got a bunch of NC Neggs from the past Festival of Negg Events and I don't have the retired items to open them. Am I just stuck with them forever? </b><br>
You don't have to be stuck with them! You can do any of the following:</p><p>

- Discard them by going through their item page in the Inventory.<br>
- Upcycle them with NC Upcycle Fortune Cookies.<br>
- Discard them with Charity Corner packs (when the event is active).<br>
- Gift / Trade them away to other players with Gift Boxes.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I heard GBCs are sometimes discounted. When would that be? </b><br>
Gift Box Capsules/Cubes (GBCs) are discounted on two different events, the Black Friday Sale and the Spring Cleaning Sale.</p><p>

The Black Friday GBC Sale happens around the week of Black Friday in November and usually lasts about one day (aside from 2020's sale lasting longer than that). For the first 12 hours of Black Friday NST, the new monthly GBC is released, and it is discounted by 50% off (100 NC). For the remaining 12 hours, they are discounted by 25% off (125 NC) the original GBC price.</p><p>

The Spring Cleaning GBC Sale usually happens around April and is a day longer than the Black Friday GBC Sale. Instead of a new GBC, five GBCs released within the last year will be rereleased during the sale. For the first day of the sale, GBCs are 50% off (100 NC) and for the next day, they are 25% off (125 NC) their original price.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_gbmc_fantasticfall.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_gbmc_loomeclipse.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_gbmc_kaleidoscopecolors.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_gbmc_wood.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_mc_linen&amp;lacegbmc.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are discounted GBCs valued less/more than regular GBCs?</b><br>
Unless the discounted GBCs are a couple of years old from their latest release, then no, they are neither valued less nor more than a regular monthly GBC.</p><p>

The only current controversial instance where values might be discussed more thoroughly is with the Kaleidoscope Dreams Gift Box Mystery Capsules released on November 27, 2020. Those GBCs give out 4-7 Gift Boxes instead of the average 2-5 amount, but those GBCs can be a little tricky, since TNT released two different versions of the item with the same name, image, and description. Their Item IDs can be used identify them; the 11/27 GBCs (4-7 Gift Boxes) Item ID is 81979, and the 11/28-30 GBCs (2-5 Gift Boxes) Item ID is 81816. There is no way to identify which Item ID you'll receive upon accepting them.</p><p>

People do have the right to value their items lower or higher than others, but no one is obliged to make a trade if one side feels the trade might be unfair without informed consent. If you ever feel unsure about a trade, then it is best to make a Value Check (VC) Thread on the NC Mall NeoBoard Chat.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Does TNT discount Fortune Cookies? </b><br>
TNT does discount Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies during the Faerie Quest Event which is in the Springtime. There has also been one instance where TNT discounted Training and NC Archives cookies by 50% off during the 2020's Black Friday Sale. It is unknown if they will ever discount those again.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I get Crafting Faerie Quests? </b><br>
Crafting Faerie (or Delina) Quests are only available during the Faerie Quest Event. You receive them after completing any Faerie Quest during the Faerie Quest Event. She cannot be summoned by Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies.</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/pteri.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/sun.gif"> Fansite Delina Quests Articles and Guides<br>

<br><p><b>▸ Is completing Crafting Faerie Quests a requirement if I want the end bonus reward of the Faerie Quest Event? </b><br>
Faerie Quest Event?
No, you do not have to complete Crafting Faerie Quests or Kaia Quests in order to get the end bonus reward. You just have to visit the Main Quest Page every day of the event to get the bonus reward.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can I use the Quest Refresh Boon on Crafting Faerie Quests? </b><br>
Yes, you can use the Quest Refresh Boon on Crafting Faerie Quests although be warned that there is a significant chance that you may not receive any more of Delina's quests for the rest of the event after refreshing her.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How long can I hold onto a Crafting Faerie Quest? </b><br>
As Faerie Quests do not expire, you may hold onto a Crafting Faerie Quest for as long as you like although do know you cannot use the Shop Wizard (and Super Shop Wizard) while the quest is active.</p><p>

We're not exactly sure why older Crafting Faerie Quest ingredients are still being sold when the later ingredients were retired, so you might want to purchase/trade for the items before they retire or just reject the quest if the item's not too special.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_quest_metal.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Isn't there an NC portion to the Altador Cup event? </b><br>
Yes, there is an NC portion to the Altador Cup event! The style of the NC portion has changed a couple of times throughout the years, but we are now following a more consistent style of having an item pack system with a bonus item at the end if you redeemed every one of each item. The characters that host the NC portion to the Altador Cup change every year, and the NC wearables are usually themed after the environment of Altador and the Altador Cup itself.</p><p>

For this event, you are allowed to wait until the last day of the event to see if you like any of the items before trading/purchasing a pack. You are also allowed to redeem up to five multiples of the same item although multiples will not count towards the bonus item.</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/sun.gif"> SunnyNeo's Past Altador Cup NC pages<br>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to participate in the NC portion of the Altador Cup event on a side account? </b><br>
Yes, you are allowed to participate in the NC portion of the Altador Cup event on a side account despite having to join a team to enter the page. Just keep in mind that your side accounts should not participate in any other AC activities that can give you NP/NP items (games, Staff Tournament, etc.) and you should discard the item prizes you get when signing up on a side.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Isn't there an NC portion to the Daily Dare/Games Master Challenge event? </b><br>
Yes, there is an NC portion to the Daily Dare event! Most, if not all, of the Daily Dare NC events, are hosted by AAA and Abigail's cousin, Lulu.</p><p>

In terms of the Daily Dare event, the type of NC wearables Lulu gives out is related to the theme of the event (i.e. saving Roo Island, exploring space, etc.). DD sells a variety of event passes ranging anywhere from single packs, five packs, ten packs, and twenty packs.</p><p>

In terms of the Games Master Challenge event, the type of NC wearables Lulu gives out is related to the games she asks you to play (i.e. submitting a score in Bruno's Backwoods Breakaway and Chemistry for Beginners rewards you the NC wearable, Tree of Potions). GMC only sells a single event pass which is usually at 700 NC.</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> Jellyneo's Past DD/GMC pages<br>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to participate in the NC portion to the Daily Dare/Games Master Challenge event on my side accounts? </b><br>
For the Daily Dare event, you are allowed to participate in the NC portion of the event on your side accounts. This does not mean you are allowed to participate in any activities that can reward NP/NP items (i.e. submit game score).</p><p>

For the Games Master Challenge event, you are NOT allowed to participate in the NC portion of the event on your side accounts. Lulu requires you to actually play and submit game scores in order to get the NC wearables.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Does anything notable happen on the NC Mall's birthday? </b><br>
In celebration of the NC Mall's birthday in July, TNT releases three free No-Trade stat-boosting cupcakes/cakes with an NC wearable inside each one. You are allowed to collect these on your side accounts.</p><p>

Aside from that, TNT also releases the Wish Candles and Birthday Rerelease Mystery Capsules.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_cake_piece.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_80X80_bday_cake_2.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_cake_piece_3.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Wish Candles? </b><br>
Wish Candles are essentially specialty capsules in a different shape. They usually contain 5 regular NC wearables and 1 Limited Edition Bonus NC wearable. Three Candles are released every year with the release date usually being within the month of the NC Mall's birthday. They cost 150 NC each.</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/sun.gif"> Jellyneo's and SunnyNeo's Wish Candle Pages<br>

<br><p><b>▸ What is the Haunted Mansion/Hijinks?</b><br>
The Haunted Mansion (formally Haunted Hijinks) is an NC event during the month of October where players can purchase Mallet/Candle packs and get Halloween themed NC wearables. If you redeem a certain number of packs, you will receive additional Halloween themed Gift Boxes with the NC wearables. A bonus item is included if you have redeemed all the NC wearables, so there's that for an incentive.</p><p>

For this event, you are allowed to wait until the last day of the event to see if you like any of the items before trading/purchasing a pack.</p><p>

You can only redeem one of each item per account, but you are allowed to participate on your side accounts.</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/sun.gif"> Jellyneo's and SunnyNeo's Haunted Mansion Articles<br>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Stocking Stufftacular? </b><br>
Stocking Stufftacular is an NC event during the month of December where players can purchase Stocking Stufftacular packs and get Christmas/Winter themed NC wearables. If you redeem a certain number of packs, you will receive additional Winter themed NC wearables with the normal NC wearables. A bonus item is included if you have redeemed all the NC wearables, so there's that for an incentive.</p><p>

There's also the incentive of participating in the event (whether that be a single pack or the largest pack) to get the Community Reward which is just an extra Christmas/Winter themed NC wearable.</p><p>

For this event, you have to redeem your Stocking Stufftacular packs before the day the NC items are given out. Once the day has arrived, the item is officially retired.</p><p>

You can only redeem five of each item per account, and you are allowed to participate on your side accounts.</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/sun.gif"> Jellyneo's and SunnyNeo's Stocking Stufftacular Articles<br>

<br><p><b>▸ Is the Stocking Stufftacular worth it? </b><br>
If you like Christmas/Winter themed NC wearables and liked the NC wearables from the previous years, then that's up to you. Full redemption bonuses can be or hit or miss, and it is a gamble to redeem multiple packs for an item you've never seen before. </p>

<br><p><b>▸ How does the NC portion to the Charity Corner event work? </b><br>
Essentially, the event is quite similar to how NC Upcycle Fortune Cookies work with a prize shop system attached. You buy these Charity Corner donation packs to donate (discard) unwanted NC items for Donation Badges which can be redeemed for NC wearables.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_acc_mermaidwig.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_cc18_30.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_trink_cozy_xmas_fg.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Does the NC Donations count toward the main Charity Corner event donation count? </b><br>
NC donations do <b>NOT</b> count towards totals for final prizes. </p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Dyeworks? </b><br>
Dyeworks are certain existing NC wearables that come in different color variations! At Loic's Dyeworks Studio, players can use Dyeworks Hue Brew Potions to dye their items into different colors (and get their original back of course). You can read more about Dyeworks over at these guides:</p><p> 
<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/pteri.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/sun.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> Dyeworks Guides<br>

thedailyneopets.com/customization-wearables/dyeworks<br>
sunnyneo.com/customisation/ncmall/NCdyeworks.php</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I dye an item? </b><br>
You will first want to check if the item is available to dye at Loic's Dyeworks Studio. There are permanently dyeable items and there are items that have been retired from the Dyeworks Studio. If the item is available to dye, then you will have to obtain the original item and a Dyeworks Hue Brew Potion. Go visit Loic's Dyeworks Studio and select the original item in the wearables section below to dye said item.</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> NOTE: The item you receive will be randomly selected for you. You cannot choose which color item you'll receive.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_acc_gold_body_dust.gif"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xpEeI33.png"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_acc_markingsblue.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_acc_markingsilver.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_acc_markingspink.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why can't I dye X item? </b><br>
Here's a quick list of reasons why you cannot dye X item:<br>
- The item is retired.<br>
- You do not have the original item and/or a Dyeworks Hue Brew Potion.<br>
- You do not have JS enabled.<br></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How does Dyeworks Lending work? </b><br>
Dyeworks Lending is when someone lends you the original item to dye in exchange for a GBC (if two items), Fortune Cookie, or small wishlist item.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ When are new Dyeworks items released? </b><br>
New Dyeworks items are usually released seasonally and are available for a limited time only.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ If I purchase a Dyeworks Bundle, does it activate automatically or not? </b><br>
Dyeworks Bundles activate immediately upon purchase.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything special about the Advent Calendar Dyeworks Hue Brew Potions? </b><br>
Advent Calendar Dyeworks Hue Brew Potions function the same as the regular Dyeworks Hue Brew Potion.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_80X80_dyeworks_holiday.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_dyeworks_winter.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_80X80_dyeworks_festive.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_dyeworks_advent.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Mysterious Morphing Experiments? </b><br>
Mysterious Morphing Experiments (or MMEs) are NC wearables that periodically transform into different wearables. They are typically only available to be purchased for a week or two before their retirement, after which they begin morphing into other items! These items will transform into multiple wearables (and all transformations will be in your inventory at the end).<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/ncmall/mme/popups/mme-2.jpg"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is an Item ID and how is that related to MMEs? How does one find item IDs? </b><br>
MMEs are divided into two Item IDs (MiniMMEs are one Item ID) that associate with their thematic transformation. You can find out what the MME's ID is by following the instructions from these two JN pages:</p><p> 
<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> Finding (MME) Item IDs<br>
jellyneo.net/?go=mmexperiments<br>
items.jellyneo.net/contribute/item-ids/</p>

<br><p><b>▸ My MME just changed into a different wearable. Why is that? </b><br>
That is the magic of Mysterious Morphing Experiments! They will transform anywhere from your SDB, Closet (and pets), Gallery, and Inventory. They will stop morphing once their stages have been completed and you will get all the items in your inventory.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why is the MME on DTI/JN's Wardrobe weird? </b><br>
Mysterious Morphing Experiments don't register quickly or easily into these customization fansites. The transformation has to be completed before they can be fully modeled.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/stage6_foreground_80x80.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I heard MMEs have an additional Bonus item. How does one get that? </b><br>
MME bonuses are randomly awarded with each initial MME. If you have multiple MMEs, then you have a better chance of getting a bonus (or multiple).</p>

<br><p><b>▸ When are new Mysterious Morphing Experiments released? </b><br>
Nowadays, we only get one new MME per year. TNT has stopped doing MiniMMEs.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/ncmall/homepage/2015/mall_minimme-20.jpg"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Rerelease Capsules? </b><br>
Rerelease Capsules (or RR Caps) are Mystery Capsules that are filled with items that have been retired. Usually they have lots of different items so getting a specific one can be almost impossible. Most let you pick either by year, or by item type e.g. Accessories, Backgrounds and Trinkets, Clothing.</p><p> There are many types of Rerelease Capsules, most common are the Seasonal ones such as: Fall (which contain items released during Fall), Winter, Summer, Spring and sometimes holiday ones like Christmas or Halloween. They are not released every year though, TNT may go long periods before releasing these.</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> Jellyneo's Mystery Capsule Article<br>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Shenanigifts? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/games/we/">Shenanigifts</a> is an NC Mall Game where players can join a party full of costumed Elephantes, and receive gifts from the attending guests. To play, you must purchase a Shenanigifts Invitation Pack and enter in one of the three available parties. You can speak to three different guests to see what NC wearables they have to gift, but once you speak to a guest you must reject their offer if you wish to see what the next guest is offering. If you reach the third guest without accepting anything, you are forced to accept the third guest's item unless you have the Second Look Power-Up.</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/pteri.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/sun.gif"> Fansite Shenanigifts Articles and Guides<br>

<br><p><b>▸ What is Patapult? </b><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/mall/patapult/">Patapult</a> is an NC Mall bowling game with a prize shop system for NC wearables. How the game works is that you click on the Patamoose and slowly drag your mouse towards the lower "lip" of the holes. You'll have three tries and whatever totem you get for your third attempt is the one you'll be taking home if you didn't claim a totem prior.</p><p>

<h1>Neopian Pound FAQs</h1>

<h3><a name="pcbasics"></a>Pound Basics Related</h3>


<p><b>▸ What is the Neopian Pound? </b><br>
The <a href="//www.neopets.com/pound/">Neopian Pound</a> is a section of the site where you can adopt, transfer, or abandon a pet.  When you visit the main page of the pound, you'll see an image of three doors for the three functions of the pound. The main page requires Flash, but you can go directly to these links if you can't enable Flash:</p><p> 
<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> The Neopian Pound Links<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/pound/adopt.phtml">Adopt a Pet Link</a><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/pound/transfer.phtml">Transfer a Pet Link</a> (+ <a href="//www.neopets.com/pound/transfer_status.phtml">Transfer Status Link</a>)<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/pound/abandon.phtml">Abandon a Pet Link</a><br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/381_pound.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I adopt a pet? </b><br>
To start, you'll need to find the pet you want to adopt. You can do this by browsing or refreshing the <a href="//www.neopets.com/pound/adopt.phtml">Adopt section</a> of the Pound. When you see a pet you want to adopt, click on it so it appears in a green box, then click the green and white "ADOPT" button and click "Yes" when asked to confirm.</p><p>

If you know the name of the pet you want to adopt, you can type it into the box that says "Search Abandoned Neopets by Name.</p><p>You can also use the link below and replace X with the name of the pet you want to adopt:<br>
//www.neopets.com/pound/adopt.phtml?search=X</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why am I unable to adopt a pet? </b><br>
There are a few reasons you might be unable to adopt a pet:</p><p>
- You've reached the maximum number of pets. Currently, premium accounts are allowed to have 10 pets and non-premium accounts are allowed to have 6.</p><p>
- Your account is too young. New accounts (under 4 months) are subject to some adoption restrictions (jellyneo.net/?go=pound#restrictions); they can only adopt pets up to level 2, of certain colors, and of non-restricted, non-limited species. New accounts won't even be able to see these pets in the pound, so there's little chance of accidentally trying to adopt.</p><p>
- You don't have enough Nepoints (NP) on hand. Pet adoption fees are calculated based on the pet's level, strength, defence, and movement, so a pet with a high level and/or BD stats will be more expensive to adopt than a low-level pet with no stats.</p><p>
- The pet is in "Waiting" status. This is a bizarre glitch in which a pet's petpage will show its owner as "none," but its petlookup will show its status as "Waiting..." If you try to adopt the pet, it will not be available in the pound.</p><p>
- Someone else adopted the pet first.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/165_uni_fly.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I transfer a pet? </b><br>
To start, visit the <a href="//www.neopets.com/pound/transfer.phtml">Transfer section</a> of the Pound. You'll see your pets in a row with the Transfer button under each one. Click the button and fill in the UN of the friend you want to transfer the pet to. If you want to trade your pet for one of your friend's pets, you can do that on the next screen. Transferring a pet will cost you 1,000 Neopoints, and your friend will have to pay an adoption fee of the same amount that they'd have to pay if they adopted the pet from the pound.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why am I unable to transfer a pet? </b><br>
There are a few reasons you might be unable to transfer a pet:</p><p>
- The pet has a no-trade petpet attached, such as a Pile of Soot. You'll get a pop-up reminding you to detach the petpet before trying again.</p><p>
- Your friend's UN was entered incorrectly. Reenter the UN all in lowercase.</p><p>
- You and/or your friend don't have enough NP to complete the transfer. Make sure you have at least 1,000 NP out and your friend has enough out to cover the adoption fee.</p><p>
- You're out of transfers for the month. You only get so many depending on the age of your account; you can check how many here (jellyneo.net/?go=pound#transfer). You won't be able to transfer the pet until your transfers reset on the first day of the next calendar month.</p><p>
- The pet was already transferred once today. You'll get a message saying "X does not want to be User-to-User Transfered right now. Perhaps tomorrow it will be okay." Pets can only be used to initiate a transfer once per day*, according to the Neopets clock.</p><p>
* There is a workaround here; a pet can be transferred multiple times per day as long as another pet is used to initiate the transfer. For example, let's say that Anna sends the pet Sven to Elsa. Elsa wants to send Sven to Kristoff, but she can't initiate the transfer because Sven has already been transferred once.  Kristoff will need to initiate the transfer by offering one of his pets to Elsa in exchange for Sven. (He can adopt a pet from the pound if he doesn't want to give up one of his own pets. Once Kristoff has Sven and Elsa has the pound pet, she can repound it if she doesn't want to keep it.)<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/200_happy_pound.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do I abandon a pet? </b><br>
To abandon or "pound" a pet, visit the <a href="//www.neopets.com/pound/abandon.phtml">Abandon section</a> of the Pound. You'll see your pets in a row with a button under each one. If you have a PIN enabled for this section of the site, enter it in the box. Then click the button under the pet you want to abandon. You will have to click it five times, and each time the text will change to dire pleas and heart-wrenching entreaties such as "Give me up?" or "Leave me to die." You need to callously ignore this begging until you've clicked for the fifth time, when the pet will go into the pound and be available for others to adopt.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why am I unable to abandon a pet? </b><br>
There are a few reasons you might be unable to pound a pet:</p><p>
- The pet has a no-trade petpet attached, such as a Pile of Soot. You'll get a pop-up reminding you to detach the petpet before trying again.</p><p>
- You don't have enough NP to abandon the pet. Take out at least 250 NP before trying again.</p><p>
- You've already abandoned a pet today; the limit for abandoning or pounding a pet is one per day per account. You'll get a pop-up saying "Error: Sorry, you can only leave one Neopet at the pound every day. It is quite full in here already!" You'll need to wait until it's a new day by the Neopets clock to abandon the pet. If you have transfers for the month remaining, you can also transfer the pet to a side account and abandon it from there, assuming you haven't already abandoned a pet from that side account today.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/336_dr_death.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why are there items in my inventory and/or closet after abandoning a pet? </b><br>
When you abandon a pet, the following items will be left in your account:</p><p>
- Any paint brush clothes the pet was wearing, regardless of whether they match its current species/color or not.<br>
- Any NP wearables the pet was wearing.<br>
- Any NC wearables the pet was wearing.<br>
- Any Battledome equipment that was attached to the pet.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is a Glitched Pet? </b><br>
Any pet that is quite literally glitched. These pets are considered rare and sometimes valuable in trading. Many glitched pets will display as an incorrect pet image or a broken image. Some examples include pets that have names with spaces in them (i.e. I am cool the Plushie Draik), Unknown Grundos, and pets with a mismatched color/species (i.e. Lemon Hissi).</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is a Grandfathered Pet? </b><br>
Often at times, this is another name for an unconverted pet. On the PC this may also refer to UC pets with semi-questionable names that have been 'grandfathered' in and allowed to stay on the site. TNT staff determines this on a case by case basis, but has acknowledged that the cutoff date was in 2007.</p><p>- Neopets Editorial - Issue 928 | Question 3 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=928">link</a>] (General Info)<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/symol_elderly.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about the basic of the Pound Chat? </b><br>
The Pound Chat is home to a wide variety of players and the best way to approach this community is by practicing good netiquette. There will be people who have varying opinions on pet names, pet appearances, and so on, but it's best to be kind and respectful through and through.</p>

<p><b>▸ What is a Stuck Pet? </b><br>
A stuck pet is a pet that cannot be found by browsing or refreshing the pound. You need to know the pet's name and search for it in to order to see the pet in the pound and adopt it.</p><p>

Pets get stuck based on the first few letters of their names. For more information on stuck pets and which letters get stuck, see the following petpage:</p><p> 
<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> Mega's Stuck Pet Searching Guide<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Megablade">/~Megablade</a><br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/nt_images/553_kyrii_pound.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Do colored pets in the pound come with clothes? </b><br>
No. When a pet is pounded, its clothes will stay in the owner's closet. This includes paint brush clothes, NP wearables, and NC wearables.</p><p>

If you find an unclothed pet in the pound and want the paint brush clothes for that species and color, you can find someone with the clothes, send them the pet, and ask them to transfer it back to you. Transferring the pet will bring the clothes of the matching paint brush color along with it. To find people with spare clothes available, see the following links:</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ I just saw a pet with clothes in the pound. Why is that? </b><br>
This is usually a visual glitch, and can happen for one of two reasons:</p><p>

- Pets that have been in the pound for years, pre-conversion, will sometimes display with their paint brush clothes on, such as Bruces and Usuls with bows or Elephantes with headdresses. After you adopt the pet and customize it for the first time, it will no longer show up with the clothes on.</p><p>

- There are also a few types of pets that show up as fully customized and the wrong species in the pound.  For example, in the image below, is an example of a Blue Uni that appears as a fully customized Red Acara.  In these cases, the written information on the adopt page is correct and the pet will not have clothes (nor will it be a Red Acara) when adopted:
</p><div class="box"><strong>Blue Uni OR Red Acara???</strong><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aOW5lbW.png"></div>

<br><p><b>▸ What happens when you abandon a Lutari? </b><br>
When you abandon or transfer a Lutari, the Lutari runs off to pound limbo. The pet cannot be readopted nor can the name can be recreated. Only in specific situations, will TNT Support let you readopt your abandoned Lutari.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/keyquest/tokens/roxton_headshot.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I just saw a Magma pet/Ice Bori in the pound, but it turned out to be colored Red/Blue. Why is that? </b><br>
Presumably to maintain the exclusivity of the colors, all Magma pets will turn Red upon being pounded and Ice Boris will turn Blue. (Ice pets of other species will retain the ice color.) If you see a pet in the pound that appears to be Magma or an Ice Bori, it's a visual glitch akin to the pets-with-clothes issues described above. After you adopt the pet and customize it for the first time, it will no longer show up as a Magma pet or an Ice Bori.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/pets/beaten/bori_ice_baby.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to remove a Petpet from a Pound Pet then toss the Pet back into the Pound? </b><br>
While this is distasteful behavior, you are allowed to adopt and repound a pet from the Pound for the sole purpose of taking its Petpet. TNT has stated that the adopted Pet's Petpet is essentially yours to keep and they have no interest in investigating pounded Pets that had their Petpets removed.</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 753 | Question 5 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=753">link</a>]<p>
<strong> I'd like a clarification of something from two weeks ago's editorial. "I recently created a new side account and adopted several neopets out of the pound. One of these neopets had a petpet attached. At first I thought I'd just leave it be, but then I looked the petpet up and found out it was valuable. Can I sell the petpet if I tranfer it to my main first, or is this considered using a side account to cheat? P.S. Please remove my UN. ~ UN removed Hi! You adopted the petpet, it's yours to do what you want with! If you transfer it to your main, you can sell it if you want to." This makes it sound like it's okay to use the pound for financial gain. This text "Note: The Neopian Pound is not to be abused for financial gain. Selling Neopets, or profiting from abandoned Neopets is a freezable offence." is found on the first page of the pound. This makes it sound like adopting a pet to sell it's petpet is not okay but your past editorial makes it sound okay. Please advice. ~ johnnydeppluver1222 </strong></p><p> Hi! So the notice on the Pound page refers to trading Neopets for neopoints (or neopoint items) via the Pound. You can trade Neopet for other Neopets, but not anything else, and doing so is a freezable offense. However, adopting a pet and realizing it has a petpet is a different issue - that's an item we cannot force you to keep (and we have no interest in doing so).</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ What is pound_release? </b><br>
To answer this question, we need to go into a little bit of Neopets history. In 2007, TNT took the pound down for maintenance. People could still pound pets during that time, but the pets could not be adopted. TNT created the pound_release account to hold the pets that had been pounded so they wouldn't all dumped into the pound right away when it reopened.</p><p>

Between 2008 and 2019, pets in pound_release were slowly released into the pound and were able to be adopted. On petpages, the owner was listed as "pound_release." However, TNT changed that in 2019; these pets are no longer being released and the petpage lists the owner as "none." Until TNT fixes this, you will not be able to adopt any pet that is currently in pound_release, and it can be hard to tell if a pet is in pound_release, on breik_u5 (see the next question), or stuck in the pound (see the above question on "What is a Stuck Pet?").</p><p>

For more information about pound_release and the pets that are currently in it, see the following petpage:</p><p> 
<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> pound_release Pet List<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Poundal">/~Poundal</a></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is breik_u5? </b><br>
breik_u5 is an account similar to pound_release. The majority of pets on breik_u5 are Grundos and/or badly named pets. Pets on breik_u5 have never been released, and their petpages also list the owner as "none" now. You will not be able to adopt any pet that is currently on breik_u5.</p><p>

For more information about breik_u5 and the pets that are currently on it, see the following petpage:</p><p>

<p><b>▸ Is my pet rare or worth anything? </b><br>
The short answer: It depends.</p><p>

The long answer: It depends on a lot of things. The "value" of a pet varies wildly depending on its converted/unconverted status, name, Battledome stats, and species and color. In rarer cases, some people who trade or seek pets may also be looking for specific attributes, such as a certain age (year created), a certain birthday/birthdate, or achievements such as trophies. As of October 2020, the following pets tend to be sought on the Pound Chat (PC) board:</p><p>
- Unconverted (UC) pets, particularly rarer species and colors.</p><p>
- Pets with names that are real words (RW), particularly common words in English.</p><p>
- Pets with names that are real names (RN), particularly first/given names with the most common spelling in English.</p><p>
- Pets with names that are 3-4 letters long (3L/4L). These are often expressed as a "CVC," "VCV," etc., where C stands for "consonant" and V stands for "vowel." Thus, a pet named rsr would be a CCC 3L; a pet named Nimo would be a CVCV 4L.</p><p>
- Pets with Battledome stats, which are expressed in HSD (health/hit points + strength + defence).</p><p>
- Pets created in 1999, the first year that the site existed, and occasionally pets created in 2000, the second year.</p><p>

However, it's impossible to give a definitive answer to this question.  You may have the most desirable pet in the world, but it's only "worth" something if you find a person who wants it and they have something you want.  If you have a pet that you'd like to trade, your best bet is to do some research on past trades, ask friends who are experienced traders, or make a board on the PC asking for opinions.

UC pets can wear most backgrounds and some foreground items, but few other NP or NC wearables.</center></td></tr><tr><td><center>Tiers</center></td><td><center>Most UC trading guides separate pets into tiers of some kind, to reflect the fact that some UC pets are numerous and/or common, while others are rare.  The three best-known UC trading guides are:<br><br>- <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Efflie">/~Danpo</a>, which divides pets into 10 tiers<br>
- <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Heat">/~Heat</a>, which divides pets into 11 indexes<br>- <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Za">/~Za</a>, which divides pets into 6 levels.</center></td></tr><tr><td><center>Converted</center></td><td><center> Converted pet. Any pet created after customization was introduced is a converted pet. In addition, not all UC pets were given the option to remain UC (for example, there is no UC Red Kougra), so older pets of certain colors/species now appear as converted pets. Converted pets can wear clothes and other NP and NC wearables.</center></td></tr><tr><td><center>Clothed/Unclothed</center></td><td><center>A pet that has its paint brush clothes is considered "clothed." A pet that does not have its clothes is "unclothed." Most people prefer to spell out these terms so they aren't confused with "UC" for "unconverted.</center></td></tr><tr><td><center>UFT/UFQT</center></td><td><center>Up for Trade/Up for Quick Trade. People who are trading a pet will usually use the term UFT, but may use UFQT to convey that they're looking for a fast trade.</center></td></tr><tr><td><center>UFA/UFQA</center></td><td><center> Up for Adoption/Up for Quick Adoption. Generally, pets that are UFA/UFQA are available to the first person who expresses interest and the current owner does not expect lengthy applications for them, but people may use UFQA to convey that they hope to rehome the pet quickly.</center></td></tr><tr><td><center>Custom</center></td><td><center>When trading a pet, you can offer or inquire about a custom, meaning that the current owner will morph/paint/dip the pet into a certain species or color before trading. For more information, see the question "What does it mean to do Custom on a pet?" below.</center></td></tr><tr><td><center>Y1, Y2, Y3, etc.</center></td><td><center> The year the pet was created. Y1 pets were created in 1999, Y2 pets in 2000, Y3 pets in 2001, and so on.

There is a great deal of latitude given for use of this term, with some misspells being very close to the correct spelling and others being very different.<br><br> Some people prioritize pronunciation in a misspell, meaning that they might consider Cricut a desirable misspell of Cricket, but not Kryckhette.<br><br> Another common misspell is the use of a capital I, lowercase l, or number 1 to create a name that looks visually close to the real one; for example, the name "CaroIyn" includes a capital I instead of a lowercase l, making it appear as "Carolyn" in certain fonts.</center></td></tr><tr><td><center>VWN</center></td><td><center>Very Well Named</center></td></tr><tr><td><center>WN</center></td><td><center>Well Named </center></td></tr><tr><td><center>DN</center></td><td><center>Decent Named/Decent Name</center></td></tr><tr><td><center>BN</center></td><td><center>Badly Named/Bad Name</center></td></tr><tr><td><center>VBN</center></td><td><center>Very Badly Named/Very Bad Name</center></td></tr><tr><td><center>2L, 3L, 4L, etc.</center></td><td><center>The number of letters in the pet's name; for example, Judi would be a 4L.  <br><br>This term can be used for names of any length, but is more commonly seen with shorter names up to ~6L.</center></td></tr><tr><td><center>2C, 3C, 4C, etc.</center></td><td><center> The number of characters, including both letters and numbers, in the pet's name; for example, C3PO would be a 4C.<br><br> This term can be used for names of any length, but is more commonly seen with shorter names up to ~4C</center></td></tr><tr><td><center>CVC, CVCV, etc.</center></td><td><center>The name format, where C stands for "consonant" and V stands for "vowel." <br><br>For example, Judi would be a CVCV.

The capitalization format can vary; both KrazyKarma and Krazykarma would be considered compounds.<br><br> The term is generally applied to words that are not usually used together, such as ElementalDream or Nightsinging; names like Campfire or Pancake would not usually be considered compounds, since they have a long history of being used as one word.<br><br> One or more of these descriptors are often used together, e.g. "I have a VWN 4L Cvcv pet UFT.</center></td></tr></table></center><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> The majority of pet names on the site are neither RWs nor RNs, so these terms were created to refer to the quality of the pet's name based on the format and style (length of name, capitalized vs. uncapitalized, containing numbers and/or underscores).  This is where things start getting mushy, as one person's VWN pet may be WN to another.  These terms should not take personal preference into account; e.g., "I have a bad association with the name Daphne so she is VBN" is not relevant.  Many trading guides, such as <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Danpo">/~Danpo</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Ofu">/~Ofu</a>, specify how many capital/lowercase letters, numbers, and/or underscores are acceptable for each type of name.  In addition, specific games, trading databases, or petpages may have their own standards for what qualifies as a VWN vs. WN pet.</p><p>

Health, on the other hand, is not capped and can be trained infinitely. As a result, traders will refer to the stats of a high-HSD pet as "capped.<br><br> For example, a pet with strength 750, defence 750, and health/hit points 750 equals 2250 HSD. A pet with strength 800, defence 800, and health/hit points 800 equals 2300 capped HSD because the extra 50 strength and defence points are not taken into account.<br><br> This pet could conceivably be advertised as 2400 uncapped HSD, but most people don't bother if they're dealing with a pet with such high stats.</center></td></tr><tr><td><center>Even/uneven</center></td><td><center> When the health, strength, and defence are close in number, a pet is said to be even.<br><br> A pet with strength 120, defence 118, and health/hit points 122 would be considered even.<br><br> A pet with strength 120, defence 8, and health/hit points 165 would be considered uneven.<br><br> Unevenly-statted pets are often a product of using the Lab Ray.

You could train any of the stats for this pet without needing to raise its level. A pet at level 60 with strength 120, defence 8, and health/hit points 165 is not trainable because you would not be able to train defence until you raise its level to 83, which is half of 165.<br><br> Untrainable pets with a low level and high strength and health are often a product of using the Lab Ray. Pets that are trainable are generally considered more desirable. One or more these descriptors are often used together, e.g. "I have a 600 HSD e/t pet UFT. </center></td></tr></table></center><p>

<br><p><b>▸ What does it mean to do Custom on a pet? </b><br>
When a person offers to trade or adopt out a pet with a custom, it means they're offering to make the pet into your desired species and/or color before adopting it out to you. Pets are only allowed to be traded as pet for pet (not items for pet or pet-plus-items for pet), so the custom must be done before they send you the pet. This has nothing to do with customizing, which refers to adding wearables (backgrounds, foregrounds, or clothing) to a pet.</p><p>

Most customs are offered as a value in Neopoints; for example, if someone offers you a "4m custom," that means you could ask for any species/color that can be done for 4 million NP or less. Some people will also offer a Fountain Faerie dip (FFQ), a premium perk, or a Color It Wild/Charity Corner perk as part of a trade, but would specify that since different species/colors are available with each of those special options.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neochat/chat_auctions.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is a UL Custom? Is that even allowed? </b><br>
Yes, sort of. An unlimited custom means that the person offering the custom is willing to spend any amount of NP on changing the pet's species and/or color. Currently the most expensive species/color that can be attained with NP is a Mutant Draik, which runs about 15 million for a Transmogrification Potion.</p><p>

However, certain things <strong>CANNOT</strong> be requested under the umbrella of an unlimited custom, such as:</p><p>
- "Can you open a Faerie Quest Fortune Cookie to get an FFQ and dip the pet into an Alien Aisha?<br>
- "Can you buy premium and use your premium perk to turn the pet into an Ice Bori?<br>
- "Can you buy 100 Armoured Neggs and increase the pet's defence?<br>
- "Can you buy a petpet and/or a petpetpet and attach it to the pet?<br>
- "Can you buy the Stargazing Background and put it on the pet?<br>
- "Can you enter the pet in the Beauty Contest and have it win in its species?<br>
- "Can you feed the pet 700 gourmet foods/read the pet 1500 books and get a trophy?<br>
- "Can you use the pet to get to the end of Neoquest so I can get the avatar?</p><p>

Also, this term has nothing to do with one's userlookup, which is sometimes also referred to as a "UL".</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to purposely trade a Pet with Petpets, Petpetpets (P3s), Wearables, etc. added? </b><br>
As mentioned above, pets are only allowed to be traded as one pet for one pet, and you are not allowed to profit from trading. Petpets, P3s, and wearables cannot be considered as part of the trade. When you're looking at a pet you're interested in, make sure you base your decision on the pet itself (name, converted/unconverted, color/species, stats, etc.).</p><p>

It is generally not suggested to send expensive NP wearables with a pet that is being traded; if the other person removes and sells them, it might look like they're profiting from the trade. Many people do leave petpets and P3s attached (especially since removing the petpet would remove the P3) when trading; however, if they remove an expensive petpet, you should not NM them to ask for the petpet or complain about it not being attached.</p><p>

If you trade for a pet that has wearables, a petpet, and/or P3 attached, it's usually a good idea to ask if the other person wants them back. If they aren't very expensive, most people will say no, and you are free to detach them and put them in your closet/inventory/safety deposit box.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/caption/sm_caption_1313.jpg"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How does one actually break into UC Trading? </b><br>
The short answer: Find someone with a UC that you want and offer them a pet that they want. Trade. Everyone's happy.</p><p>

The long answer: Converted to UC trading is intensely subjective, since people seek and value all sorts of different things in pets. However, if you are trying to break into UC trading, here are some very general suggestions:</p><p>
- Offer a RW/RN pet</p><p>
- Offer a pet with a short, pronounceable name (3-4 letters)</p><p>
- Offer a pet with BD stats, preferably even/trainable.  The higher the HSD the better, and some people prefer pets at level 250+ so they can avoid the long training courses at the Mystery Island Training School.</p><p>
- Offer an NP custom, FFQ, premium perk, or Color It Wild perk on your converted pet.</p><p>
- Offer your pet in shuffles where people with UC pets are accepting converted bids (see the <a href="//www.neopets.com/~hardtotame#pcgames">PC Games Related section</a> below)</p><p>
- Look for people on the PC who are offering UC pets in exchange for very specific converted pets, such as a certain birthday/birthdate, personality attributes, or name.</p><p>
- Any combination of these suggestions is also helpful; for example, a 4L RW pet with BD stats and a custom has a better chance of finding a trade than a 4L pet or BD pet by itself.</p><p>

If you have a BD pet and are hoping to trade it for a UC, see <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Trelm">/~Trelm</a> for a general guide on values or <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Ofu">/~Ofu</a> for past trades.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/362_skeith_pound_escape.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are pet trades through Neomail safe? </b><br>
Yes, as long as the trade is one pet for one pet. Some pet traders prefer to discuss trades via neomail for various reasons (chatting about the details without spamming a board, keeping track of future trades if they are out of transfers this month, etc.).</p>


<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about Pet Trading? </b><br>
If you are ever unsure if something is allowed/disallowed in terms of Pet Trading, then it doesn't hurt to ask the Pound Chat NeoBoard Chat, Help NeoBoard Chat, or Charter NeoBoard Chat (Premium Only). Pet Trading can be pretty complicated at times, so it's understandable if you get lost on the subject.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What happens if I participate in a Pound Chat game, but I don't want to trade my pet? </b><br>
If the game was Free Pass themed, then you are allowed to pass all offers. If it wasn't a Free Pass, then you were obliged to do so. No one can force you to trade your pet, but you shouldn't have listed/bidded a pet, because you are essentially wasting other people's time.</p><p>

If you think you'll have regrets or might feel bad about trading your pet, then please don't list/bid your pet.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ In a Pound Chat game, what happens if my chosen lister/bidder disappears? </b><br>
The host will reach out to the lister/bidder via Neomail to let them know that they received a bid or had their bid accepted, and hopefully, the Neomail will remind them or alert them of the trade. No one can force another player to trade, so at the end of the day, it's up to an honor system. Individual hosts can choose not to allow that person to list/bid in their auctions anymore if they make a habit of disappearing, but oftentimes the reason is innocuous (the lister/bidder fell asleep/had to leave unexpectedly), and the trade is completed at a later time.</p><p>

If your lister/bidder disappeared, you can also choose to accept another offer on your pet.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/231_traveling_library.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to list/bid with a pet from the pound/creatable pet name? </b><br>
You cannot offer an unaltered pet in the pound or a name without some sort of modification (because then anyone could adopt/create the pet), but you absolutely can offer a custom/FFQ/Premium Perk on an undetermined pet (usually the lister/bidder will determine the name/pound pet).</p><p>

Typical listings will include:<br>
- Pound Pet + (NP Amount) Custom<br>
- Untaken Name + FFQ <br>

Or the name of a pet you already own plus those values.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why did the host disallow my bidded/listed pet? </b><br>
It could be for a variety of reasons. Certain PAHs/Shuffles have "types" such as 4L/RW/RN, and your pet may not fall into those categories. Another possibility is the pet name; most PAHs require pets to be V/WN in listing to be considered a "valid" bid.</p><p>

In shuffles, you can typically only list UC pets, and only pets in the "Quiggle pot" (called this because they have a Quiggle emoji added when listing) are accepting converted bids. So, any converted bid on a pet outside of the Quiggle pot would not be considered.</p><p>

In PAHs, it depends on the host, but some only allow converted listings, as UCs tend to draw too much of the bidding pool and can deter others from listing as they will likely receive fewer bids and thus fewer options to choose from in a No Pass where they are expected to trade.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/290_pirate_bori.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are Neomails okay in these Pound Chat games? </b><br>
Typically, the only Neomails that occur are from the host to a lister/bidder if they ghosted (abandoned) a board where a trade is expected to be made. There isn't anything outright forbidding them, but the spirit of the game is to bid/trade/communicate on the board. If you missed the bidding and want to trade for a listed pet after the PAH, Neomailing is fine.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about Pound Chat games? </b><br>
So many things could go here! My two cents:</p><p>
- Don't be afraid to give it a try and to ask questions! Speaking as an avid PAH lister/bidder/host, we're always excited to see new faces, and we want to make it an enjoyable experience where all parties come out happy.<br>
- If you decide to host one, consider a No Pass the first time just so you can get the flow down. Half &amp; Half and No Pass tend to have a lot more listers and thus a lot more to keep track of.<br>
- Don't be a spooky ghost. If you choose to play, commit and make the trades you said you would. Never list if you aren't certain you'll be willing to trade for a VWN basic pet (PAH/Roulette tied).<br>
- Don't be disheartened if your pet doesn't receive bids or get accepted. Trading can be competitive, but the goal of the game is always to have fun and find a trade both parties are happy with, and sometimes that takes time and patience.</p>

<h3><a name="ucpets"></a>Unconverted Pets Related</h3>

<p><b>▸ What is an Unconverted Pet? </b><br>
An unconverted pet is a pet that still has the old, pre-"conversion" art. Conversion happened in 2007 to introduce pet customization and the NC mall. While the majority of pets were automatically converted, there were some color/pet combinations that were not - for example, Coconut JubJub or Plushie Kacheek. If you have one of these pets, it's recommended you don't convert them - they're very prized as they can't be created anymore! Unconverted pets cannot wear clothes other than their paintbrush clothes, but can wear customization items like backgrounds.</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> NOTE: There is currently a bug with Flash conversion, but there are some workarounds similar to those used for Flash Games.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/ctqw747h/1/2.png"><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/2r88vsd3/1/2.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are there any major differences between a converted pet and an unconverted pet? </b><br>
Aside from the artwork and ability to wear bodily wearables, then nope! Unconverted pets can still wear Backgrounds, Foregrounds, etc. but they can't wear Static and Biology Effect zoned clothing.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Will TNT ever bring back UCs? </b><br>
On May 31st, 2021, TNT has announced that they are reintroducing unconverted pets (UCs) through the NC Mall (price, and exact details not mentioned).</p><p> 

On March 13th, 2021, TNT has announced that they are open to the possibility of implementing unconverted pets (UCs) back into the game.

<strike>No, TNT will not bring back unconverted (UC) pets and has officially considered them retired. It is known that TNT do have the power to unconvert pets into their UC formes (only existing post-conversion UCs), but that is usually only done in specific, often direful, situations.</strike>

<br><p><b>▸ I recently found a UC in the pound, what should I do? </b><br>
Congratulations! This is an extremely rare find, but there are a few steps you should take. First, be aware that the pet you found may have been involved in a pound transfer (PT). This is when two users trade their pets through the pound because one party is out of transfers. It's not safe, but it still happens. If someone reaches out to let you know that the pet was the result of a failed PT, it's up to you whether you want to give the pet back to them or not. According to TNT, it's now your pet fair and square.</p><p> However, you should also put in a support ticket with the name of the pet. Unfortunately, there are cheaters on Neopets who hack accounts and steal or pound pets. Putting in a support ticket allows TNT to check if that pet is from a recently compromised account. If it is from a compromised account, and you haven't let them know you found it in the pound/cleared it with them, you run the risk of being unfairly frozen. Other than that, enjoy your new pet! (And as always, if you're new to pet trading - make sure to do it on a public board and ask advice before going through with it, as some people will try to take advantage of new traders. Sad but true!)<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/caption/sm_caption_1081.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a place I can check out all the active UCs pets? </b><br>
You can check them all out in the following page:</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> Jellyneo's Unconverted Pet Preview<br>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about unconverted pets? </b><br>
A lot of people play Neopets because they want to relive their childhood and unconverted pets might be a large factor in that. The converted variants might not have the same nostalgic feeling. Obtaining their desired unconverted pet might seem like a pipe dream, but you'll see some people who successfully achieved their goal against the odds and who cherish their dream pet to this day.</p>

<h1>Trading / Auctions FAQs</h1>
<p><b>▸ Can I trade NP for NC, NC items, Pets, Services, Premium, or any other things than NP items? </b><br>
You are NOT allowed to trade NP for NC, NC items, Pets, Services, Premium, nor other things than NP items.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where do I transfer large sums of NP? </b><br>
Your options would be the Auction House and the Trading Post. You may bid 2 million NP per Trading Post lot. For the Auction House, you can have a 50 million starting price and a 50 million minimum increment.</p>

<h3><a name="nptrading"></a>Selling / Buying Related</h3>

<p><b>▸ How do you sell items and what's the best place to sell them? </b><br>
First off, let's get down to some basics on the places you can sell items at:</p><p>
- <b>Your Shop (Shop Wizard)</b>: Great for items priced 999,999 NP and lower.<br>
- <b>The Trading Post</b>: Great for selling items in bulk and advertising items worth more than the Shop Wizard's NP limit, but has its own limit of 2m per lot.<br>
- <b>The Auction House</b>: It takes an hour at minimum to process a sale, but has a monumental NP limit of a 50,000,000 (50m) NP Starting Price and 50,000,000 (50m) NP Increment. Auctions can be used for a variety of reasons, but not so much in creating quick sales.</p><p>

If the item is under 999,999 NP, then you might want to throw it in your shop.</p><p>

If you're trying to sell things in bulk/sets like Secret Laboratory Map pieces, then hit up the Trading Post.</p><p>

If you've got a bunch of items over 999,999 NPs (Unbuyable or UB), then advertise that entire stash in a Trading Post Lot and/or toss them in the Auction House. If you don't want to deal with all the Neomails from advertising in the Auction House, then advertising only on the Trading Post is fine too.</p><p>

If you want to create a sale for an item above 2,000,000 (2m) NP in pure, then the Auction House would be your go-to. Occasionally, the Trading Post will have people requesting/offering Easy-To-Sell items (ETS) such as Nerkmids, Baby Paint Brushes, etc. as NP filler value if the item is only worth slightly more than 2,000,000 (2m) NP.</p><p>

If you don't want to clutter your Inventory, then making a sales Petpage or Gallery, and advertising that on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=6">Trading / Auctions NeoBoard Chat</a> would be a viable option if you have the energy to maintain it.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/422_aisha_plushie.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How much does X cost? </b><br>
There are three common methods on how to check the price of an item:</p><p>
- Check the item on the Shop Wizard (or Super Shop Wizard or SSW) for the lowest or if there are any available sales listed.<br>
- Check Jellyneo's Item Database as a possible price reference while also checking the currently available Trading Post / Auction House listings. <br>
- Create a Price Check (PC) thread on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=6">Trading / Auctions NeoBoard Chat</a>.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How does one buy an item that's not currently found on the Shop Wizard, Trading Post, or Auction House? </b><br>
You would either want to search for the item on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=6">Trading / Auctions NeoBoard Chat</a> or message possible sellers in Galleries that are looking to make sales.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/137_grarrl_detective.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are item rarities and are they important? </b><br>
All items have a Rarity attached to them they can determine how rare and/or valued an item can be.</p><p>

Items with low rarities tend to be super common (r1-r89), but might be sought out for most Quests of Neopia, the Kadoatery, Faerie Employment Agency, and other miscellaneous activities. Not always but usually, official shops will restock these items in larger batches.</p><p>

Higher rarity items at r90-r100 tend to be extremely rare and highly sought out for Gourmet Club, Jhudora/Illusen Quests, and by collectors. Official shops will only rarely stock these items (especially some of the highest rarity ones e.g. r97~r99), and usually only one will restock at a time.</p><p>

The more extremely priced r100 items are really only obtained from the <a href="//www.neopets.com/desert/extravagance.phtml">Wheel of Extravagance</a> nowadays. There are also a few specific r100 items that are won as special distributions from the Neopian Times and other Creative Contests.</p><p>

r101-r180s vary the most in origin and value, and r500 items are Neocash items.</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is reselling and how does one get into it? </b><br>
Reselling is essentially buying an item for cheap from another Neopian and selling it for a higher price. Some Neopians are willing to discount their wares, because they just want NP now and don't care for the potential profit loss.</p><p>

You can get into reselling by negotiating deals or sending (hopefully) reasonable underoffers to listers on the Trading Post or Auction House (you wouldn't really want to negotiate with Shop Wizard sellers, because of how flexible selling items is there unless you're seeking bulk purchases) or by creating a "Buying X at Reseller Price" thread on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=6">Trading / Auctions NeoBoard Chat</a>.</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> NOTE: You don't want to underoffer on a clearly stable buyable (under 1m) listing, because that's pretty much an insult since the person had made the decision to put it up on the Trading Post/Auction House rather than just shove it in their shop.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/1032.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to artificially inflate an item by buying them all up and reselling them at a higher price? </b><br>
While this is distasteful behavior, it is <i>fine</i> to do if you're the sole inflator. You are <b>NOT</b> allowed to collaborate with others to inflate and manipulate item prices.</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 315 | Question 16 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=315">link</a>]<p>
<strong> Quite often in your Editorials and rules, you have said that it is against the rules for a group of people to get together and purposely inflate items to corner a market. You state that it is okay if only one person does this by themselves, but it seems that nowadays the name of the game is "get with the group and buy up all of an item." How are people being allowed to corner markets like this when it has been stated that group inflation is against the rules? ~kalis_coraven </strong></p><p> If you strongly believe certain players are grouping to inflate items, please, by all means, send in a detailed report about their shenanigans. Such things are very subtle, and we rely on you honest players to give us a heads up when you think your misbehaving Neo-peers are up to no good.</p><p>

Also, to reiterate a past Editorial, yes, one person can buy up all the items they want. However, if they make them unbuyable and suddenly the price jumps from 99k to, say, 600k and start getting offered on expensive items, then it's considered scamming.</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to sell items on my side accounts? </b><br>
You are <b>NOT</b> allowed to sell items on your side account. Guild Account Shops are <i>fine</i> as long as the shop is owned bt the Guild Leader (no account sharing), properly labeled as a Guild Account, and all funds go to Guild purposes.

<h3><a name="restocking"></a>Restocking Related</h3>

<p><b>▸ What is Restocking and how does it work? </b><br>
Restocking is the act of staking out official Neopets shops to hopefully grab some expensive items for cheap to resell them to other users over at shop, the Trading Post, and/or the Auction House.</p><p>

It can be pretty intimidating at first, but once you choose a shop of your liking, learn the profitable (and unprofitable aka "bait") items of the shop, and undergo the experience of buying those items quickly, you'll get a hang of Restocking in no time.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/caption/sm_caption_1324.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How much NP do I need before I start Restocking? </b><br>
That depends on where you want to start restocking, but having 50k-100k certainly helps for most of the common beginner to intermediate-level shops.</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are some good shops to restock at? </b><br>
That varies on your account and own capabilities. <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=73">Kayla's Potionery (73)</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=1">Food Shop (1)</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=7">Magical Book Shop (7), </a><a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=30">Spooky Foods (30)</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=85">Lost Desert Medicine (85)</a>, and the <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=13">Pharmacy (13)</a> are considered to be great beginner shops due to their stocking of profitable items in larger batches. Faerie Quest and Faerie Employment Agency items also tend to be quick-selling small profits.</p><p>

The most profitable, yet most competitive shops include <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=2">Kauvara's Magic Shop (2)</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=58">Neopian Post Office (58)</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=68">Collectable Coins (68)</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=86">Collectable Sea Shells (86)</a>, and <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=8">Collectable Cards (8)</a>. Morphing Potions and collectibles are extremely sought after, and tend to have the most expensive r99 items around.</p><p>

Intermediate-level shops include <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=45">Tyrannian Weaponry (45)</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=3">Toy Shop (3)</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=39">Faerie Foods (39)</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=4">Uni's Clothing (4)</a>, and <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=17">Neopian Gift Shop (17)</a>.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is a Restock Ban? </b><br>
A Restock Ban is when all the official shops decide that you've had enough of restocking for a specific amount time, during which you won't be able to see any items in any official shop. They're completely normal/generally random and they can last for up to 24 hours if you're really unlucky.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/desert/14_grarrl.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How many shops should I restock at a time? </b><br>
That's a personal choice. The more shops you restock at a time, the higher the chance you have at being restock banned, but refreshing only one shop can be pretty boring for some people.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why did all the items in the offical shops just suddenly disappear? </b><br>
That's what we call a Clear. Shops automatically "clear" out items at random intervals, so that new items can restock!</p><p>

If you think there's a clear or you're shop banned, you can do the following:<br>
A. Check other shops you wouldn't normally visit for an SWI (Shop With Items).<br>
B. If you had a shop tab open with stock before the clear, then try to buy an item. If it sends you to the haggle screen rather than a sold out screen, then you're restock banned.<br>
C. Ask other RSers for an SWI to verify if you're restock banned or not.<br>
D. Check on a side account for an SWI (DO <b>NOT</b> RESTOCK ON SIDE ACCOUNTS)<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/307_poogle_shop.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why is there nothing good appearing? How long does it take for X appear? </b><br>
Restocks and clears are all random.</p><p>

Restocking is all about having patience for shops to restock, being quick enough to make the haggle, and then having the patience again to sell. It can take minutes to hours for shops to restock/clear and it's completely up to chance if specific items appear at all (the higher the rarity index, the rarer the item). Most of the time shops will stock nothing but junk but that won't stop us from trying.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to Restock on side accounts? </b><br>
You are <b>NOT</b> allowed to restock on side accounts. Even if you get restock banned on your main account, you are not allowed to go onto a side account to continue restocking.</p><p>- Neopets Editorial - Issue 221 | Question 2 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=221">link</a>] (Restocking on sides is <strong>NOT</strong> allowed)</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to block certain junk items/item images from appearing on my screen in order to make it easier to see profitable items? </b><br>
You are <b>NOT</b> allowed to block items/item images from appearing on your screen, whether through third-party tools or not. That is considered cheating and a freezable offense.</p><p>- Neopets Editorial - Issue 275 | Question 10 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=275">link</a>] (blocking images for restocking is <b>NOT</b> allowed)<br>

<br><p><b>▸ Does "Neopian Inflation is currently at X.XX%" mean anything? </b><br>
It factors into the estimated cost a shop stocks at an item at, but since that never changes it doesn't matter anymore. It's really just flavour text nowadays.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/myportfolio.gif"></p>

<p><b>▸ What is the Shop Wizard? </b><br>
The <a href="//www.neopets.com/market.phtml?type=wizard">Shop Wizard</a> is a place where Neopians can look up items from Neopian usershops. Searching for items is free of charge, but be aware of its limitations and mechanics.</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why does the Shop Wizard always show me the same people? </b><br>
The Shop Wizard randomly searches through many groups of shops depending on the first letter of the user's UN, so you might have to resubmit the search request in order to get a different selection of usershops.</p><p>

The following grouped UNs by the first letter of UN are:</p><p>
A, N, 0 (zero)<br>
B, O, 1<br>

A Shop Wizard ban is when you hit the limit of 360 searches within the current hour. The search counter resets at the top of the next hour.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/746b9753/3ceb2e2.png"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a way to search for a specific item that shares the same name as other items (like Treasure Maps)? </b><br>
Unfortunately, if an item shares the same exact name with another item, you cannot specify which of the multiple variants to search for. The Shop Wizard will select one at random.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I clicked on a Frozen Shop. Why doesn't TNT remove these? </b><br>
TNT does take notice of Frozen Shops awhile after they've been spotted and will usually remove them within a week or so.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How often should I reprice my usershop? </b><br>
That is up to you to decide, but updating your shop prices every week or so doesn't hurt. You might have some competition when lowering your prices, but you also need patience when selling your items even if you have the lowest price on the Shop Wizard.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/t_1195.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are Neopets Malls still a thing? </b><br>
Despite the Neopian Marketplace being broken, Neopets Malls are indeed still a thing! Neopets Malls are usually run by Guilds and/or Neopians on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=11">Shop Ads NeoBoard Chat</a>.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/shopkeepers/marketplace_newimage.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about the Shop Wizard? </b><br>
When pricing your shop, you would want to avoid leaving your price boxes blank or entering special characters (zeroes are fine). This because there is a bug that can shift the prices of your items to the item next to it. In the event this occurs, you should consider immediately select the Remove All box in the bottom of the page to prevent your items from potentially being sold at the wrong prices.</p>

<p><b>▸ What is the Trading Post? </b><br>
The <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/tradingpost.phtml?type=view">Trading Post</a> is a place where Neopians can trade their items and NP with other Neopians. There is no fee for listing items nor placing offers.

<br><p><b>▸ Why can't I post a description in my Trading Post lot? </b><br>
If you are unable to create a description in your Trading Post lot, then the reason could mean one of the following:<br>
- You're under 13.<br>
- Your account was silenced.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/msn_buddy/msn_school_pencilwrite.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a limit of how many Neopoints I can put in a Trading Post lot? </b><br>
The Trading Post limit is 2,000,000 (2m) NP per offer.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a limit of how many Trading Post lots I can accept/be accepted for? </b><br>
Nerkmids (~75k) and Baby Paint Brushes (600k) are often used as item currency to get around the NP limit. You can also ask the lister to place the item in a one-bid Auction (NF Auction is the safest).</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a limit on how many individual Trading Post lots I can accept an offer on/have my offers accepted on? </b><br>
There are no limits, but note that you can only accept one offer per individual lot.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/347_trading_post.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is a Split Trade and are they allowed? </b><br>
Split Trades are when a lister requests the bidder to place two offers: one on their main listing and another on a junk item listing in order to effectively bypass the 2m NP limit on a singular lot. They are discouraged due to the high possibility of being scammed, but they also fine if you are trading with a person you trust.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I traded with someone else but somehow, one of us did not get their end of the trade. What can we do? </b><br>
If for some reason the Trading Posts bugs out and does not provide one side with their end of the trade, then send in a support ticket to TNT at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/help.phtml">official FAQ</a>. Make sure to grab the Lot and Offer Number, and mention both recipients of the trade.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a way I can search for a specific item with the same name of another item? </b><br>
Unfortunately, if an item shares the same exact name with another item, you cannot specify which of the multiple variants to search for.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I see some listers with a bunch of the same high-end themed items. Are they doing something malicious? </b><br>
Probably not, they are most likely a reseller (Paint Brushes, Secret Lab Maps, random r101-180s) and/or avid restocker (r95-r99 Stamps, Morphing Potions, Gourmets, Collectible Cards, etc.).<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/snow_mag_pea.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_grarrl_spikyclub.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/pot_hissi_ice.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/labmap_01.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/sta_bd_slices.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/pb_stealthy.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about the Trading Post? </b><br>
Trading Post lots have an expiration date of two weeks, so it doesn't hurt to manually take them down and repost them every once in awhile to refresh the timer, if your items have been there for long.</p><p>

It is fairly common for Neopians to forget about their lots and have them expire since you are not sent any notifications when it happens. Items from expired lots are placed back in your Inventory like any other item, where they are vulnerable to various Random Event-related mishaps.</p>

<h3><a name="auctions"></a>Auction House Related</h3>

<p><b>▸ What is the Auction House? </b><br>
The <a href="//www.neopets.com/auctions.phtml">Auction House</a> is a place where Neopians can sell items by listing them for a specified amount of time and buy items by openly competing with other Neopians. Auctioned items are usually listed below their usual Trading Post prices and increment with every bid. Placing items up for auction is free of charge.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/nt_images/502_auctionhouse_scorchio.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a limit on how many Auctioned Items I can have? </b><br>
You can only have 8 auctioned items at a time.</p><p> 
<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/pteri.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> Auction House Articles<br>
jellyneo.net/?go=auctions<br>
thedailyneopets.com/articles/auctions<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/terms.phtml"> Auction-Related Help</a></p> 

<br><p><b>▸ What's the NP limit for the Auction House? </b><br>
The maximum starting price is 50,000,000 (50m) NP and the maximum minimum increment is also 50,000,000 (50m) NP.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How long does it take for an Auction House listing to go through? </b><br>
It should only take a few minutes for the listing to process, but rarely, the Auction House will become "stuck" in processing and items and NP may be held in limbo for hours or even days. TNT will eventually take notice and fix the issue, so your items and NP will ultimately go through safely, but it can be an annoying wait whenever this happens.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ I got outbid, but do I get my Neopoints back? </b><br>
In the event you lose the Auction, your Neopoints will be returned once the listing is closed and processed.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/redeem_prize.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a way I can cancel my offer in the Auction House? </b><br>
Auction offers are finalized once the bid has been placed. You are not entitled to a refund unless it was a blatant scam (Paint Brush Plushies for their Non-Plushie prices), in which case it is a reportable offense and you should notify TNT as soon as possible.</p><p>- Neopets Editorial - Issue 306 | Question 3 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=306">link</a>] (General Info)</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I allowed to do Auctions with my side accounts? </b><br>
You are <b>NOT</b> allowed to create Auction lots on your side accounts for the sole purpose of creating sales or to manipulate the prices of items. Transferring NP on the other hand is fine, but the Trading Post is preferred over the Auction House for that.</p><p>- Neopets Editorial - Issue 907 | Question 4 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=907">link</a>] (Profiting on sides is <strong>NOT</strong> allowed)<br>
- Neopets Editorial - Issue 338 | Question 9 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=338">link</a>] (Bidding on sides to inflate prices is <strong>NOT</strong> allowed)<br>
- Neopets Editorial - Issue 282 | Question 2 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=282">link</a>] (Bidding on sides to inflate prices is <strong>NOT</strong> allowed)</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there some sort indicator to know when an Auction ends exactly? </b><br>
Nope, you'll have to rely on yourself (or the lister if it was posted on the NeoBoards, Guilds, etc.) to know the exact time on when an auction ends. You could stalk the main Auction House page as it shows the approximate ending time for auctions that are due to end soon, but the processing time isn't always consistent.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/caption/sm_caption_1282.jpg"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I accidentally mispriced my Auctioned item. Am I allowed to ask for help to bump it up and get the person to return it back to me? </b><br>
You are allowed to ask the NeoBoards to see if there might be people generous to help you out although do know that the winner is not obliged to return the item to you nor at the price they won the item at.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What's a Fun Auction? </b><br>
A Fun Auction is when a Neopian creates a listing of an expensive item at an extremely low price (i.e. 1 NP Starting Bid &amp; 1 NP Increment Nerkmid, Paint Brushes, etc.). The Neopian is not expecting to make a profit, because they want to have a fun competition on who can who outbid the other person.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are Dr. Sloth Auctions? </b><br>
Dr. Sloth Auctions were an old method of reintroducing rare and retired items back to the site. TNT would create a fake staff account based off a popular Neopian character (i.e. Dr_Sloth) and auction rare items such as Wock Til You Drop Stamp, Coltzan Stamp, etc.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/nt_images/627_sloth_slymook.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about the Auction House? </b><br>
If you're unsure about or don't remember how to put up an Auction listing, it doesn't hurt to put up a junk item to test run your actual item in question. Also, you can use commas when creating your Auction House listing, if you're afraid that you'll miss out a zero. Note that the first bid on your auction is the <b>Starting Price + Minimum Increment</b>, so if your Starting Price is set at 100,000 NP and your Minimum Increment is 50,000 NP, the first bid is required to be at least 150,000 NP.</p>

<h3><a name="fea"></a>Faerieland Employment Agency Related</h3>

<p><b>▸ What is the Faerieland Employment Agency? </b><br>
The <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/employ/employment.phtml">Faerieland Employment Agency</a> (or FEA) is a place where you are able to complete jobs in exchange for Neopoints, and is located on the left fringe of Faerie City in Faerieland.<br></p><p> 
<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/jellykacheek.gif"> JN's Faerieland Employment Agency Article<br>jellyneo.net/?go=employment<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/frontpage/new_agency_2007.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is a Faerieland Employment Agency job? </b><br>
There are listings in the Faerieland Employment Agency that you can apply for asking you to find between 2 to 6 of a certain r2-r69 item within a specified time and given a Neopoints reward.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why apply for a Faerieland Employment Agency job? </b><br>
Some reasons include making Neopoints, beating others in getting the good jobs or personal satisfaction seeing the job counter increase on your pet's lookup. There is also a rankings leaderboard for the top 100 pets to recognise those who have put in the most effort.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/101_moehog_stocks.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Can you lose Neopoints from Faerieland Employment Agency jobs? </b><br>
Not all jobs are profitable. There will be instances where the items will cost more than you will gain from the job reward. It is therefore beneficial to have an estimate of how much the items will cost and what the payout will be before you apply if you want to make Neopoints. However, you can always decline the job for a penalty of 200 NP within the allotted time if you do not want to finish the job and want to avoid it being counted as a failure on your pet's lookup.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How can you apply for a Faerieland Employment Agency job? </b><br>
There are 2 types of listings: basic jobs which do not require a job coupon and super jobs which will ask for a minimum coupon type. Each time you get accepted for a super job, your job coupon will get downgraded to a lower level. You can go through the listings of both types at the top of the page. The newer listing will appear at the end and oldest ones at the front. The best jobs will appear near the back as they will only be up for a short time before being taken by someone. There is no set time (similar to restocking) for when new listing will appear so you will need to refresh periodically to find the best jobs. Once you find one to your liking, then click on the "Apply for this Job" link.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/fbo_faerieday_4.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How do you complete a Faerieland Employment Agency job? </b><br>
Once you apply for a job, there will be a confirmation whether you have gotten it or if it has been taken up by someone else. If you get the job then you can search for your items yourself using either the Shop Wizard or Super Shop Wizard, unlike faerie quests. The confirmation page will have a link for you to turn your items in so you should try to buy your items in a different tab or window for convenience. You can also return your items through visiting the status page and clicking on your current job if you don't have the page open.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ How many Faerieland Employment Agency jobs can you do a day? </b><br>
5 jobs. You can get locked out before this by being told to come back tomorrow if you do them in quick succession or after completing your 4th of the day. This can last for up to 10 minutes, but you will eventually be able to apply again until you have completed 5 in total for that day.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/147_scorchio_job.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How much can you earn from Faerieland Employment Agency jobs? </b><br>
How much you will earn is dependent on the base reward and how fast you complete the job in relation to the allotted time. As long as you complete the job in time then you will get the base reward amount as a minimum. There is an additional 25% bonus of the base reward on top if you complete the job within a quarter of the time. The extra amount given is dependent on the time taken. For example, if you take 0 seconds (by getting all the items before being accepted for the job) then you will always get the full bonus (1.25x of the base reward) whereas taking exactly 1/4 of the time will net you just the base reward. This is on a sliding scale so it is better to complete the job as quickly as possible to get a higher bonus even if you have a lot of time.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/template_images/grarrl_count_fingers.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are the base payouts for Faerieland Employment Agency jobs? </b><br>
Basic Jobs: less than 10k NP</p><p>

Super Jobs<br>
Green Job: 3-3.5k NP (lowest ranked job)<br>
Blue Job: 4.5-5k NP<br>
Red Job: 9-10k NP<br>
Silver Job: 28-30k NP<br>
Gold Job: 50-60k NP<br>
Purple Job: 75-80k NP<br>
Pink Job: 99-100k NP<br>
Green Brightvale Job: 20-25k NP<br>
Bronze Brightvale Job: 40-45k NP<br>
Silver Brightvale Job: 60-70k NP<br>
Gold Brightvale Job: 80-100k NP (highest ranked job)</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> NOTE: Higher-leveled job coupons can be used to apply for lower-leveled jobs, and there is a cap of 100,000 NP (after bonus) per job.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are job coupons worth it? </b><br>
Not if you are doing the 3 lowest job tiers as the base payouts of those overlap with basic jobs, so you can receive similar rewards without using a coupon at all. As for the rest, the prices of job coupons fluctuate back and forth so you will need to decide whether the Neopoints gained is greater than the cost of the job coupon being downgraded one level. You do not have to apply for the same job type as your job coupon so you need to take into consideration if you can get a higher return with a lower ranked job. Be sure when using them because your job coupon will still be downgraded if you decline or do not finish the job.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bvb_couponguide.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where does one obtain Job Coupons? </b><br>
Job Coupons can be obtained from the following:<br>
- Wheel of Knowledge (Brighvale Coupons only)<br>
- Wheel of Extravagance (All)<br>
- Shop Wizard / Trading Post / Auction House (All)</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Where are all the Pink jobs? </b><br>
Pink jobs are extremely rare. Most people with Pink Job Coupons would sell them directly.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/pink_ticket.gif"></p>

A broad listing of Neopets Merchandise can be found <a href="//www.neopets.com/shopping/catalogue/">here</a>, but not all of those will provide a code.</p><p> 

For other products that can reward the Space Faerie challenger are: old Neocash Mystery Capsules Codes, Fun Pak Codes, Comic-Con Codes, What's Your Passion Jewelry codes, Geekify Inc. codes (not all of their merchandise have codes), Overpowered Codes, etc. 

</p><p>TCG Codes, Neocash Codes, and Promotional Rare Item Codes <i>do not</i> reward the Space Faerie challenger.

</p><p>You could try the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=21">Avatars/NeoSignatures NeoBoard</a> to ask other Neopians for a Space Faerie Code for free. Some people do genuinely give out codes on the Neoboards to other users who can't purchase one for themselves (usually because the merchandise isn't sold in their country). However, these people won't ask you to pay them for the code, mainly because asking for such payment is against Neopets' rules. Although, it is courtesy to send the rewarded items to the gifter.

<br><p><b>▸ Where do I redeem Virtual Prize Codes? </b><br>
If you are redeeming TCG Codes, then you would visit <a href="//www.neopets.com/tcg/tcg_redeem.phtml">Neopets TCG Prize Code Redemption</a>.<br>
If you are redeeming Neocash Codes, then you would visit the <a href="http://nc.neopets.com/redeemnc">Redeem NC Page</a>.<br>

<br><p><b>▸ Are Neocash Cards and Rare Item Codes considered Merchandise?</b><br>
Short answer, yes. Official real-world Neopets products, such as Neocash Cards and Rare Item Codes, are fine to be resold. Here's TNT's response:<br></p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 610 | Question 3 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=610">link</a>]<p> <strong> Hi, TNT! I have an odd question for you.... about commissions. Now, I know taking them in exchange for anything on Neopets is against the rules, as is doing commissions with Neopets characters. However... what about real-life merchandise? I'm the sort that's willing to take trades, and I was wondering: could someone pay me in Neopets plushies? What about rare item codes, or Neocash? (the cards, not actual on-site NC items) I mean, people sell the item codes on ebay all the time, so wouldn't that be okay? As far as NC cards go, if I'm just going to buy them anyway, why not save a step? Would these be against the Terms &amp; Conditions because they give things on the site itself? I mean, obviously, it still wouldn't be okay to do a commission OF Neopets, but in exchange for merchandise, where do you guys stand? (please remove my UN) ~UN removed </strong></p><p> As you said, as long as you aren't taking commissions of Neopets intellectual property, you're welcome to trade or sell your real-world merchandise however you'd like. According to Lawyerbot: "Trading plushies, rare item codes, NC cards, etc. for real life merchandise is fine. I once traded my brother's turtle to a friend for a Shadow Uni Plushie".</p></div>

<h3><a name="overpowered"></a>Overpowered Related</h3>

<p><b>▸ So what is Overpowered and what happened to them?</b><br>
On April 19th, 2018, Overpowered was a revival of Neopets merchandise for a short period of time. They sold keychains which provided Space Faerie Codes and onsite rewards such as toys, wearables, and other fun goodies. Although some can say that the company was painted with Scritchy Sketchy Paint Brush.</p><p>

- Pre-orders were delayed or for the most part, never delivered.<br>
- An E-Mail was sent with them begging users to purchase more pre-orders with the promise of new merchandise.<br>
- After a year, Overpowered had gone out of business. Their website has been decommissioned, and the domain name was sold to a third party that is now displaying not family-friendly content. We highly recommend not seeking out the current website. </p><p>

On <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2019-11-11">November 13th, 2019</a>, TNT had announced to split from Overpowered:

</p><div class="box"><p>We have an announcement to make. We'd like to let everyone know that we are no longer affiliated with Overpowered. We are genuinely sorry many of you did not receive your items and are doing our best to compensate you.

<br><p><b>▸ I'm late, but can I still get compensated for not getting my Overpowered merch? </b><br>
From July 30th, 2019 to August 20th, 2019, TNT provided onsite compensation for the unfulfilled Overpowered merchandise orders through their social media. While they have closed this sort of support submissions through their social medias, it would probably be best to submit a ticket through the <a href="//www.neopets.com/help.phtml">official FAQ</a> if you still wish to be compensated. Do keep in mind to have the necessary information while requesting support.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Will TNT ever rerelease Overpowered on-site item prizes? </b><br>
Fortunately, TNT has rereleased some of the Overpowered on-site item prizes through their 20th Anniversary Merchandise Test! It is a rare occasion where TNT rereleases Rare Item Code prizes.</p>

<p><b>▸ Why isn't anything loading? It's not lag, but I just cannot see the maps nor play the games? IS THIS THE FLASH DYING I HAVE HEARD SO MUCH OF???</b><br>
You most likely will need to <b>Allow Flash</b> if you still have Adobe Flash and a browser that allows it. This can be done by clicking the "i" next to your address bar and changing the settings to "Allow." If that doesn't work, try clearing your cache and cookies.</p><p>

As for the future of Flash Support, TNT has announced that <b>they are working it</b> and you can see their progress over at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/releasenotes/">Release Notes</a>.

</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 861 | Question 1 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=861">link</a>]<p> Special serious announcement from Scrappidoodledandy!</p><p>

Hey Neopians!</p><p>

Scrappy here to give you a little update on what's going on here in Neopia. There's a lot of rumors and speculations going around, so I want to be very upfront with you guys on what our plans are at the moment for moving our lovely home to mobile.</p><p>

As we are all aware, all this flash has got to go. The largest part of that being the customization that allows us to make our Neopets look all spiffy. We're currently working on moving all the art over and are hoping to get a beta version out to you guys early this summer. Once that is up and running you will be able to customize your lovely pets on any browser at any time!</p><p>

Another topic of discussion here is all our games. The plan right now is to move these over in batches, starting with about 10 games and moving more from there. We want to be able to bring over all of them with time but starting small will be quicker and let us take your guys feedback moving forward!</p><p>

Of course, there have been other parts moving as I'm sure you all have noticed, such as the maps and other events using flash. We are hoping to get all these converted as soon as we can, focusing around the maps first and foremost then moving onto the other pieces from there.</p><p>

I am also aware there have been many mentions of an app and while that is not out of the picture, we have decided to focus on moving away from flash and make that our top priority first. Along with moving away from flash, we are making a mobile-friendly browser version to improve the user experience when on a mobile device. This is another area we will want to release test versions as soon as we can and get all your feedback to improve moving forward.</p><p>

Those are most of the updates for right now! I wanted to be very upfront with you guys here because since this is all to improve your experience, we want to make sure we can get your feedback and let that guide us each step of the way! I will be setting up a time soon to jump on the boards, so we can have a more open discussion about this as well but wanted to start with an update here!</p><p>

As always, stay cool Neopians!</p><p>

<br><p><b>▸ The textbox to reply to a NeoMail has vanished! What do I do? </b><br>
You would want to refresh the page until the textbox comes back. If that does not work, then you can switch to Plain Text Neomail over at your <a href="//www.neopets.com/preferences.phtml">Preferences</a> to prevent the issue from happening frequently.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/boo_chainmail_craft.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ How can I get TNT's attention on _____? </b><br>
If it's a content suggestion, request, or inquiry, then I'd check out the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editform">Editorial</a> or <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=13">Ideas / Suggestions NeoBoards Chat</a>.</p><p>

If it's a Beauty Contest or Art Gallery related inquiry, then I would first check out if there's a TNT thread in <a href="/">Art NeoBoard Chat</a>, then the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editform">Editorial</a>.</p><p>

If it's about a type of abuse, then I would send an <a href="//www.neopets.com/autoform_abuse.phtml?abuse=report">Abuse Report</a>.</p><p>

For all and all else, submit a ticket through the <a href="//www.neopets.com/help.phtml">official FAQ</a> and also post your ticket number on the Highway to Help thread in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=5">Help NeoBoard Chat</a>.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why does my account say I was last active _____? I never leave the site.</b><br>
Log out and log back in to fix this issue.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/msn_buddy/msn_gelert_waving.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why am I always logged out of the NC Mall when I'm logged in everywhere else?</b><br>
Log out and then log in through the NC Mall to fix this issue.</p>

<h3><a name="safety"></a>Account Safety</h3>

<p><b>▸ Do I really need a PIN? </b><br>
Pins are absolutely necessary. You don't need to put a pin on everything. They are not only used for account safety, but pins can play a key role as vital information for account retrieval if you happen to need to access your account through ticket support.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/pin/bank_pin_mgr.gif"></p> 

<br><p><b>▸ How often should I change my password/pin? </b><br>
You should change your password/pin every 4-6 months or so.</p><p>

<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/rednose.gif"> NOTE: If you haven't changed your password/pin prior 2016, I would advise you would immediately do so.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What are the elements of a strong/weak password? </b><br>
The characteristics of a STRONG password include:<br>
- Having over 14 characters<br>
- Having uppercase and lowercase letters<br>
- Having numbers<br>
- Having special characters (!, #, $, %, etc. though do not use less/greater than signs, as that can be problematic)<br></p><p>The characteristics of a WEAK password include:<br>
- Using common personal identifiable information (Name, BDay, etc.)<br>
- Short passwords<br>
- Keyboard series and repeats (qwerty, 12345, aaaaa, etc.)<br>
- Using common and lazy phrases like the word "password".<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_grarrlhead_shield.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is sharing accounts and/or passwords really that bad or against the rules? </b><br>
YES, IT IS <strong>BAD</strong>. This is not only a danger to your account, but it is also a freezable offense.</p><p> 
<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> Neopets Terms of Use<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/terms.phtml"> 10. Do Not Share Your Account</a></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I just saw someone link off-site. Is it safe to follow the link? </b><br>
Aside from offical fan-sites (which are okay), do <strong>NOT</strong> go to those unofficial sites. Linking (or even partly mentioning) off-site links is a warnable/freezable offense, and you would want to protect yourself from phishing attacks.</p><p> 
<img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif"> Community - Fan-Site Directory<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/fansites/index.phtml"> Fan-Site Directory Link</a></p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is this images50 pop-up and why is asking for my information? </b><br>
That is Neopets's back image server and do <strong>NOT</strong> enter your information in it. There have been reports of people's accounts getting frozen for doing so.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ Are there any dangers of using a public or different computer/Wi-Fi location to play Neopets? </b><br>
It should be safe to play Neopets at a different computer/Wi-Fi location. Just remember to log out afterwards if it is a public device.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/frontpage/ss_left.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Am I in any danger if my family also plays Neopets with the same computer/Wi-Fi location? </b><br>
You should be fine. TNT can tell and understand that families play Neopets too.</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 908 | Question 2 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=908">link</a>]<p>
<strong>Hi TNT!! My younger sister plays Neopets and enjoys your site! I recently moved in with her and was wondering if I'm still able to play my games and dailies when using her laptop? I wasn't sure what your rules are for this. ~~kristytempy</strong></p><p> Of course you can both continue playing! We know a lot of our members do share an IP or even a computer with family members who also play. Just continue to play the same way you always have. :)</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ Someone just randomly gifted me some items / wanted to adopt me a really cool pet. Do I take it?</b><br>
You do <strong>NOT</strong> want to accept random gifts from shady/shell-looking accounts. If the goods happen to be from an illegitimate source, you might be frozen for being complicit in rulebreaking. If it's too good to be true, then it probably is risky. </p>

<br><p><b>▸ Someone just told me to check out their userlookup/petlookup/petpage, but their account looks pretty empty. Am I in any danger? </b><br>
In most cases, probably not, but you do <strong>NOT</strong> want to visit user/pet lookups or petpages from shady/shell-looking accounts. When in doubt, you can always just log out and clear your cookies to prevent hidden malicious activity.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/new_tradingcards/md_5.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Do you have any other tips about keeping my account secure? </b><br>
There are topics that we cannot discuss in this petpage due to filters, but I would read over the following guides for more information on protecting your account:</p><p>

<h3><a name="prevent"></a>Bot Prevention Related</h3>

<p><b>▸ What are all these CAPTCHAs I'm seeing on Userlookups and Pet Userlookups?</b><br>
CAPTCHAs are a security feature and bot prevention system. You have to complete a CAPTCHA every time you want to view a Userlookup or Pet Userlookup, and they will also appear in various Altador Cup games.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/caption/sm_caption_1320.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there a way to bypass Userlookup and Pet Userlookup CAPTCHAs?</b><br>
No, and that would defeat the purpose of having CAPTCHAs in the first place.</p>

<br><p><b>▸ What is this StackPath? </b><br>
StackPath is another security feature and bot prevention system that was implemented to prevent malicious activity on the site. However, it will inadvertently block casual players from their usual activities from time to time. Thankfully, this is not as frequent as you'd think (probably a few days every month or so).<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/betterthanyou/contestant245.gif"></p>

<br><p><b>▸ I got hit by StackPath out of nowhere and it won't allow me to return to the site. What can I do to fix this? </b><br>
You would want to clear your cookies on the site. Don't be alarmed if you happen to be logged out afterwards, but if this doesn't work, then I would suggest sending a ticket to the <a href="//www.neopets.com/help.phtml">official FAQ</a> for support. </p>

<br><p><b>▸ Why doesn't Neopets have a 2FA in this day and age? </b><br>
TNT is planning to add additional account security measures in the near future (such as 2FA).</p><div class="box">Neopets Editorial - Issue 873 | Question 1 [<a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=873">link</a>]<p>
<strong> Are you guys still working on 2-factor authentication? We're all desperate for it! ~~welikedots </strong></p><p> The first step is to switch over to HTTPS. We're working on that. 2-factor authentication is something we'd like to take up after that, so no, we aren't working on it at the moment.</p></div>

<br><p><b>▸ Is there anything else I need to know about Bot Prevention? </b><br>
As annoying CAPTCHAs and StackPath can be, it's important to have patience with these things. Neopets has implemented them for the protection of its members, and in the future we'll have 2-factor authentication to strengthen our account security.<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/clicktoplay/screenshot_thumbnail_507_2_v1.png"></p>
