<hr><br><br><font size="6" face="mistral">Year 16</font><br><br><font color="red"><b>Policy Decisions</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="red">●</font> After several successful years as part of Viacom, Neopets.com found a new parent company this spring. <b>JumpStart</b> create and manage all kinds of video games, but are probably most famous for their range of educational games for younger players. Don't worry, though -- most of the staff we know and love are sticking around, and we're pretty sure the next plot won't be Roxton Colchester Teaches Typing. The move to the new server location took place in the autumn of this year. While everyone's data made it across okay, at the time of writing TNT are still ironing out a lot of persistent bugs. Hang in there!
<br><br><font color="red">●</font> Sadly, a couple of well-loved Flash-based activities were retired this year. <b>Petpet Park</b> and <b>Professor Milton Clodbottle's Astounding Habitarium</b> have both been taken out of service. If you participated in Habitarium, Professor Clodbottle has a little gift for you that you can collect by going <a href="//www.neopets.com/habitarium/">here</a>.
<br><br><font color="red">●</font> Popular Neopets Team member <b>Snarkie</b> stepped down from her position at HQ this year to move onto other projects. We're sad to see such an awesome staffer leave, but I'm sure you'll agree that we wish her the absolute best.
<br><br><font color="red">●</font> The maximum you can bid at the Trading Post is now <b>2,000,000</b> Neopoints, up from 800,000, and the maximum auction increment and starting price are now both <b>50,000,000</b> Neopoints.
<br><br><font color="red">●</font> If you're planning to create a Ruki, you may have to wait -- or find a morphing potion. This long-legged desert bug has joined the list of Neopia's <b>Limited Edition</b> species.

</p>

<font color="blue"><b>Revamps</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="blue">●</font> This was the year <b>Something has Happened!</b> events suddenly stopped... happening. With the help of a Lutari scientist named Dr Landelbrot, however, Neopia's Random Events were soon brought back better and shinier than before. Of note, that mischievous baby Bruce <b>Boochi</b> seems to have stopped changing Neopets into babies for the time being. Whether this is a relief or a disappointment is a matter of opinion.
<br><br><font color="blue">●</font> All items that a Neopet can wear now have a <b>coathanger</b> icon in the corner, so you can easily pick them out when shopping.
<br><br><font color="blue">●</font> <b>Mystery Capsules</b> now work slightly differently, thanks to changes made this summer. You are now <i>guaranteed</i> to receive an item that matches the theme of the capsule you bought, whether that's heroes, villains, Meepits, or whatever else TNT decide to theme a capsule around next. No more random hair bows and pairs of glasses!
<br><br><font color="blue">●</font> The method used to restock <b>main shops</b> was changed this autumn, with the promise that shops will not hold onto old stock for as long as they used to. Happy shopping.
</p>



<font color="green"><b>New Discoveries and Inventions</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="green">●</font> That eccentric <b>Dr Landelbrot</b> is still experimenting with Random Events aboard his spaceship, the <a href="//www.neopets.com/magma/portal/">Coincidence</a>. If you bring him a few items for his tinkering, you can get a guaranteed not-so-Random Event to happen to you in exchange. The effects range from Neopet stat boosts to stolen items to... well, absolutely nothing whatsoever. They can't all be winners. Since the items being asked for come in batches, everyday items in Neopia -- such as fish, Tombola prizes, and cheap books -- are suddenly and briefly spiking in price as they are requested by Dr Landelbrot.
<br><br><font color="green">●</font> If you're travelling to Kiko Lake, check out the new daily activity <a href="//www.neopets.com/worlds/kiko/kpop/">Kiko Pop</a>. By throwing a dart to pop a balloon, you can win a large variety of prizes, including food, toys, books, and an avatar. (NB: Loud music starts playing as soon as this page loads.)
<br><br><font color="green">●</font> One of this year's biggest announcements was the discovery of an entirely new species of Neopet. Never before seen in Neopia, the <b>Vandagyre</b> is a cute feathered mammal with a fluffy face. Curiously, despite being a post-customisation design, it's incompatible with a lot of clothes -- but more are being added all the time that it can wear.
<br><br><font color="green">●</font> If it's your pet's <b>birthday</b>, you can now visit his/her lookup for some good wishes and free cake from TNT. The cake will help you to train your pet for the Battledome -- who said junk food can't be good for you?</p>

<font color="purple"><b>Major Events</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="purple">●</font> <b>April Fools' Day</b> tugged at a few heartstrings this year, as Dr. Death finally got sick of running the Neopian Pound and took the day off, leaving ordinary Neopians to look after the thousands of homeless Neopets in his place.<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> Congratulations to Team Haunted Woods, who came top of this year's <b>Altador Cup</b> and left the crowd screaming... in delight, I hope.
<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> When the royals of the <b>Lost Desert</b> threw a party this year, some surprisingly coordinated gangs of thieves stole the guests' valuables from under their noses, requiring several days of puzzle-solving work to figure out who stole what. On the plus side, at least nobody got murdered this time.
<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> A kindly old Acara, <b>Granny Hopbobbin</b>, encouraged Neopians to donate their toys to a good cause during the Winter Starlight Celebration. Those who did received random rewards, prompting some players to hand in literally thousands of toys.</p>



<hr><br><br><font size="6" face="mistral">Year 15</font><br><br><font color="red"><b>Policy Decisions</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="red">●</font> Nothing yet...</p>

<font color="blue"><b>Revamps</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="blue">●</font> It's been a long time coming, but <b>Tyrannia</b> finally got its revamp this year. If it's been a while since you've set foot or paw in those dry plains and lush jungles, come and see flying Pteridactyls, bright paintings and the new Ugga Shinies shop.</p>

<font color="green"><b>New Discoveries and Inventions</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="green">●</font> The new <b>Upcycle Fortune Cookie</b> from the NC Mall allows certain Neocash items to appear in the Money Tree when the cookie's users donate them. They will be listed as donated by "a generous NC Mall shopper". So far, only relatively cheap items seem to show up (more expensive ones can be donated, but will not appear).
<br><br><font color="green">●</font> The <b>Pastel Paint Brush</b> was an early gift for the Day of Giving this year. Its soft, fabric-like colours are sure to be a hit with those who like their pets to be pretty in pink, purple, and peppermint-green.</p>

<font color="purple"><b>Major Events</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="purple">●</font> April Fools' Day this year was somewhat quiet on the Neopets Team's part, but they did announce the upcoming release of a new line of real-life merchandise. Unfortunately, with items such as Sophie's Stew-Flavoured Tea and the Home Cosmetic Surgery Kit, it's doubtful their sales would have been much to write home about. The items "inexplicably" vanished from the Merchandise page the following day.
<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> A strange and powerful <b>obelisk</b> was discovered on the outskirts of Tyrannia this spring. Six factions immediately started fighting over it, making use of the newly revamped Battledome. Eventually, the Sway, an influential group of plotters and social manipulators, were successful in freeing a mysterious being called the Oracle. Smaller fights <a href="//www.neopets.com/prehistoric/battleground/">continue</a>, but what further consequences this will have for Neopia is still unknown.<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> It's been a big year for Tyrannia! A war, a revamp, and first place in <b>Altador Cup VIII</b>. Let's hear some roars for the dinosaurs.<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> While Aristotle Avinroo was off on holiday this summer, a young Zafara named Chadley helped Abigail run <b>Daily Dare</b>. If you thought it wasn't possible to get more arrogant than AAA, well, let's just say this guy managed it! Normal service has been restored, thank goodness.
<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> During the Month of Collecting, an <b>eating contest</b> in the Haunted Woods went horribly wrong when one of the contestants transformed into a rampaging monster. Hotshot monster-hunting team Kell the Wocky and Corbin the Ogrin (who, all agree, has beautiful, beautiful hair) went in search of it, with assistance from players who wandered around catacombs getting hit by stray curses until the creature was captured.</p>


<hr><br><br><font size="6" face="mistral">Year 14</font><br><br><font color="red"><b>Policy Decisions</b></font>
<p align="left"><font color="red">●</font> Neopets has moved closer to its fan community with the introduction of <a href="//www.neopets.com/fansites/index.phtml">Certified Fan Sites</a>! If TNT find a really useful site that complies with the right rules and regulations, they may decide to list it on Neopets. Tried and trusted fansites can be mentioned on the Neoboards without fear of the moderators!

 <br><br><font color="red">●</font><b>Neopets Premium</b> was overhauled this summer, with the newly revamped service being run by the Neopets Team themselves rather than a third party. This has led to some important decisions from TNT. Notably, <b>Neopets Webmail</b> has been retired and can no longer be accessed. The <b>Premium Portal</b> is also gone, and at the moment the Premium service no longer requires an <b>invitation</b> to sign up. Perhaps most noticeably, Premium members are permitted to own <b>a fifth Neopet</b>. This is currently allowed <i>only</i> on main accounts.

<br><br><font color="red">●</font>The navigation bar was tweaked a little this year to contain the new <b>Premium</b> and <b>Community</b> menus. Pet Central can now be found in the Explore menu, rather than as its own category.

<br><br><font color="red">●</font> It's the end of an era, and the beginning of one to come; TNT announced this year that the current <b>Neopets Battledome</b> would be closing permanently, giving way to a brand new battle arena, which entered beta-testing before the end of the year. Grab your weapons!</p>

<font color="blue"><b>Revamps</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="blue">●</font> The <b>Gameroom</b> was revamped once again this year, just in time for the Y14 Daily Dare. The functionality remains much the same, but you may need to update your bookmarks if you've got links to specific games anywhere. 
<br><br><font color="blue">●</font> After an infestation of bugs blockaded <b>Roo Island</b>, King Roo took the opportunity to call in the redecorators. The new island is much more spacious and detailed, but the surprise decision to relocate several of Neopia Central's creative venues to Roo Island left many players a little conflicted. 
<br><br><font color="blue">●</font> <a href="//www.neopets.com/sitespotlight.phtml">Site Spotlight</a> has returned! This contest showcases Neopia's greatest petpages, and all winners get a mention in New Features.<br><br><font color="blue">●</font> Several popular <b>daily activities</b>, such as the Lost Desert Fruit Machine and the Tombola, received tweaks this year -- new artwork, a larger range of possible prizes, or both. </p>

<font color="green"><b>New Discoveries and Inventions</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="green">●</font> The new <b>Eventide</b> Paint Brush invented this year lets your Neopets glow with all the colours of a beautiful sunset. How romantic!
<br><br><font color="green">●</font> Whether you're a veteran or a newbie, your Neopet can now look ancient and full of wisdom -- or possibly just crotchetiness -- with the new <b>Get Off My Lawn Paint Brush</b>, introduced this spring. This paint brush, like Royal, has two different looks, Elderly Boy and Elderly Girl.  
<br><br><font color="green">●</font> What's that lurking in the shadows?! It could be a Neopet painted with the new <b>Stealth Paint Brush</b>, this summer's shadiest addition. Not quite the same as Shadow, Stealth comes in a very shifty deep blue.
<br><br><font color="green">●</font> A deep cavern in Shenkuu holds the <a href="//www.neopets.com/shenkuu/neggcave/index.phtml">Mysterious Clockwork Negg</a>. Originally hidden away from Neopia by a band of brave Neopets, this mechanical marvel is now safe to open. The puzzle locks on it can be solved once a day for a variety of prizes.
<br><br><font color="green">●</font> It glows, but it's not Glowing. It's bright blue, but it's not Electric. The new <b>Dimensional Paint Brush</b> introduced this autumn gives Neopets a very futuristic look!

</p>

<font color="purple"><b>Major Events</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="purple">●</font> <b>April Fools' Day</b> fell on a Sunday this year, but that didn't stop TNT doing their level best to alarm and amuse players. A supposedly misfiring lab ray and a new three-pet policy to save on server overload were just two of the hair-raising hoaxes played on Neopets users this year. Unfortunately, some pets' unconverted appearances failed to correctly return to normal on time when the event finished, leaving certain players with a sadly sour impression of the day's pranks.<br><br><font color="purple">●</font>Congratulations to <b>Team Kreludor</b> (which just so happened to include yours truly!) for throwing, slinging, and yelling their way to a triumphant victory in <b>Altador Cup VII</b>. </p>


<hr><center>
<font size="6" face="mistral">Year 13</font><p></p>
</center>
<font color="red"><b>Policy Decisions</b></font>
<p align="left"><font color="red">●</font> This year, TNT decided to build their Facebook presence more closely into the main Neopets site. As such, the word "Facebook" is no longer blocked on petpages or the boards, and Flash games can now be "liked" at a click of a button. (If you really hate these buttons and don't want to see them at all, go <a href="//www.neopets.com/preferences.phtml">here</a>.) Linking to or talking about your own Facebook profile or friends is still against the rules, though.</p>

<font color="blue"><b>Revamps</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="blue">●</font> With the rebuilding of Faerieland comes the return of <b>Faerie Quests</b>! These work in much the same way as they always did, with the exception that quest rewards are now granted to your <b>active pet</b> -- no more hoping the Faerie randomly picks your Battledomer. A new face also joined the quest team with the introduction of <b>Delina</b>, a Dark Faerie who has more time for craftwork and machinery than battledoming. She doesn't give stat boosts, but rather, exclusive Neocash items.
<br><br><font color="blue">●</font> <b>Krawk Island</b> is now divided into two areas: the main body of the island and its central harbour, Warf Wharf. Be sure to drop by and check out the new look... while keeping a tight hold on any money you might have with you.
</p>

<font color="green"><b>New Discoveries and Inventions</b></font><p align="left">

<font color="green">●</font> If you like your Neopets misty, murky and an acid shade of green, then the new <b>Swamp Gas</b> paintbrush, invented this summer, is certainly for you.<br><br><font color="green">●</font> Lab ray enthusiasts were intrigued by the arrival of a new lab-only colour. Designed to mimic the pixellated computer graphics that existed several years ago, <b>Eight-Bit</b> is proving to be something of a polarising colour-- most people have a strong opinion of some sort about it. At the moment, it appears that this colour is <i>not</i> compatible with most clothing items, making it the fifth "uncustomisable" colour on the site.<br><br><font color="green">●</font> A new chance game made its debut this year, aimed at those who really do have more money than they know what to do with. The <a href="//www.neopets.com/desert/extravagance.phtml">Wheel of Extravagance</a> costs a whopping 100,000 Neopoints <i>per spin</i>, but gives out some rather spectacular prizes in return. Come and try your luck if you can spare the NP...<br><br><font color="green">●</font> Ever looked at your Slorg and felt it was just missing a hat and some mascara? A robe for your Seece? Petpets can now be painted <b>Royal</b>!
<br><br><font color="green">●</font> The <b>Water Paint Brush</b> invented this summer will certainly cool your Neopets down! Unlike Maraquan, this colour is actually made out of sparkling blue water, for a rather unique new look.
<br><br><font color="green">●</font> Released just in time for the dark and spooky nights of autumn, the <b>Wraith Paint Brush</b> will make your Neopet as shadowy and mysterious as one of the Faeries' Ruin wraiths! Don't get scared of the dark.

</p>

<font color="purple"><b>Major Events</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="purple">●</font> Early this summer, Neopets reached <b>ONE TRILLION</b> pageviews. That's one heck of a big number! To celebrate, several rare items were given away or sold at low prices. Here's to the next trillion!
<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> <b>Altador Cup VI</b> drew to a close this summer with a win for Team Virtupets, who managed to pull off a well-earned victory despite glitches resulting from a last-minute revamp of Yooyuball. Congratulations to all who took part!<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> <b>Krawk Island</b> disappeared unexpectedly this year after sightings of what looked like a giant squid. However, it returned better than before thanks to the efforts of an enterprising Krawk, Gavril McGill.


<br></p>
<hr><br><font size="6" face="mistral">Year 12</font><p></p>
</center>
<font color="red"><b>Policy Decisions</b></font>
<p align="left"><font color="red">●</font> Unconverted (UC) pets, that is, pets whose owners have still not made the switch to the current customisation system, are now <b>immune</b> to colour-changing random events such as Boochi and invisibility. Cue a sigh of relief from all UC owners.

<br><br><font color="red">●</font> <b>Support requests</b> can now be tracked at any time of day or night.  Just click "Help" at the foot of any page and press "My Support" (if the page refreshes, try it again). No more wondering if your bug report was eaten by gerbils.

<br><br><font color="red">●</font> In early autumn, the <a href="/terms.phtml">Terms and Conditions</a> of the site were revised. There were no major changes, but the terms were made a bit less specific so they could also apply to Petpet Park (and any future spinoffs). Apparently the collective term for these is "Nickelodeon Virtual Worlds" -- swish, huh?

<br><br><font color="red">●</font> Watch your mouth! People who say something they shouldn't on the boards or Neomail can now be <b>silenced</b> instead of being suspended or frozen. They can still use their accounts, but for a set amount of time will be unable to communicate with any other users. Kad got your tongue?


</p>

<font color="blue"><b>Revamps</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="blue">●</font> The most striking change this year was <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/index.phtml">Faerieland</a>s relocation from the sky to a lovely leafy glade near the Haunted Woods. All Neopia's mistresses of magic now live in a completely redesigned city full of plants and grasses. How could anyone ever miss being up on a cloud? (If you've been avoiding Faerieland due to its not safe for dial-up qualities, now might be a good time to check again!)<br><br><font color="blue">●</font> TNT began working on new looks for many of the Neopian <b>shopkeepers</b> this year. They now look more individual and colourful than before, though for the most part they have remained the same species and colour.<br><br><font color="blue">●</font> The <a href="/linktous.phtml">Referral Programme</a> was overhauled this year, to provide more useful prizes and clear out ancient high-score tables. Don't worry if you've used link buttons on your favourite non-Neopets sites, though-- your old referral link will still work.<br><br><font color="blue">●</font> After many years of loyal service, the <b>chance wheels</b> of Neopia (Excitement, Monotony, Mediocrity, Misfortune and Knowledge) broke down this year. An enterprising red Lenny collected donations from Neopians to save them, and the wheels returned in more beautiful and functional forms. Unfortunately, the Wheel of Excitement's "secret item" still does absolutely nothing...<br><br><font color="blue">●</font> The <b>login page</b> was altered this year to be similar to Petpet Park's. According to TNT, despite the absence of active Neopet verification, the new page is considerably safer.
 </p>

<font color="green"><b>New Discoveries and Inventions</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="green">●</font> On April 1st, a brand new paint brush made its way into Neopia... but for once, this new addition wasn't a joke! The <b>Relic PB</b> turns Neopets into ancient statues from a long-gone civilisation. Only a handful of Relic pets are available as yet, but expect more to be added over the year.<br><br><font color="green">●</font> Users over three years old on the site can now access the <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/garage.phtml">Almost Abandoned Attic</a>, a quiet little nook inhabited by a friendly Ghost Aisha. This shop works the same way as the <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/igloo.phtml">Igloo Garage Sale</a>, but there are some rarer items there that have only just seen the light of day. If you're a veteran on a <i>very</i> fast connection, come and have a rummage! There are several other new treats for long-time players, too, including an increased number of <b>safe transfers</b> per month. Click <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Svid">here</a> for a complete list.<br><br><font color="green">●</font> Remember Neoplants and the idea of owning a plant as your pet? Well, whether you do or you don't, your pet now has the chance to become a little closer to nature with the <b>Woodland Paint Brush</b>, introduced in June. With leaves, bark and twigs attached, the Acara was the first pet to be made into a tree... without having a wooden look on its face.<br><br><font color="green">●</font> It's not just Neopets that hunger for your brains any more. Petpets can now be painted <b>Zombie</b>! Run!<br><br><font color="green">●</font> The <b>Transparent Paint Brush</b> debuted this year, allowing curious owners to see right through their pets' skin. Mad scientist wannabes, this one's for you.<br><br><font color="green">●</font> It's rare for a new site feature to be full of bugs on purpose, but this year saw the introduction of a game called <b>Professor Milton Clodbottle's Astounding Habitarium</b>. This game, where players looked after a collection of Petpetpets as they worked, ate, and slept, was such a reliable source of easy Neopoints that it caused considerable inflation in the Neopian economy until it was retired in Year Sixteen.
<br><br><font color="green">●</font> The beautiful <b>Maractite Paint Brush</b> also made its first appearance this year, creating a lovely blue-swirled look for your pet.

<font color="purple"><b>Major Events</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="purple">●</font> A new Neopian holiday was celebrated for the first time this year. The <b>Festival of Neggs</b> was a tribute to Neopia's most versatile vegetable. If you can think of a good reason for this, please tell me.<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> April Fools' Day saw the first ever <i>interactive</i> pranks being played on Neopians, with users able to throw pie, short-duration morphing potions and Slorg slime at their friends' pets. These wearable items disappeared when the day was over, but in the meantime they made for a lot of fun!<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> <b>Tarla</b>, proprietor of the Shop of Mystery, decided to set off on a short holiday around Neopia early this year. For a few weeks, she turned up in random spots around Neopia and those who clicked her could get prizes, including special wearables if you managed to collect a certain number of successful clicks. But eventually, Tarla returned to Terror Mountain to find that there's no place like home. All together now... Awwwwww!<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> It may not qualify as a <i>major</i> event, but this year saw the rise of what is possibly the first spontaneous Neopets-only meme. In response to an editorial question about contest judging, TNT picked a random Caption Contest entry out of their virtual hat and displayed it in the NT. It turned out to be a bizarre, over-wordy and strangely phrased dialogue between two (or possibly three) characters, ending with the words "GOOD NIGHT, mr. coconut". Something in the absurd humour of this has taken Neopia by storm, and now it's not uncommon to see references to Mr. Coconut in the editorial or on the boards.<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> The fifth <b>Altador Cup</b> ended in a thrilling win for <b>Team Lost Desert</b>. Congratulations to all the LD players! Meanwhile in Glendale, <b>Twitterpate</b> scooped a win for Mystery Island in the Staff Yooyuball Tournament.<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> Tragedy struck the <b>Faerie Festival</b> this autumn as Neopia's Faeries were turned into statues. After many thrills and spills, the culprit-- a student of Fyora's, no less-- was tracked down by heroic warrior <b>Brynn</b> and dashing thief <b>Hanso</b>. The Faeries were restored, but have they learnt their lesson about acting too superior? Only time will tell.

<hr><br><br><font size="6" face="mistral">Year 11</font><br><br><font color="red"><b>Policy Decisions</b></font>
<p align="left"><font color="red">●</font> All new games on the site are now the subjects of the <b>New Game Challenge</b>. They can be played <b>five times</b> for Neopoints, and players are invited to beat target scores. Both these things end when another new game is released and the challenge moves to it.<br><br><font color="red">●</font> The image URLs for <b>pet images</b> were tweaked this year, causing a few unexpected glitches. If your pet is showing up as a grey cogwheel or a bizarre colour/species combination, put an item of clothing on hir, save, and take it off again. (For you UC owners-- backgrounds work too.)</p>

<font color="blue"><b>Revamps</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="blue">●</font> <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/index.phtml">Faerieland</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/index.phtml">Terror Mountain</a> both got a long-needed revamp this year. With the revamp has come a couple of changes-- the Hidden Tower is now to the east, not the west, of the castle in Faerie City, and the Wocky's Scratchcard Kiosk is now out in the open air in Happy Valley.<br><br><font color="blue">●</font> The site menu at the top of every page has undergone a few tweaks. TNT decided to retire the Neovision contest due to lack of interest, and so its button has been removed. For those who can't get enough of personalising things, there is now a "Customisation" menu. (Yes, Customi<b>s</b>ation. The site is sticking to its British roots. I'm so proud...)</p>

<font color="green"><b>New Discoveries and Inventions</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="green">●</font> Undoubtedly the biggest discovery this year was the underground world of <a href="//www.neopets.com/magma/index.phtml">Moltara</a>, a strange place filled with Neopets of above-average technical ingenuity, as well as with a fair amount of lava. Drop by and visit the caverns or the Cog's Togs clothing shop (guaranteed 100% more buckles and buttons than you expected). You can also try to get your pet painted <b>Magma</b> at the lava pool, but don't hold your breath-- it's a random small chance that you'll be able to get through. Keep trying if you're persistent.<br><br><font color="green">●</font> This year, the mystery behind the coveted <b>Chef Bonju Avatar</b> was finally solved after a few hints from TNT. To unlock it, you must have the "Mad about Orange" avatar active, and mix the items Blumaroo Steak, Orange Juice and Gourmet Cooking for your Pet at the <i>Mystery Island</i> <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/cookingpot.phtml">cooking pot</a> (NB: <i>not</i> Bonju's cooking vessel). However, this avatar is only unlockable during the <b>Month of Hiding</b>.</p>

<font color="purple"><b>Major Events</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="purple">●</font> The fourth annual <b>Altador Cup</b> ended with a win for the ever enthusiastic <b>Team Krawk Island</b>. The prizes for this year's tournament were seen by many as being a little lacklustre compared to previous years.<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> The <a href="//www.neopets.com/aota/">Atlas of the Ancients</a> adventure, a primarily Flash-game based challenge with its own storyline, saw <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=143">Roxton Colchester III</a> and his newest companions, <b>Clara Chatham</b> and <b>Jordie</b>, set off on an epic quest to save the world from an unknown danger with the help of an old mapbook, which eventually led them to the underground world of Moltara. While Roxton fans were glad to see him back, many players found the dependence on Flash gaming a bit of a disappointment. </p>

</center>
<font color="red"><b>Policy Decisions</b></font>
<p align="left"><font color="red">●</font> After almost exactly a year of downtime, the Neopian Pound was reopened this year, with a few new policies: <b>pets' clothes</b> are now taken away from them when they enter the Pound; transfers to a specific owner should now be carried out using the <a href="//www.neopets.com/pound/transfer.phtml">Transfer Hissi</a>, which is risk-free but can only be done once a month; and most controversially of all, users are now permitted to <b>trade their Neopets</b> if they want. Trades must be a single pet for a single pet, with no other factors (such as Petpets) being used to bypass this balance. Meanwhile, a new <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=34">Neoboard</a> was created for people to discuss adoption and pet trading.<br><br><font color="red">●</font> Players are now allowed to enter the <a href="//www.neopets.com/beauty/index.phtml">Beauty Contest</a> from <i>any</i> of their accounts, rather than from their main as was previously the case. However, you still may only <b>advertise</b> from the account the pet in question lives on, so no using your main to promote your side account pets even if it's better known.</p>

<font color="blue"><b>Revamps</b></font><p align="left">
No major revamps this year!</p>

<font color="green"><b>New Discoveries and Inventions</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="green">●</font> TNT introduced a spin-off game, <b>Petpet Park</b>, this year. This Flash-heavy website was a little like Neopets, but a much simpler and more colourful game apparently aimed at a younger target audience. Players would adopt a single Petpet which they could feed, groom, accessorise, and help to complete quests. While it's no longer available, this game gave plenty of players fond memories.</p>

<font color="purple"><b>Major Events</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="purple">●</font> <b>Dr. Sloth</b> tried to invade again in this year, beginning with Virtupets and Kreludor. However, a brave group of Neopets (including <b>Gorix</b> and <b>Cylara</b>, previous stars of a few Flash games) and some puzzle-solving Neopians managed to fend him off, and trap him inside a token. Neopia is safe again... for now.<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> With <b>Petpet Park</b> on TNT's minds, news that the Park might have problems due to missing Petpets was quite a concern. An ace team of Neopets from the <b>Petpet Protection League</b> set out to rescue the Petpets, and managed to secure them all before the launch date. Phew!</p>

<hr><br><br><center>
<font size="6" face="mistral">Year 9</font><p></p>
</center>
<font color="red"><b>Policy Decisions</b></font>
<p align="left"><font color="red">●</font> From Year Nine, Neopets are now allowed to wear clothes other than those that come with a paintbrush. Clothes can still come from painting a pet, of course, but can also be bought around the site or claimed in return for donating Realworld money (see below). A painted pet wearing the clothes that come with a different colour of paintbrush is known as "cross-painted". Be aware-- not all clothes will go with the pet when s/he is transferred (and none when s/he is disowned-- see above under Year 10's Policy Decisions).</p>

<font color="blue"><b>Revamps</b></font>
<p align="left">
<font color="blue">●</font> In the largest-scale redraw operation in Neopia's history, every single species and colour of pet in existence was at least tweaked and at most completely overhauled. Because TNT realised the revamps came as a shock to those with certain unusually coloured pets, they allowed those owners to choose for themselves when to join the new revamp, by clicking a button in Quick Ref. Two years later, a fair few of them still haven't. Pets whose owners still have yet to make the switch are called UC, short for "unconverted".<br><br><font color="blue">●</font> This year also saw a reworking of the site's structure, with a menu-style bar replacing the old side panel, a Quick Ref pane being installed on the side so users can always see their active Neopets, and a change to the way event notifications were handled.</p>

<font color="green"><b>New Discoveries and Inventions</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="green">●</font> Those who wish to donate Realworld money to Neopets without the monthly commitment of <a href="/~Leto">Premium</a> can now not only do just that, but choose from a variety of attractive virtual trinkets in exchange at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/mall/index.phtml">NC Mall</a>, a special shop that doesn't accept Neopoints. Instead, players sending money will be given a certain amount of "NC tokens" in exchange, which they can then use in the shop. The items bought from the NC Mall can be worn by a pet or displayed in a gallery, but they aren't "real" items-- they can't be sold, traded, donated, discarded or sent to side accounts. If you don't have the money to get NC, you can try to win some in the free <a href="http://ncmall.neopets.com/mall/shop.phtml?page=giveaway">Qasalan Expellibox Game</a>, which can be played once a day. Be warned, it can also make your pet sick! <br><br><font color="green">●</font> A <b>meteor</b> crash-landed on Kreludor this year. If you feel like poking the giant lump of rock with a stick, some nice surprises could be in store.</p>

<font color="purple"><b>Major Events</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="purple">●</font> Gorgeously dashing, suave, debonair, smooth, intelligent, daring heartthrob... *ahem* ...Lutari explorer <b>Roxton Colchester III</b> set out this year with companions <b>Lilian Fairweather</b>, <b>Professor Hugo</b> and <b>Scrap</b> to check out an unexplored area of the ocean. This <b>Journey to the Lost Isle</b> brought the intrepid group no end of perils and upsets, including the menacing attention of a Monstrous Moach. They escaped the island intact, but haven't been back since, and many people think a return trip should be in order. The Isle still isn't marked on the map of Neopia, and what it contains other than giant Moaches remains a mystery.</p>

</center>
<font color="red"><b>Policy Decisions</b></font>
<p align="left"><font color="red">●</font> As of this year, news updates are now released several hours in <b>advance</b>. This was a welcome change, as the update time had been pushed back so far that most people were only finding out about a day's events a few hours before they ended. News is now released on weekday evenings, with Friday's updates covering the weekend.<br><br><font color="red">●</font> You can now <a href="//www.neopets.com/pin_prefs.phtml">add a <b>P.I.N.</b>(Protection in Neopia) code</a>  to several important areas of your account. That way, even if your account gets compromised, nobody can steal your pets or Neopoints!<br><br><font color="red">●</font> The limit on bank deposits was removed this year. Rich Neopians or those transferring money to a new main account are no longer limited to depositing a million NP at a time.</p>

<font color="blue"><b>Revamps</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="blue">●</font> This year, the view of Neopia on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/explore.phtml">Explore page</a> was changed from a simple map to a globe! Believe it or not, some Neopians were surprised to discover that their planet <i>had</i> more than one side. You can now spin the globe to your heart's content and study the countries on every side of it.<br><br><font color="blue">●</font> A new filter was installed for petpages and pet descriptions this year. Many people were having problems with badly formed code, so the new filter (unlike the Neoboard filters, sadly) actually tries to point out any mistakes or disallowed words it spots in petpage code. Great if you're sick of seeing error messages!<br><br></p>

<font color="green"><b>New Discoveries and Inventions</b></font><p align="left">
<font color="green">●</font> This was the first year when the <b>Altador mini-plot</b> was open to the public. Unlike a normal plot, this activity has never been closed, and players can go through the steps in their own time. Be sure to visit the <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/archives.phtml">Archives</a> for your share of puzzles, mysteries and the triumphant return of the Angry Yurble!<br><br><font color="green">●</font>  A mysterious flying ship landed on Neopia's coasts this year. The crew of the <b>Cyodrake's Gaze</b> were having a bit of an altercation, but with it sorted out, they were free to return to their homeland of <a href="//www.neopets.com/shenkuu/index.phtml">Shenkuu</a>, home of a fascinating moon-centric culture, a royal family <i>not</i> composed of Skeiths for once, interesting food items and Neopia's tallest and skinniest Neopets.<br><br><font color="green">●</font> In the spring of this year, a new pet species was discovered: the <a href="//www.neopets.com/petinfo.phtml?type=Lutari">Lutari</a>. These furry creatures are equally happy on land or in the water. Unfortunately, since they <b>cannot be transferred or disowned in any way</b> and there are no morphing potions at present, they have eclipsed the Draik and Krawk as Neopia's hardest-to-obtain pet. The <i>only</i> way to get a Lutari of your very own is to zap one at the lab, or hope with all your fingers crossed that TNT decide to release a batch on Lutari Day. This was the second new species to be officially announced in Year 8: at the very start of the year, the <a href="//www.neopets.com/petinfo.phtml?type=Gnorbu">Gnorbu</a> (pronounced with a silent G) was introduced. These are <i>not</i> Limited Edition, so anyone can own one. </p>

<font color="purple"><b>Major Events</b></font><p align="left">

<font color="purple">●</font> Lovers of all things spooky, gothic and bittersweet, as well as avid puzzle-solvers, got a real treat this year. Gilly the Usul, best known for starring in <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/elivthade.phtml">The Castle of Eliv Thade</a>, helped the tiny village of <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/neovia.phtml">Neovia</a> to overcome its terrible curse by investigating its <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/hwp/comic.phtml?prologue=1">Tale of Woe</a>. This site event is widely ranked alongside the Lost Desert Plot as one of the best ever to happen on the site, thanks to its variety of challenges and engaging story.<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> Year 8 saw the first annual <b>Altador Cup</b> tournament, in which players participate in a special Flash game, <b>Yooyuball</b>, which is completely unavailable during the rest of the year! You can pick your favourite Neopian land and play for its team, whether it's Tyrannia, Kiko Lake or Krawk Island.<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> It's been quite the year for Flash gamers! This year also saw the introduction of the <b>Gamesmaster's Challenge</b>, a Flash game competition that proved so popular it's been brought back every year since. Players try to complete challenges set by the so-called Gamesmaster, <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=127">Aristotle A. Avinroo</a> (commonly known as AAA, which also sounds conveniently like "aaagh" for those times when you just can't manage the challenge...) There are trophies and prizes for those who succeed.</p>

If you're lucky enough to smuggle some leftovers out of this upmarket venue, you could get an avatar.<br><br><font color="purple">●</font> Often argued to be the greatest puzzle plot <i>ever</i>, the <b>Lost Desert Plot</b> kicked off this year. Sakhmet City vanished from the desert after a cursed prince laid a spell on the entire place, and it was up to the plucky children <b>Nabile and Tomos</b>, and intelligent, determined and patient Neopians everywhere, to restore order. This plot marked the first appearance of the famous <b>Angry Yurble</b>, a nameless orange figure curiously beloved to plot-solvers everywhere, and is thought to be the origin of the fandom term "Obsessive Latest Darn' Plot Disorder" (OLDPD). It's remembered fondly to this day.</p>
