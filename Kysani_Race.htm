I created a table below that shows time to beat each Act.  I provided an estimated, average time it should take to beat each Act as well as a max time.  If you are on the max time, or above it, you need to try and push yourself through other acts.  Remember you want to be under the fastest race times.
<br><br>

The times shown on the table are not what you should be aiming for to finish each acts.  Try and finish it under the estimated time if you can, and you will be looking good with a race trophy.  If you are on or above the max times of each act, be aware of the time you have left while proceeding to other acts.  If you are above the max time on about three acts, it might be looking bad.  You still have a chance, you better push it to the limit!</font></p>

<font color="pink"><b>  - <font color="lime">Strategy for Act <font color="gold">I<font color="pink"> -

<br><br><p align="left">  <font color="skyblue">Start off by switching to "Hunting" mode as soon as you walk outside Trestin Village.  Start leveling up by defeating the Plains Aishas and Plains Lupe.  Do not consume any minor healing potions.  If you need to heal just go to Rohane's mother.  Keep doing this until you reach level 5.  Put all your points into <font color="pink">Damage Increase</font> each level.  This is the talent point you need to max out first and foremost.  You can sneak in 1 point into Critical Hit so you have a slight chance of doing great damage.  Once you are level 5, you should have near 15+ potions.  Switch to "Normal" mode now and go to the cave.  You can either hunt here, or stay with normal movement.  Make your way down to the Miner Foreman and defeat him.  Proceed to the orb, and get outside the cave.  Switch back to "Hunting" and hunt your way down to White River City.  If you followed the instructions above you should have enough gold to purchase <font color="green">Iron Shortsword</font>.  <br><font color="red">Do not vendor the Father's Sword, it will help you greatly in Act 5.</font><br><br>

As soon as you purchased your new sword, step back outside the village and be at "Hunting."  Start leveling up here!  I would recommend level 9 before entering the tower, but level 8 would really help your time.  You can consume potions if you want to save time by not resting at the inn.  Just make sure you have around 15 minor potions and a few flasks in hand before entering the tower.  Whatever level you decide to do; once you reach it, go back into town.  Go to the shopkeeper and buy <font color="green">Blast Potions</font> (You don't have to, but it can speed things up, not guranteed).  Make your way into the cave, switch to "Normal," and follow the puddles.  Go up all the levels of the mysterious towers.  The skeletal knights here are pretty painful, but the <font color="green">Blast Potions</font> if you chose to buy them can fix this. Once you are at the top, you are ready to face Zombom.  Do not let your health drop below 31, his decimate direct damage ability does approximately 31 damage which can end you.  Otherwise, use the <font color="green">Blast Potions</font> you bought on him.  It will do around 25 damage but has chances of resisting.  If you didn't buy <font color="green">Blast Potions</font>, just finish him off with regular attacks.  Once you are done, go to the orb and make your way back to town.<br><br>

When you are back in town, head down and ask Mipsy to join your party.  Put all your talent points into <font color="pink">Group Direct Damage</font>.  You can choose here either to "Hunt" or to go "Normal."  No matter what, you will need to level.  Personally I went "Normal" mode and headed straight down to Town of Lakeside.  After you've reached the town, talk to the hermit so he gives you the secret word for the lost city.  Head back out and switch to "Hunting."  You have to level up here.  Use potions if you are weak, but make sure you have spare.  Same as last time.  Keep in mind that this town's inn is further than White River Village, so use your judgment.  Once about level 12 or 13, head to town and make a quick stop by the potion shop.  Buy at least 3 <font color="green">Dawdling Potions</font> to ensure a safe victory on Sand Grundo.  If you want to buy damage potions, you can, but Mipsy should already be doing quite a bit of damage output.  Switch to "Normal" and make your way down to the Lost City of Phorofor.  Proceed down to the Sand Grundo.  Use your <font color="green">Dawdling Potions</font> to make sure he is slowed for a safe victory.  Proceed to the orb after he is dead.<br><br>





The orb takes you up to the tower on the hill.  Make sure your movement setting is still at normal.  Fight and make your way out of the towers.  You should end up in South East Meridell.  Make your way across the map to the Village of Seaside.  You can spend some gold here on upgrades, or you can wait for boss drops.  The choice is completely yours!  You can talk to Uthyni to receive a discount on potions, but personally I think it's a huge waste of 2 minutes, considering that you have excess gold anyway.  Once you are at the town, buy some <font color="green">Dawdling Potions</font>.  I'd say around 5 or more (Hint:  You want them for the beginning of Act II).  Buy some <font color="green">Flame Potions</font>, or <font color="green">Burst Potions</font> to defeat Ramtor quick.  You will also want some for the beginning of Act II as well.  When you are ready, proceed down to Meridell Castle in "Normal".<br><br>

Once you've reached Meridell Castle, fight Ramtor and make him flee.  You should be able to talk to the guard now for a free resting area, and a checkpoint.  Switch to "Hunting" now and level up outside against the Dire Lupes, Mist Gelert, and Fierce Bearogs.  If you need to heal go inside the Meridell Castle, the guard on the top will provide you with rest for free.  Be aware of time constraints, sometimes it would be better to use potions instead.  Do this until you are around 18.<br><br>

After 15/15 <font color="pink">Damage Increase</font> for Rohane and after 15/15 <font color="pink">Group Direct Damage</font> for Mipsy; put your points for Rohane into a mix of <font color="pink">Innate Melee Haste</font> and <font color="pink">Critical Hits</font>.  Put your points for Mipsy into a mix of <font color="pink">Group Haste</font>, <font color="pink">Innate Melee Defense</font>, and <font color="pink">Innate Haste</font>.  More <font color="pink">Innate Haste</font> just for the fact that <font color="pink">Group Direct Damage</font> has a slow recharge time.  <font color="pink">Group Haste </font>should also be higher than <font color="pink">Innate Melee Defense</font>.  Just work it out yourself ;).<br><br>


Once you are 18, switch to "Normal" and make your way to Ramtor's Tower.  Complete the maze and reach the top of the tower.  Ramtor is on the bottom left hand side of the uppermost level.  Head to him and fight him.  Use your damage potions and heal when necessary.  Proceed to Act II!<br><br><font color="orange">How long did this Act take you?  Refer to the tables at the beginning of the petpage and compare it to your time.  This will tell you if you need to push the next act.</font>

<font color="pink"><b>  - <font color="lime">Strategy for Act <font color="gold">II<font color="pink"> -

<br><br><p align="left"><font color="skyblue">You should be level 18 and somewhere close to level 19 when starting this act.  You can try and fight Leximp at 18 but it will take a lot of luck.  Start off by switching to "Hunting" and defeating the Snow Lupes and Alpine Bearogs.  You will need to use potions you gathered in Act I because you do not have the Wordstone to talk to the chias.  When you are level 19, switch to "Normal" and go to the Damp Smelly Cave.  Get to Leximp and use the leftover <font color="green">Dawdling Potions</font> on him.  If you don't he will have two attacks before you can have one, and you will fall behind in health points slowly.  You can also use the damage potions on him if you like.  Once he is dead, go back out of the cave, and enter Chia Oscuro.  Talk to Ullistl for free resting.  You can also buy appropriate upgrades from Jarasth if you like, or you can wait until you reach Happy Valley.  Go back outside and switch to "Hunting" and start leveling up here until 21.<br><br>

At level 21, switch back to "Normal" and venture your way up to the Caves of Terror.  Make your way through the cave to end up at the Eastern Pass, then go to the Mountainside Inn and ask Talinia to join your party.  Put all your initial talent points into <font color="pink">Increased Bow Damage</font> followed by the remaining points into <font color="pink"> Multi-Shot</font>.  Get up to 7 points into <font color="pink">Multi-Shot</font>, and then do a mix of talent points into <font color="pink">Slowing Strike</font>, and <font color="pink">Innate Melee Haste</font>.  It does not matter what you pick more than the other, as they will balance out anyway.<br><br>

After Talinia joins your party and you have the proper setup, switch to "Hunting" and go back outside.  Start leveling up here to at least level 23 or 24.  23 would help your time and 24 is a safe bet, use your judgment from the previous act's time.  Use the innkeeper or potions to restore health.  When you are ready, go back into the Mountainside Inn, and talk to Borhal, the shopkeeper.  Buy some <font color="green">Drowsiness Potions</font> to slow Kolvars.  You can also buy <font color="green"> Frost Potions</font> or <font color="green"> Chill Potions</font> to speed up the victories on Kolvars.  There is a town after Kolvars to buy better potions so don't waste too much gold buying excess amount.  Switch back to "Normal" and make your way up the Eastern Pass and win against Kolvars.  Go down to Happy Valley and enter from the southern side.  Talk to Jualie and then find her lost son.  Return to her and you will receive a permanent discount on everything.  Buy appropriate upgrades here.<br><br>

You will need to level up here again.  I suggest level 26 before heading over to the Adventurer's Camp.  Switch to "Hunting" and walk up to the path of Kolvars.  The monsters below the village are powerful and although they will reward more experience it is also a waste of time having to heal on every other move, or battle.  Defeat the Cliff Unis, Sleet Krawks, Frost Spyders, Mountain Lupes, and the Tuskainnies to level 26.  Use potions here to heal, and when all three of your party members sustain too much damage, talk to the innkeeper of Happy Valley to rest.  When you are level 26, go back inside Happy Valley and talk to Vanne, the potion keeper.  Sell all your leftover slowing and damage potions.  Buy some <font color="green">Chill Potions</font> as well as some <font color="green">Lethargy Potions</font>.<br><br>

Switch back to "Normal" and make your way to the Adventurer's Camp.  You need to level up here again.  Switch back to "Hunting" and hunt the monsters below the tent, the ones you fought making your way to the tent.  When you are level 27, go up to the cave and stay near the entrance to allow a free and safe escape back to the camp.  You can choose to level up to 28 or 29, either way it does not matter.  Use your judgment based on the time spent at this act.<br><br>

When you are at the right level, switch back to "Normal" and venture through all the cave levels.  Once you are at Lost Caves Level 4, talk to The Snowager first before heading to the Mountain Top.  If you manage to get into a random fight here with a Giant Frost Chia involved, defeat him first as quickly as possible.  Use your <font color="green">Chill Potions</font> if you have to.  Proceed to Scuzzy and challenge him.  Use your <font color="green">Lethargy Potions</font> to slow him.  Haste your group with Mipsy and slowly take him down.  You can also use your <font color="green">Chill Potions</font> for extra damage to speed up your time.  Proceed to Act III!<br><br><font color="orange">How long did this Act take you?  Refer to the tables at the beginning of the petpage and compare it to your time.  This will tell you if you need to push the next act.</font>

<br><br><p align="left"><font color="skyblue">It is recommended to be at level 29 before you even enter the Temple of the Sky.  If you are not, try and level up here.  Based on your time, decide whether you should proceed to Silicast or to level up prior.  When you are ready switch to "Normal" and enter the bottom left hut.  Rathuah will be your potion keeper.  Sell your leftovers and buy a couple of <font color="green">Potions of Loafing Laziness</font> and a couple of <font color="green">Scorch Potions</font> if you like.  You can choose to buy <font color="green">Scorch Potions</font> as an option, but <font color="green">Potions of Loafing Laziness</font> is very much mandatory at this point.  Also, purchase at least three <font color="green">Living Potions</font> in case your situation is bad.  Get out of the hut and make your way across the lost desert into the Temple of the Sky.<br><br>

You can skip most of the level here, just use a map accordingly and get to level two as soon as you can.  You can take on pretty much all the monsters you come across.  If you do come across a Mutant Sand Grundo, make sure that your priority is to cast <font color="pink">Group Haste</font> as a priority for Mipsy, and focus him first.  He will do a ton of damage that will cause you to fall behind, or even end you.  If you do manage to die however, you have <font color="green">Living Potions</font> to resurrect that party member.  When you reach Silicast, cast <font color="pink">Group Haste</font> and use your <font color="green">Potion of Loafing Laziness</font> on him.  Talinia's <font color="pink"> Slowing Strike</font> will further slow him down.  This is necessary to give you the amount of time to heal and to not be crushed, so make sure you have him slowed and yourself hasted at all times.  When Silicast dies, get to the orb and bring yourself back to Sahkmet City.<br><br>

If you can defeat Silicast, you are ready to vanquish Gebarn II, the resurrected krawk.  Stock up your potions if they are depleted, and get ready to go to the Ruined Temple.  You are still in "Normal" mode.  Make your way up to the last floor and fight Gebarn II.  He is not as hard compared to Silicast.  You don't have to slow him if you wish to save the potions, but you still want to keep <font color="pink">Group Haste</font> up to be safe.  When he is dead, again touch the orb and you will reappear in Sahkmet City.  Make your way back up to the Ruined Temple area again.  The mountains should be cleared which reveals a path to Waset Village.<br><br>

Pick up Velm, located at the bottom right hut.  Put all your points into <font color="pink"> Group Healing</font> first.  Whatever talents you have left should be spent accordingly:  4/15 <font color="pink">Innate Melee Defense</font>, 4/15 <font color="pink">Innate Haste</font>, and whatever left into <font color="pink">Group Shielding</font>.  You would want a couple of more points into <font color="pink"> Innate Melee Defense </font>.  Be sure to put the majority of the talent points into a split of <font color="pink">Group Shielding</font> for group defenses, and <font color="pink">Innate Haste</font> to allow Velm to recharge faster.Once you pick up Velm, everything should be cake.  Just cast Group Healing when needed and use the damage potions on him if you want a strong damage output by Velm.  If you find yourself in a situation where Velm is being pushed back his cast time, or memorized use your healing potions.<br><br>

You are still in "Normal" mode, make your way down to the Palace of Ancient Kings to rescue Lifira.  Go to the indicated secret stairs located on the third bed up, and make your way up to the second floor to fight The Revenant and his two hounds.  You do not have to use any slowing or damage potions here if you choose, but it can help speed things up.  Take out the hounds first, followed by the Revenant.  Talk to Lifira and take the orb that takes you outside of the palace.<br><br>

You are still in "Normal" mode.  After rescuing Lifira, talk to her in Waset Village.  After talking to her, talk to the hermit.  He will tell you where to find the second piece of the medallion.  After talking to the hermit, use a map provided and get the gem located in the northern mountains.  Completing that task will allow you entrance to Akhten-Kai.  When you get to Akhten-Kai, make your way up to Coltzan's Ghost.  Fight him the same way as you would fight the previous bosses.  Beware that Coltzan has a strong burst damage that can occur at any time, so it's strongly recommended that Mipsy casts <font color="pink">Group Haste</font> and that Velm casts <font color="pink">Group Shielding</font>.  You can choose to keep him slowed if you want, but it's not necessary.  When he is dead, talk to him then take the gem piece that is hidden inside the barrel.  When you collected that gem piece, head outside and go up the mountains.  Go up until you see mountains that form what seems to be like a smiley face.  If you notice, the face is missing his nose, which is where the last and final gem of the medallion is.  When you pick it up, the entrance to Zakharukh's Pyramid should be revealed.<br><br>

You are still in "Normal" mode.  Make your way back to Waset Village and stock up your potions accordingly.  Then venture your way into Zakharukh's Pyramid.  It's a huge maze!  Just make your way through it.  You can choose to hunt here or hunt in Act IV, either way you will need to hunt.  You want to be at around level 37 or 38 in Haunted Woods, so keep that in mind when you make this decision.  When you get to the last level of the pyramid, you will see Anubits.  He is fought the same way as Gebarn II.  Not to hard.  Proceed to Act IV!<br><br><font color="orange">How long did this Act take you?  Refer to the tables at the beginning of the petpage and compare it to your time.  This will tell you if you need to push the next act.</font>

<font color="pink"><b>  - <font color="lime">Strategy for Act <font color="gold">IV<font color="pink"> -

<br><br><p align="left"><font color="skyblue">You will begin right near Shadow Gulch.  This is the only area where you can buy potions and upgrades until you reach the Brain Tree, which is far ahead.  Head inside the town and talk to potion keeper Shan.  Sell your remaining slowing potions and damage potions from last act and fill your inventory with 20 each of <font color="green">Rot Potions</font> and <font color="green">Vile's Apathy Potions</font>.  Also, purchase some <font color="green">Kougra Sprint Potions</font>, around 10 specifically for The Spider Grundo.  Also stop by Hunsey, the weapon and armor merchant.  If you are still using an item from Act I or Act II, buy the appropriate upgrade as the armor amount will contribute more than a measly talent increase, or the damage will contribute more than a measly talent increase.  When you are ready, head outside of town.<br><br>

If you choose not to hunt inside Zakharukh's Pyramid, hunt now all the way to Von Roo's Castle, or until you are around level 37 and a half.  When you are level 37 and a half, make your way up to the dungeon of Von Roo's Castle.  He should be guarded by Meuka.  When you engage in combat with Meuka, make sure <font color="pink">Group Haste</font> and <font color="pink">Group Shielding</font> is up at all times.  You can use the <font color="green"> Rot Potions</font> on him to do some massive damage.  Keep him slowed with <font color="green"> Vile's Apathy Potions</font> and he should die rather easily.  Talk to Von Roo then touch the orb.  You should be warped back outside his castle.<br><br>

Keep in "Normal" now and make your way across the swamp and into the Cave of Dark Things.  Follow the slime puddles until you approach the Spider Grundo.  It is recommended to fight this boss at level 39.  You should be able to obtain this level through fights traveling to the Spider Grundo, if not, hunt around until you are level 39.  In the fight, he can deal a lot of damage and has the opportunity to attack twice, so make sure <font color="pink">Group Haste</font> and <font color="pink">Group Shielding</font> is up at all times.  Make sure he is slowed at all times!  It is very important to have the <font color="green">Vile Apathy Potion</font> slowing effect on him, or he will slowly wear you out.  He will heal a lot so make sure that you use your <font color="green">Rot Potions</font> to keep up with his damage.  It will resist quite a few, but if it does land it will do about 120 damage.  Use this with Velm or Mipsy when you get the chance.  Rohane is your main damage output so use the <font color="green">Kougra Sprint Potion</font> on him.  Talinia is your secondary slow effect so use a <font color="green">Kougra Sprint Potion</font> on her as well.  It will be a lengthy fight, but he will surely die if you followed the instructions.  When he is dead, make your way out of the cave and into Balthazar's Grove.<br><br>

When you reach the Happy Fun Non-Haunted House, switch to "Hunting" mode and make your way to the top with the Brain Tree.  You will want to be at at least level 42 to fight the Four Faeries.  If you are level 41, they will get first turns and you will fall behind quickly.  Although you have a chance of beating them at level 41, it is not recommended as you will more than likely be wasting your time dying.  If you want to be super safe, fight the Four Faeries at level 43.  Level 42 is the recommended level to fight the Four Faeries, it gives you an even chance to win, though you can still lose.  Just refer to the times table above to determine how much time left you have on this act to determine the level you want to be at to fight the Four Faeries.  If you do not hit level 42 or 43 by the time you reach the Brain Tree, just level up near the last steps leading up to the Brain Tree.  In each fight here, make sure <font color="pink">Group Haste</font> and <font color="pink"> Group Shielding</font> is up at all times, or you have a chance of dying.  When you are ready, talk to the Brain Tree and then talk to Augur Faunt and rest for free and for a checkpoint.  Talk to the Brain Tree, and sell your <font color="green">Kougra Sprint Potions</font> and nothing else.  Instead, buy 20 <font color="green"> Sloth's Sloth Potions</font> and 20 <font color="green">Corrode Potions</font>.  Also, buy at least 10 <font color="green">Eyrie Flight Potions</font> for the Four Faeries fight and the Esophagor fight.  When you are ready, head north and it will warp you back outside.<br><br>

Engage the Four Faeries.  <br><br><font color="orange">This is the order you need to use <font color="green">Sloth's Sloth Potions</font> to slow the Four Faeries to be the most successful:  Earth Faerie, Water Faerie, and Dark Faerie.  You do not need to slow the Fire Faerie, but if you want to be extra safe you can.</font>  <br><br><font color="orange">This is the priority order you need to use to be successful:  Fire Faerie, Dark Faerie, Water Faerie, Earth Faerie. </font><br><br>

Use Talinia's <font color="pink"> Multi-shot </font>ability to do an area of effect slow that will stack on the faeries.  It is mandatory to keep <font color="pink">Group Haste</font> and <font color="pink">Group Shielding</font> at all times or you will lose.  Initially, the faeries will cast their buffs.  You will get a turn where Velm does not have to heal;  this is when you use <font color="green">Eyrie Flight Potion</font> for Velm to make sure he can keep up with healing.  Pay attention to the seconds left for each turn.  If Velm is unable to heal a particular party member, use a potion.  The Fire Faerie is the one you want dead the first, or she will demolish your party with <font color="pink">Astral Maelstrom</font>!  Use <font color="green">Corrode Potions</font> on her with every character with exception to Talinia who needs to use a regular attack to slow.  It will not resist as much and will deal approximately 150 damage and maybe even 190 damage if you are lucky.  She should die fairly quickly, but you still have a possibility to lose here.  Remember to refresh <font color="pink">Group Haste</font>  and your <font color="pink">Group Shielding</font> durations up.  If one of them fall, you will most likely lose.  Make sure Velm is hasted with the <font color="green">Eyrie Flight Potion</font> at all times during this fight.  Also make sure that the faeries are still slowed by <font color="green">Sloth's Sloth Potions</font> at all times, even if there is three, or two left.  Do the same strategy for the Dark Faerie.  When she dies, you will win if you have four left standing.  Save your potions for Esophagor when you reach two faeries left.  If the situation is bad, you can flee and use the <font color="green"> Living Potions</font> from the earlier act to resurrect your party member before engaging again.  When the faeries are dead, switch back to "Normal" and venture forward!<br><br>

Make your way down to Esophagor's Swamp.<br><br><font color="orange">Skip Nox's Fortress.  Hubrid Nox is a complete waste of time.  Getting up 9 levels of the tower is very time consuming, and the fight itself is very time consuming.  It is nearly impossible to lose to Hubrid Nox as he is weak.  But all he does is heal, heal, and heal so it takes approximately 20 minutes to just defeat him.  He is not worth the upgrades.  You will receive better from Esophagor so just skip this boss.</font><br><br>

Take a quick look at your current levels.  You want to be at at least level 44 to fight Esophagor and before going to Act V.  If you are not level 44, switch to "Hunt" in his swamp, and defeat the Slime Titan as first priority in each fight.  In each fight here, keep <font color="pink">Group Haste</font> and <font color="pink">Group Shielding</font> up as first priority before doing damage, or you have a chance of dying.  When you reach the appropriate level, engage Esophagor.<br><br>

Treat Esophagor as if you were fighting the faeries.  <font color="pink">Group Haste</font>, and <font color="pink">Group Shielding</font> as first priority.  Use <font color="green">Sloth's Sloth Potion</font> on Esophagor to keep him slowed at all times.  Also, use <font color="green">Eyrie Flight Potions</font> on Velm to keep up with healing, and on Talinia to keep the consecutive slowing on Esophagor.  He should be able to be defeated easily.  If the situation looks, bad you can actually flee
and resurrect your party members before engaging again.  When he is dead, you are ready to proceed into the final act of NeoQuest II;  Act V!<br><br><font color="orange">How long did this Act take you?  Refer to the tables at the beginning of the petpage and compare it to your time.  This will tell you if you need to push the next act.</font>

<br><br><p align="left"><font color="red">Every fight you encounter within this act will require you to <font color="pink"> Group Haste</font> and <font color="pink">Group Shield</font> or you will die frequently.  I will not tell you to do this for each fight so please keep this in mind when you encounter fights specifically in Act V.</font></p></font><br><br><p align="left"><font color="skyblue">You will start at the top left surrounded by clouds.  Switch to "Hunt" and hunt your way down to the Northern Watchtower.  Rest here for a checkpoint, and go upstairs to talk to potion keeper, Gustano.  Vendor all your previous act's potions and stock up 20 of both <font color="green">Typhoon Potions</font>, and<font color="green"> Slumber Potions</font>.  Buy at least 10 <font color="green"> Speed of Wind Potions</font>.  If you need, buy some <font color="green">Vivifying Potions</font> for backup, just incase.  When you are ready exit the tower to the south.  You want to be at at least level 45 before venturing on, so if you aren't at this level switch back to "Hunting" and hunt until you are level 45.<br><br>

Once you are level 45, switch back to "Normal" and make your way through the maze.  Your path will be blocked by the Fallen Angel.  You do not have to do anything specific with potions but you can if you like, just remember to save some for Devilpuss.  Engage her, and do your inital buffs.  She should die fairly easily.  When she gets out of your path, make your way down into The Underclouds.<br><br>

Take a quick peak at your level.  If you are not level 46, switch to "Hunting" mode and proceed accordingly.  When you are at level 46, switch back to "Normal" mode and venture forth into the next area.  Stay "Normal" mode here to get through the maze.  Be cautious of the encounters you face.  <br><br><font color="orange">If you encounter three faerie renegades in one battle, I would try and flee.  If you feel confident enough that you can beat them, do your initial buffs and hope for the best.  To my knowledge, Kenztahx and I both died to three faerie renegades in one battle due to the fact that they will usually strike a critical hit of 85 damage and have two turns.
<br><br>
If you encounter a fight with a Scorchio Commander involved, he is your first priority on your target list.  He has the <font color="pink">Direct Damage:  Obliterate</font> that will do 100 damage which will hurt your party because of the followed attacks by the enemies.<br><br></font>

When you reach him, fight Devilpuss.  He has a nasty critical hit so make sure Velm's <font color="pink">Group Shielding</font> is up at all times or you will not survive more than one hit.  Do your initial buffs and cast your <font color="green">Slumber Potions</font> on him to slow him down.  Make sure that Velm is hasted with <font color="green">Speed of Wind Potion</font> and he should be dead in no time.  Keep track of your durations on buffs and effects as they will run out in this fight.<br><br>

When Devilpuss is dead, make your way out of the area and into the Village of Cirrus.  Talk to the innkeeper to create a checkpoint.  Talk to the potion master and stock up 20 of each potions:  <font color="green">Hurricane Potions</font>, <font color="green">Speed of Light Potions</font>, and <font color="green">Coma Potions</font>.  Do not vendor the potions you bought back in the Northern Watchtower.  When you are done, head back outside and switch to "Hunting" mode.  Head south back and stay here hunting.  Hunt to level 50!  I am serious, hunt to level 50 here or you will die in Faerie City.  If you are low on time, go at level 49 but it is not recommended.  Level 50 is the exact and perfect level that you will want to be in before heading to Faerie City.  Level to 50, seriously...<br><br>

Once you are level 50, switch back to "Normal" mode and go pass the Village of Cirrus and into the road to Faerie City.  You will notice new monsters named Bionic Cybunny.  These monsters hurt!  Try to attack them first to make them focus so their damage output is reduced.  Target them last when they are focused.  Use the damage potions if you would like to speed things up against them, but do not use to much.  Specifically use <font color="green"> Hurricane Potions</font> as you can restock these later but you cannot restock <font color="green"> Typhoon Potions</font> anymore.<br><br>

When you reach Faerie City, you will encounter new fights with corrupted faeries.  If you encounter a corrupted fire faerie, she should be your first priority!  Everything else should be pretty easy.  Other than that, you will need to fight the Faerie Thief three times.  The first one is in the Inn, the second is in the cellar, and the third is in front of the entrance to Faerie Palace.  When you engage her the first time, do only your initial buffs.  You do not need to use any damaging or slowing potions against her.  When you engage her the second time, do your initial buffs but add a <font color="green">Speed of Light Potion</font> on Velm.  When you engage her the third time, do everything from <font color="green"> Coma Potions</font> to <font color="green"> Hurricane Potions</font>.  When you are done with this area, enter the Faerie Palace.<br><br>


Stay in "Normal" still and make your way across the whole palace until you go upstairs to level 2.  Talk to Vitrini for a free checkpoint.  Also, ask her about the Pant Devils.  Any order to defeat the Pant Devils is fine.  Choose where you want to vanquish the first one.  For the Pant Devil fights, do your initial buffs and use <font color="green">Speed of Wind Potion</font> on Velm for both fights.  You can also use your <font color="green">Hurricane Potions</font> to quickly evaporate them, or you can save them for King Terask I.  You can also use your <font color="green">Coma Potions</font> to slow the Pant Devils to allow more turns, thus more damage output.  When you have defeated the two Pant Devils go back to Vitrini and she will connect the two broken keys and form a key that will grant you access to King Terask I.<br><br>

Head to the southeast, through the door and enter to the bottom right stairs.  Make your way across the separate levels and up to King Terask I, and engage him.  Do your initial buffs and keep him slowed with <font color="green"> Coma Potions</font> at all times.  Keep Velm hasted with <font color="green"> Speed of Light Potion</font> and make sure your durations are refreshed every time.  Velm will get a lot of free turns, this is where you want to use all your <font color="green">Hurricane Potions</font> on him as you will get to restock them before King Terask II.  If Velm is pushed back and interrupted of healing, use potions accordingly.  King Terask shouldn't be hard.  When he is dead, use the orb to get warped out back to the southeast entrance.<br><br>

Make your way across the other side of the map until you are at the southwest entrance.  <br><br><font color="orange">You will encounter new monsters here.  The Dark Overlord should be your priority as he does <font color="pink">Astral Maelstrom</font> to your whole party, followed by Skeith Titans.  </font><br><br>

Make your way up to Faerie Palace Level 4.  You will encounter new monsters here as well.  The Dimensional Faeries you shouldn't worry too much, they will spend more time buffing than damaging, and when they do do damage it won't be that much.  

<font color="orange">The Chaos Nimmos, if you encounter them, should be your first priority to target as they do <font color="pink">Direct Damage:  Obliterate</font>.</font>

<br><br>It is recommended that you switch to "Hunting" here and level up to approximately 57.  If you are level 57, you are guaranteed to defeat King Terask II with ease.  If you are low on time, you can try him at the risky level 55, or even 56.  You will have a high chance on losing based on your luck.  If you want to play safe, get to level 57, then switch back to "Normal.<br><br>

When you are ready, talk to Lyra and restock all your potions that you are missing.  Make sure you have 20 of each:  <font color="green">Hurricane Potions</font>, <font color="green">Speed of Light Potions</font>, and<font color="green">Coma Potions</font>.  Venture forth and go up the stairs into level 5 where Fyora is held.<br><br><font color="orange">  Equip Rohane with <font color="green">Father Sword</font> that I told you to keep from Act I.  When Rohane attacks with his Father Sword, his father's spirit unleashes itself for extra damage against King Terask II.  Please note that this effect does not occur for any boss other than King Terask II.</font><br><br>

Engage King Terask II!  Do your inital buffs.  Use <font color="green">Speed of Light Potions</font> on Rohane for the extra damage output from <font color="green">Father Sword</font>, Velm for healing purposes, and Talinia to keep the <font color="pink">Slowing Strike</font> effect on King Terask II.  Make sure that King Terask II always has a slowing effect potion on him at all times or he can and will disorient one of your party members.  Keep in close track of your buff durations and effects durations.  Also, if the situation is bad for Velm, use healing potions accordingly.  He will resist a lot of <font color="green"> Coma Potions</font> effect, but that is why you have <font color="green">Slumber Potions</font> saved up from the Northern Watchtower.  You will go through all these potions during the fight so go all out!<br><br>

When King Terask II dies, click continue to be rewarded.  Hopefully you get an awesome item for a decent amount of neopoints.  Go back to games, and search NeoQuest II.
