<h1> What is pound_release?</h1>
<img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/ox8tr3dd/1/2.png" class="left"><p> 
The pound was shut down in mid 2007, in order for TNT to do maintenance on it. It was reopened a year later. There are a lot of pets that got stuck in the pound during that time, unable to be adopted by anyone. As the pound was growing closer to reopening, users started noticing that the pets that were previously in the pound were put on special accounts. There are two of these accounts that I know of: breik_u5 and pound_release. These accounts are all owned by TNT. They have been frozen and users cannot view the petlookups of the pets on these accounts. 

<br><br>These accounts were created so that the pound wouldn't be overloaded by the thousands of pets being flooded into it at once. Instead, TNT plans to release these pets very gradually. As far as I know, only the pets on pound_release are being released. Breik_u5 doesn't seem to display any movement. It has been 4 years and it is still nowhere close to being done releasing pets. 
</p> 

<h1> When is pound_release?</h1>
<p>
Pound_release happens a little over every hour. On February 5, 2014 PR was at :54 minutes NST. A few days later PR was at :56 minutes NST. As of March 8, 2014 PR was at :15 minutes NST. Before this, PR happened twice a day. During daylight saving time, which is from the second Sunday of March until the first Sunday of November, pound release occurred from 9:46-9:48 am and pm, NST. In all the other months, pound_release occurred at 8:46-8:48 am and pm, NST. Pets may not be released exact time specified above, so it is much safer to continuously refresh for the pet that you are trying to adopt as fast as you can during pound_release time. Please note that pound_release may go back to the previous times that occured before February, 2014, so that's why this information is still available.
</p>
 

<h1>What type of pets are in pound_release?</h1>
<p>
The pets in pound_release are all pets that were put into the pound before and during the period that the pound was down for maintenance. The vast majority of them are basics and cheaply painted pets. However, there are also some extremely rare and valuable pets on there. The most notable of these are unconverted (UC) pets. These pets still retain the old artwork from before customization and they are desired and hard to obtain. UC pets are not converted when pounded, and thus can be caught from pound_release if someone is dedicated and lucky enough. You can tell if a PR pet is converted or unconverted by typing their name into the Neopets search bar and looking at their picture there. There are also common real name (RN) and real word (RW) pets, expensively painted pets, draiks, and krawks. <br><br>

Pets on frozen or inactive non-TNT accounts do not get put in pound_release. These pets may be purged every 2 to 3 years, which is when an account gets deleted and another user can create the same username and pet names as the purged account. 
</p>

<a name="Search"></a>
 <div class="section">
<h1>How to tell if a pet is in Pound_release</h1>
<p>A Neopet is in pound_release if:<br>
1) Their petlookup says that their owner has been frozen <br>
2) If you go their petpage and hover over the link at the top that says [pets, games, homepages, chat, etc] and you look at the referral URL that it directs you to, the last part should say username=pound_release </p>

<h1>Method One: Existing Lists</h1>
<p>There are many petpages that contain lists of pets in pound_release. Some of them are actively maintained, and some of them are long abandoned. <br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Avarioal">//www.neopets.com/~Avarioal</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Sundrily">//www.neopets.com/~Sundrilyl</a> both are old petpages that have a lot of current and former PR pets. They're not actively maintained but they're very useful for finding markers in order to stalk specific pets. <a href="//www.neopets.com/~zmeevik">//www.neopets.com/~zmeevik</a> contains a fairly complete list of UCs that can be found in PR. 

</p>
<h1>Method Two: Search Engines</h1>
<p> To search for pets that are in pound release using a search engine, 
you would use the same method to search for stuck pets in the pound but search 
with the owner as "pound_release" instead of "none." You can use this method to 
find thousands of pets in pound_release, some of them even being UCs that you 
won't find on any lists. Here is a handy stuck pets guide: <br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~bwoo#b">//www.neopets.com/~bwoo#b</a>. Please note that you are only able to search the <b>petpages</b> of pound_release pets, and not their pet lookups! Also, species like the techo and korbat are unsearchable using this method. <br><br><b>Warning!</b><br>
Someone has alerted me that some of the results that come up from these searches are not within the neopets domain, so they may lead to other people acquiring your account info! Protect your account by changing your information often and hover over all links before clicking them. <br><br></p>
<h1>Method Three: Manual Searches</h1>
<p>This is the most tedious way of searching for pound_release pets, but it is useful for finding markers for the pets that you want to stalk (this point will be further elaborated on). Pets that are in existing lists and viewable through internet searches are all pets that have been found by other people. If you want to find a pet that only you know about, then you can manually search for them. This is done by randomly typing in pet names that may possibly in pound_release. 

</p>
<h1>Method Four: Direct Transfer with Pound_release</h1>
<p>This method lets you see five pets in pound_release everyday. What you do is use the transfer option in the pound and attempt to send one of your pets to pound_release. Then, click the option to exchange your neopet for one of pound_release's neopets. You will only see this option if you have over 1000NPs on hand. You should be able to see the first 5 pets in the pound_release account. Do not go through with the transfer! <br>These pets will almost always be released at the next pound_release time. Occasionally, not all 5 pets are released. </p>

 <a name="Pattern"></a>
 <div class="section">
<h1>Strings</h1>
<p>1) Pets in pound_release are released based on the first <b>two</b> letters of the pets' name. If two pets have the same first two letters (e.g. the pets Amanda and Amy), then they are part of the same string.<br>
2) Pets in the string are released in alphabetical order, according to this pattern: 0-9, then A-Z, then _<br>
3) Multiple strings are released at the same time. </p>

<h1>Understanding the Pattern</h1>
<p> Let's say we have the pets Amanda, Amy, Amicable, Am_, Am1, and Am. They would be released in the following order: Am, Am1, Amanda, Amicable, Amy, and Am_. Pound_release never releases a pet like Amy without releasing a pet like Amanda first. That means that if I want to catch Amy in pound_release, I would follow when all the pets prior to Amy in the string get released and then start stalking Amy. <br><br>

Different strings are released simultaneously, so there could be another string containing Arnold, Arm, Arrow, and Art. It is possible for these pets to be released at the same time as the Amanda/Amy string because they have a different second letter. <br><br>

There is a total of over 60 different strings currently being released. </p>

<h1>Speed of release </h1> 
<p>The speed of release (i.e. how fast each string progresses through the alphabet) depends on how many pets are on the string. For example, it only took a few days for a pet named Requxxxx to be released after a pet named Reqixx was released. Other strings may take months to make the same amount of movement. You can estimate how long it will take a pet to release by following the string and getting a feel for how fast the pets release. The more markers on the string you have, the better you will be able to predict this. When the string reaches a real word or a real name (e.g. Bob), then there are often a lot of pets on the string with that name so it takes longer to get through (e.g. Bob1, Bob5, Bob_the_greatest, etc). </p>
</div>


 <div class="section">
 <a name="Stalk"></a>
<p>Now that you understand the pattern, it's time to apply it! Here are two ways that I suggest you go about this. Feel free to come up with your own, especially if it works better than mine. I'm still a beginner at this myself. ;)</p>
<h1>If you only want a few pets…</h1>
  <p>There's one pet that you simply must have in pound_release, but you don't care for the others at all. Here is how I would approach this situation:<br>
1) Browse existing lists and find pound_release pets with the same first 2 letters as your dream pet, but comes before your dream pet in the alphabet. <br>
2) Manually search for pound_release pets that have the same 3-4 letters as your dream pet's name, but comes before your dream pet in the alphabet. <br>
3) Rank these pets by the order that they will be released, and stalk this string twice a day until it looks like your dream pet is close to releasing<br>
4) Refresh like mad at the pound at PR time twice a day! Don't give up, because that dream pet will be released before you know it. </p>

<h1>If you're crazy and you want ALL of them!</h1>
<p>1) Find as many pound_release pets as you possibly can and write all their names down<br>
2) Group all these pets alphabetically<br>
3) Separate the pets based on the first two letters of the pets' names – each of these groups are a separate string. <br>
4) Stalk the first pet(s) of each string everyday<br>
5) Certain strings are visible in the pound (meaning that they don't get stuck when they are released), so pound surf right after pound_release time to follow the progression of these strings <br>
6) Now you can follow the progression of each string – yippee! <br>
7) Try to grab every nice pet that comes out of there until you run out of room and have to downsize</p>

<h1>If the pets that you're stalking aren't coming out soon</h1>
<p>1) Pound surf at pound_release time. There may be UCs that were previously not on any lists and do not show up on internet searches, and these may be released into the pound. Some of these pets don't show up until hours afterwards, but pound_release time is the time when they will most likely show up to pound surfers. <br>
2) Note down the pet names that show up at the pound when you pound surf during pound_release time. Then, double check whether their names fit the pattern of the strings that you're following. This way, you can track certain strings even without having a lot of markers. <br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~lorrenn#Finding">This guide</a> gives you an idea of which pets released into pound_release will be visible, and which ones will become stuck and not be visible to pound surfers when they release</p>

<h1>An example</h1>
<p>I caught Kanglal the UC dari yurble from PR. I follow the Ka string extensively, both by browsing the pound during PR time and watching my markers. Finally, when the pet Kangix and Kangkix were released, I knew that Kanglal's release was imminent and managed to catch him.

<h1>From the writer of this guide</h1>
<p>As of October 2012, this guide will no longer be supported. Please do not contact Lot's owner with questions about this guide. I, the original writer, have decided to take a likely permanent hiatus from playing this site. The reason for this is that playing this site and stalking PR was turning me into an incredibly greedy, cynical, and selfish person.  It was making me unhappy. I have decided to give Lot to a very good friend since his name holds sentimental value for her and she's always liked him. She has kindly agreed to continue hosting this petpage. <i>Please</i> do not bother or harass her about this. <br><br>

To those of you who extended your hand of friendship to me and stood up for me: Thank you, and I'm sorry for leaving you guys suddenly. You can contact Lot's current owner, Izzy, if you want to get in touch with me. I'm much happier and a better person than when I felt obligated to log in to this site every day. Don't worry about me. I'm perfectly fine. =) Feel free to continue making PR chat boards and sharing this past-time with the rest of Neopia. I'm glad to have met you guys through this guide and I had a lot of fun chatting with all of you. <br><br>

To those of you who hated me and this guide: I'm sorry for all the hurtful things that my friends and I have said towards you. Thank you for showing me that this place is no longer healthy for me. I sincerely wish you guys all the best. If you want to keep in touch with me, you can contact Izzy also. <br><br>

With much fondness,<br>
Cassandra<br><br><i>Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.
