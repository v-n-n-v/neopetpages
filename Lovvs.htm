<a name="2"></a><div class="block"> <h2>General Guidelines</h2>
<b>Please note:</b> These are the general guidelines that each shuffle has. There may be additional rules/guidelines for each specific type of shuffle, so make sure you have read those over before participating! 

<br><br><b>1. We will have a period of time where users can list items/gbcs/customs that will be available to bid on.</b>
<br>If you're interested in listing an <b><i>item</i></b>, post with this format:

<br><br>　　　@yourusername - ITEM (waka value/your value)

<br><br>　　　If you're fine with gbcs, caps, cookies being a part of the bid on your item, post a *cookie* after the value.
<br>　　　Additionally, if you have any notes for your listing (i.e. 1 item only) please include that with your intial 　　　listing.

<br><br>If you're interested in listing a <b><i>custom</i></b>, post with this format:

<br><br>　　　@yourusername - ITEM (waka value/your value) + (your sending box limit)
<br><br>　　　Additionally, if you have any notes for your listing (i.e. 1 item only) please include that with your intial 　　　listing.

<br><br><b>2. Once the listing time has ended, users will have a set period of time to bid on listed items.</b>
<br>If you wish to bid on an item, please use this format:
<br><br>　　　Bidding on: 
<br>　　　@saoirenn - Cherry Blossom Garland (25-30)
<br>　　　Item Name (waka value/your value) @yourusername

<br><br>If you are bidding multiple items, you can use this format as an example:
<br><br>　　　Bidding on: 
<br>　　　@saoirenn - Cherry Blossom Garland (25-30)
<br>　　　Item #1 (waka value/your value) + Item #2 (waka value/your value) OR Item #3 (waka value/your value) 　　　@yourusername

<br><br><b>3. If you are bidding, your bid must come close (within 1-2 depending on listed item's value) to or exceed the value of the item you bid on.</b>
<br>As a general rule, a maximum of 3-4 items may be bid on an item <i>unless specified otherwise by the lister</i>.

<br><br><b>4. Common 2:1 and ~1 items cannot be listed or bid.</b>

<br><br><b>5. You can bid the same item(s) on multiple listings, however, if multiple listers choose the same bid, the bidder can decide which trade to take.</b>

<br><br><b>6. Do not include your tradelist as part of your bid.</b>
<br>Offering your tradelist kind of negates the point of having a shuffle. Think of this as more of an auction than regular trading.  

<br><br><b>7. Once the bidding time has ended, please wait until the host announces that the page is finalized and up-to-date before choosing a bid.</b>
<br>Even if you did not receive any offers, it is still polite to wait until after the host announces the page is updated before you make any final posts.

<br><br><b>8. If you value your items differently than /~Waka, please note your personal valuation in addition to /~Waka's valuation.</b>
<br>This applies to both listed items and items that are bid. 

<br><br><b>9. Failure to follow posting formats or including /~Waka values with your personal value may end in you being asked to repost your listing/bid or your listing/bid not being included if it is in the same minute as listing/bidding end times.</b>
<br>As some shuffles can have a lot of traffic and activity, fixing format and searching /~Waka values to correct your listings/bids can be very time consuming for your host. Each host may have differing viewpoints on how these are handled, so please don't assume that since one host allows something, that another will do the same.

<br><br><b>10. Please pay attention to the opening posts of each shuffle board.</b>
<br>Sometimes hosts may include an item listing limit and these are typically seen within the first two posts of the board. Additionally, this is where you will find the information on what petpage the listings/bids will be hosted on, as well as the times for the shuffle. 

<br><br><b>11. If you are reporting your trades to Waka, Grandpops, or The Community Value Check, please make sure you notate that it was done in a NC shuffle along with whether you felt it was fair or an overoffer.</b>

<br><br><b>12. GBCs/cookies/custom are not valid bids unless specifically stated by the lister that they want it. Please make sure to refrain from offering those unless the lister has stated that they are looking for those sorts of offers.</b>

<br><br><b>13. Once you have submitted a bid on an item, you may only adjust or correct that bid ONE time in the event of an error. Please make sure that the bid(s) you submit the first time are accurate.</b>


</div> 

<a name="4"></a><div class="block"> <h2>Normal Shuffle</h2>
<b>What's different in a normal shuffle?</b>
<br>The biggest difference between a normal shuffle and pass/no-pass is that <b>listers may only pass on their bids if they receive <i>two or less bids</i></b>. 
<br><br>As a lister, if you do not agree with the values of your bids, please speak up before the bidding time has ended to give your bidder an opportunity to make changes to their bid, versus using a disagreement of values to not trade.

<br><br>As you spend real life money on Neocash, we (the hosts) cannot force you to accept a bid, however it is in the spirit of the game to accept, even if it is not a bid you prefer. With that in mind, it is always best to list items you are not overly attached to and wouldn't be upset if you had to accept a trade you didn't like, or stick to bidding where you can better control how your item(s) will be traded.   

<br><br><b>Pros:</b> Can be a great way to trade for items you didn't know about, fun camaraderie on the board, able to pass if your item receives two bids or less.
<br><b>Cons:</b> You may not be happy with your offers and would still need to accept one if you received more than two bids on your items.</div> 

<a name="5"></a><div class="block"> <h2>Pass Shuffle</h2>
<b>What's different in a pass shuffle?</b>
<br>The big difference is that a <b>lister may pass on any and all bids, <i>regardless of how many there are</i></b>. Additionally, it is typical to see a <b><i>two to three</i> item listing limit</b> in these shuffles. Even in a slower pass shuffle, there are typically 75+ listings, so the listing limits are in place so the host is able to keep up with listings/bids. 

<br><br>It is not out of the ordinary for few bids to get accepted during these shuffles. However, sometimes if a lister passes on all bids, they may link their wishlist where you could neomail them after the shuffle to potentially work out a trade.

<br><br><b>Pros:</b> Quick paced, high valued/htf items are typically listed, high energy/excitement, and able to pass on all bids.
<br><b>Cons:</b> All bids can be passed, quick paced, and typically not as many trades happen.</div> 

<a name="6"></a><div class="block"> <h2>No Pass Shuffle</h2>
<b>What's different in a no pass shuffle?</b> 
<br>The biggest difference in a no pass shuffle is that <b>listers will need to accept a bid <i>unless their item has received zero bids.</i></b>

<br><br>As a lister, if you do not agree with the values of your bids, please speak up before the bidding time has ended to give your bidder an opportunity to make changes to their bid, versus using a disagreement of values to not trade. 

<br><br>As you spend real life money on Neocash, we (the hosts) cannot force you to accept a bid, however it is in the spirit of the game to accept, even if it is not a bid you prefer. With that in mind, it is always best to list items you are not overly attached to and wouldn't be upset if you had to accept a trade you didn't like, or stick to bidding where you can better control how your item(s) will be traded.   
 
<br><br><b>Pros:</b> Can be great to trade off items you have no attachment to, or bid on items that you know will for sure be traded off.
<br><b>Cons:</b> You have to accept a bid, even if you don't like the offers.
</div> 

<a name="3"></a><div class="block"> <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<b>1. Can I bid an item I have listed?</b>
<br>If you do not have a spare, you MAY bid with an item you have listed if you haven't received any bids by the last 5 minutes of the bidding period. Don't forget, you are able to remove/alter a listing as long as it's within the listing period. 

<br><br><b>2. Are we allowed to take down or update our listings/bids?</b>
<br>You are able to remove/alter a listed item as long as it's within the listing period still. The same goes for bids as they can be removed/altered during bidding time only. <br><b><i>If you are altering a bid</i> please make sure to repost <i>the entire bid</i></b> so that your host can easily copy/paste your new offer. Additionally, please be mindful of how many times you are asking to update your listing/bid. While there is no set limit, editing the same bid 3+ times in a busy shuffle can sometimes get chaotic for the host.


<br><br><b>3. What happens if a lister/bidder poofs during a shuffle?</b>
<br>Once most users have accepted/passed bids, the host will reach out to any lister who has not appeared on the board to accept/pass their bid. The host will ask the user to either post on the board, or neomail them with their chosen bid so the page can be updated, and if they are accepting the bid, to reach out to the user whose bid they are accepting. If a winning bidder has poofed, either the host or the lister may reach out to them about the shuffle. <b>If you are a lister/bidder and might not be around for the end of the shuffle, please state so in your listing/bids so the host can keep track!</b>

<br><br><b>4. Can anyone start a NC shuffle?</b>
<br>Those that are interested in hosting a shuffle can neomail Lauren (saoirenn). It is preferred that you have participated a few times and I will ask some questions to see if someone would be a good fit for hosting. It is more difficult than it can seem sometimes and shuffles can get pretty fast and hectic very quickly.

<br><br><b>5. Can I have multiple items in a single listing?</b>
<br>We will not allow multiple items to be in a single listing <b>unless</b> it is a complete set that was sold together in the NC mall (i.e. Baby Zomutt Costume Pack, Nutty Superpack, and Maraquan Maiden Superpack).

<br><br><b>6. I have some suggestions for the rules! Can I send them to you?</b>
<br>Yes you can! You can mail me at <a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=saoirenn">saoirenn</a> and I'll get back to you asap.
