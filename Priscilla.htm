Fair.

We both discussed and agreed on the value, ~Waka had the Cardigan at 1~2 but Priscilla had a report of it going for ~3 on 01/2019 and for ~20 at 06/2020. We both agreed the last value was a huge overoffer, and even if it wasn't, the cardigan is getting RR until November 28, so it was going to drop on value anyway. DTI ratios are currently 12 have : 20 want so that means it's not that popular too for a ~20 value. We both valued it at 5 and were happy with the trade.

Thanks for the board and for the effort!"

We discussed values and think it was a fair trade, i used the data i had collected on the Eeri Purple Forest Collectors Background over time.
I also personally value the Lantern higher than 7, more like 8-10. It is hard for people to let go."

Fairness of trade: Unsure? This trade was offered to me - I assume because I was using the grams. By Waka item values, they overoffered."

S: Elegant Ballroom Background (25-30/RR)

My thoughts about fairness: it seems to be an overoffer... I feel like the Pool BG is/was more HTF, is that why I didn't mind overoffering... But I feel the Ballroom BG should be less valued, more like the speculated value of 15-20 (my trader was aware of this value) for the pool BG. The most important factor for me was a RRed:RRed trade

But I feel the Ballroom BG should be less valued

September 23, 2020

Full Set of JubJub Power Bounce Tokens (20)

The trader and I agreed that the trade was fair. I had offered more on my end, but she said she was quite content with what she recieved. The total value of the trade came to ~136-169

The following formula was considered when trying to figure out a value for non-wearables
price on release + years past since retirement
As well as the information known that a full set had previously traded in 2018 for ~125 (am going to be sending in a report for that as well, just second-hand knowledge)

Looking at the past trades on Priscilla I feel like the Garland's value has dropped from the Waka value. So I valued it more around 4?
Either way, I think it was fair even if I overoffered by a bit. I was really searching for the Fog after another trade fell through. (:"

trader was seeking the background, I offered my TL to add onto the trade. We both agree the heart in plain sight is HTF and worth more than 1-2 at the moment. And for the baby rosy cheeks, 4-5 was the value my trader valued it at and I agree that it sounds fair."

I traded my shining princess gloves, (~waka 6-8) for their flower garden arch (~1-2) &amp; Colorful stone bracelet (my personal value being 5).

So I'm not quite sure but this may have been a slight over offer on my part but as long as you don't tell me the gloves are a much higher value than what is listed on waka I'm ok with it because there are almost none of the bracelets to be found for trade. I would definitely class it as hard to find. I mailed just about everyone who has it listed on DTI, the list isn't all that large as many of the people who have it listed are on hiatus. And most of the actives have the bracelet in their closet/not really uft lists.

I just thought I'd share my data since I finally found one! Thanks again for all that you do with helping us keep track of the item values. It would be so much more difficult trading w/o resources like Priscilla."

I valued the blue FoF at 3 (even with Waka saying 2~3) because I had traded for it at this value. The other part valued the BG at 3 because it's mostly on other people's HTPW/Highlights I guess(?)

Note: Overoffer
I listed items I had from my trader's wishlist, basically leaving it up to them to make a selection. They answered with these items and added I 100% totally understand if you don't want to overoffer. It's just htpw for me and I turned down an offer of 8gbcs yesterday so I'm not sure if I agree with the value currently listed. Anywho, let me know, or if you have a counteroffer! I answered saying I also disagree with the value currently listed for the bouquet and it sounds fair to me ^_^..

I am reporting this as an overoffer because the Pretty Dandelion Bouquet has been consistently trading @~4 (see /~Priscilla + listed @~4-5 @/~Waka) for a while, moreover my trader did mention the word overoffer in her neomail, but I personally believe that the trade was fair and had I been the one trading my Pretty Dandelion Bouquet away (if I had one before) I would not have accepted anything below 6-8."

I had originally offered on her plushie at the Waka 4 cap value because it wasn't on Madiegh but my trader valued hers at 10 because that's what she had traded for the plushie, and at the time that she traded for the plushie she made a VC board and bumped for a while and got a report at 8-10 as well. Preivously I had offered on another one at the Waka 4 cap value and the person rejected me telling me that their friends had traded for two at 15 cap value. From talking to my trader from today about the plushie, 15 is probably anoveroffer but considering how rare the plushie is and looking at previous trade data, 10 is probably more accurate thanks!

"(c)

I say 10-12 for the tree because it was listed @5-7 on /~Korolie in January 2018 (I still have the data saved on my computer), while the Branch of Singing Weewoos Garland was listed @10-12. Weewoos are more popular but they have also been rr'ed twice. Weewoos are now @15 so I thought that valuing and reporting the Large Cherry Blossom Tree @10-12 to be fair (+5 values like the Weewoos)."

Since I traded for the plushie at 3 value and traded for the diamond party shoes at that value I put the shoes at 3! my trader said that she doesn't care about the value of the diamond party shoes as long as she got her wish, I don't know if you can remember but I did a VC for diamond party shoes and alot of people said they valued theirs at 5-6, while my trader didn't care so I report this at 3!

On May 27 I traded Closed Eye contacts for a 4050, 17 box custom from themall.

Thanks for your guild, very helpful!

I usually ask for a custom and keep the box number under the cap value...in this case..10 caps/ 2000 nc is what I've been trading that bg for. I asked for a 10 box/1800nc custom.. If I was just seeking the sp I'd likely value it at 4-5, given the box count.

Few minutes ago I traded pink daisy parasol for maraquan SP
+ 5pk shen. (I added a gbc to lessen the box load) thanks

All items were sent on my trader's WL, the dew drop garland was the highest wish which he was only willing to trade the darkness attacks for. I asked him to pick other items to add onto the trade so that it was fair. valued the Velvet Dress a little higher as it's pretty HTF atm.

S: Black and Blue Crochet Shirt (5)
R: 4x 250NC custom (AC rr caps)

Earlier this year, around march, I traded the shirt with someone for around ~5 caps as well. They said they had a hard time finding the item UFT and no one answered their value checks. So they though it was a HTF item and valued it at ~5.
I forgot to report that trade, but based on that, I feel like ~5 is fair.

(cont) Also, trader was fine with the ~5 cap value I proposed initially.
~waka has no value data on the shirt and ~priscilla has no trade reports, but I feel like ~5 was fair for both parts!

last trade to report;

6/10
S: 6 RR caps
R: Ivory Tea Dress (?)
Fair! No value listed on waka."

"Also an item i think should be added;
Wood Planter Fence (1-2)
I was seeking it for a while and found a trade yesterday

S: Spring Greenhouse Background (1-2/2) + Vibrant Marketplace Stall Foreground (1-2/1) + 1 GBC (total 4 value)
R: Wood Planter Fence (1-2/4)
Fair! I over offered in regards to the waka value (1-2 for the fence) but for how long i was seeking it i did not feel it was an over offer!

Thanks for your time!! I'm sure you'll be extra busy with all these RR trades."

Fair?

The last trade for Lucky Knitted Hat and Wig on Priscilla was in February reported as 2-3 but since then when I was searching for the wig I contacted a couple people about the wig who both valued theirs at 5. Ended up trading for my wig in a shuffle for 6 GBCs a few weeks ago and the trader was an experienced NCer happy to trade 1:1 for the wig

Fairness of trade: I over offered. They valued them high as it was and I was pretty desperate for them and this was in a Shuffle. I feel like they are going for 15-20 right now especially with so many people wanting them and over offering for them it jacks up the value. But what do I really know

I have absolutely no idea if this was fair. Probably?
But YOLO I've been wanting this necklace for 10 years.

If it helps, waka values MME16-S2c: Luminescent Tree Foreground at 5-7, you have it listed as 5-10 on Priscilla, and I personally valued it at 9.

I'm super lost as far as current value of the Experimental Monster Chain Necklace, but waka valued it at 5-8.

Almost forgot to report this trade but was checking Priscilla and remembered this was one of the items I needed to report lol. Not quite sure of the value because the BG is pretty hard to find and communicating with some owners, there were people who disagreed with Priscilla and Waka value.

My trader for the other item told me to expect the value to be 10+ for the team sets sails BGs--and TM is the more ETF ones I'd imagine the others may even go for more than 10 caps despite not having a value. Hope this helps future traders with the BG

Sorry if my traders have already reported these. I'm terrible at remembering to report ^^;

Oh the trade for Maraquan Jeweled Foreground is already on the page. My trader was @nandamsqt. We didn't really discuss values so I guess we both valued the items a bit differently  I told her I'd gotten the value of 8 from a VC board I'd seen a few days prior but I haven't actually personally seen any trades above 5-6 so wasn't sure how to report that one.</textarea></center>

Received: 5 GBC + 2 Gothic Charm Sweetheart Gram items (no le)

Notes: They valued their grams 2:1. I was fine with this over offer because the dress is so HTF I was never going to let it go for less. They seemed happy with the trade too."
