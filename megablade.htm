BIG-, BLA-, BOB-, BRA-, BUB-<br>
CHI-, CIN-, CLA-, COC-, CRA-, CUD-, CYP-<br>
DRA-, DUK-<br>
FLO-, FOF-, FRA-, FUL-<br>
GRE-, GUI<br>
JUL- <br>
KIN-, KOK-, KRE-, KUL-, KYL-<br>
LIL-, LLA-, LOC-, LUC-, LYR-<br>
MEE-, MIC-, MOE-, MRM-, MUI-, MYG-<br>
NOP-, NUN-<br>
PIP-, PLU-, POK-, PRE-, PTE-, PUF-<br>
ROB-, RUB-, RYL-<br>
SET-, SHA-, SIL-, SKE-, SLI-, SMI-, SNI-, SOF-, SPA-, SQU-, STA-, SUG-, SWE-, SYO-<br>
TIL-, TOD-, TRA-, TUG-, TWI-, TYL-<br>
__H- <br><br>**note 1: not every name starting with these 3 letters will stick, this is just a guideline. if you aren't sure about a pet name feel free to mail me!**<br><br>**note 2: please keep in mind that pound transferring UC pets may complicate getting a pet back in the event of a trade reversal**<br><br><b>What does all that mean?</b><br><br>Basically, pet names are grouped by the first two letters of the name. We call this a "string." Only certain "strings" of names will stick, and not every name in a given string will. The three letters shown above indicate where in the string the names begin to stick.<br><br>For example, in the SM- start string, a pet named Smalls will not stick and will be visible to pound surfers. A pet named Smock *will* stick, because it meets both parameters: 1) it is in the SM- string, and 2) it comes alphabetically after SMI-<br><br>A pet whose name begins with a 2L combo that isn't on the above list WILL NOT stick, meaning you will not find stuck pets with names starting with E, I, V, X, Z, etc.<br><br>For best results, stay with the "sticky" names, or you will not find many pets in the pound<br>(they will have been scooped up by pound surfers!)<br><br><i>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</i><br><br><b>The Method</b><br><br>Start with a blank spreadsheet in your editor of choice.<br>(I'm using Excel so this guide will be tailored towards that!)<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mRpPcEb.png" width="600" height="375"><br><br>Fill in the sheet exactly as follows:<br>i.e. if there is an equals sign, type the equals sign and everything after it<br>(Note that every column remains static; you will only ever change the B1 cell once your sheet is set up.)<br><br><b>NOTE: if you are using OpenOffice instead of Excel, everywhere I have used a comma, you need to use a semi-colon instead! If you are using OpenOffice and you are having issues with the petpage rejecting your code, it may be because OpenOffice is autocorrecting all your quotation marks from standard to the curly ones. To change this setting you can go to Tools...AutoCorrect Options...Localized Options. You can customize your start and end quotes in that window (Thanks Katy for the tip!). You can also try using a single quotation mark ' instead which seems to work.
</b><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/h6k13ye.png" width="600"><br><br>You should end up with something like this:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Jsq4QCs.png" width="600"><br><br>Now that you have your first row filled in, you want to use the "copy" function to drag each cell down, which will fill in the rest of the column with the same formula. You're going to do this to cells A1, B2, D1, E1, F1, and G1. You can watch me do it in the very slow and funky looking gif below ;-) (ignore the itunes notification, yes I'm listening to Taylor Swift lol)<br><br>Notice that the cursor changes from a white cross to a black cross; the black cross indicates you are in copy mode.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/poSDA19.gif"><br><br>The C column will contain unique name endings - however many you want! Just remember to drag the other columns all the way down to wherever your C column is ending.<br>Some ideas are numbers, endings like -elle -lia -etta etc, or words like baby, cutie, dream<br>Be creative! :)<br><br>Now, the fun starts. In your B1 cell - the only one that you will ever change - you can enter any word or combination of letters and it will fill in all the way down the sheet. Example below:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3TSnaLP.gif"><br><br>
Now, copy the G column, the final one that is 'concatenating' a bunch of the previous columns. You can select the entire column by hovering over the top of it until your cursor turns into a black down arrow. Control+C  to copy.<br><br>Now, you need to paste the code you just copied into an html editor. The easiest way is to use one of your petpages.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bNAvYIZ.png" width="400"><br><br>Take a moment to notice how this method works. The Excel sheet is generating a series of hyperlinked pet images.<br><br>Clicking Preview Changes will start loading the code, showing images of the pet associated with that name. A broken image means the pet does not exist/ the name is untaken.<br><br><b>Make sure you wait until the whole page has loaded.</b><br><br>Any pet who appears unclothed and uncustomised in its image MAY be in the pound.<br>A pet with a background, wig, potato sack, etc is definitely owned &amp; not worth checking.<br><br>Pro tip: On rare occasions you may find that some pets with their basic PB clothes are in the pound. If you want to be thorough you can check Christmas pets with full outfits on; Aishas with collars, Bruces with bows, etc; there is a small chance they may still be in the pound. These pets may have been in the pound when the conversion happened, causing them to appear clothed. If you adopt one of these pets, it will NOT actually have the pb clothes attached.<br><br>Also, if you see this red Acara:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5ZlPbOb.png"><br><br>It appears to be glitched; the pet is usually not an Acara but most often a blue uni, and it may be in the pound despite appearing as the clothed acara. Glitches are fun aren't they? :P<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/pRn2TW6.png" width="600"><br><br>Now, if you see any pets you would like to check, open each one in a new tab.<br>Use control+click or command+click for a shortcut.<br>If you are using a mouse you can click with the mouse's scroll wheel and that opens a link in a new tab too.<br><br>Now that you have 100 tabs open and your computer is huffing and puffing, it's time to see if any of them are actually in the pound! You can quickly go through the tabs using the Control+W shortcut to close each one until you see a pet and not just the red border stating the pet isn't in the pound.<br><br>Did you accidentally close a tab and want to go back to it? Use Control+Shift+T to open the most recently closed tab.<br><br>If you find some stuck pets &amp; you'd like to share, find the Lost &amp; Pound board on the pound chat and let us know who you've found!<br><br>If you have any questions or suggestions please feel free to <a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=lyrielle">send them to me</a> ^__^<br><br></p><BR><BR><BR>
