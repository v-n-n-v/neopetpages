<br>That's the premise behind this page, which was created in 2010. Not everyone is fantastic in the kitchen so these recipes are designed to be <i>super</i> easy to follow so anyone can make them!<a name="nra">

<br>A big thank-you to TNT for helping me update my site in the Site Spotlight. Some of you remember I won it previously but unfortunately lost access to the other account and had to create a new one (fe_chef) in order to keep this going. When I submitted this to the Site Spotlight, I told TNT everything so they had the choice to update the old link, issue a new Site Spotlight or do nothing. This is what they chose to do.

<br><br><b><a name="pitabowl">Bowl of Pita Chips</a></b> <img src="//images.neopets.com/items/alf_bowlof_pitachips.gif" alt="All these pita chips... but wheres the hummus??"><br></p>
 
<ul><li>1 pita of your choice</li>
<li>Drizzle of oil or clarified butter, but not butter, lard, shortening, or olive oil (see note)</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
</ul><p>

Preheat an oven or toaster oven to 200 C (400 degrees F). If the pita has an air pocket, cut or peel apart the two halves. Cut into triangles and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and toss to coat evenly.

<br>Place pita pieces onto a cookie sheet or in a baking dish. Bake 10 to 15 minutes, or until as crispy as you like them. Enjoy on their own or with a dip, such as hummus.

<br><b>note</b>: Butter, lard, vegetable shortening, and olive oil have a "smoke point" under 200 C. While many recipes call for olive oil, it should only be used for heat under 190 C (375 degrees F) or it will start to smoke, which tastes and smells awful.

Stuff olives with cheese. Skewer with a toothpick and put on a plate.
 
<br>Microwave approximately 5-15 seconds in order to get a warm, melty goodness on the cheese. Serve warm.

</ul><p>
 
Heat a pan large enough for your fish steak on medium heat. Melt the butter/margarine, or add the cooking oil. If using cooking oil, wait 3 seconds before adding fish; if using butter/margarine, wait until it is melted before adding fish. Season the fish steak on both sides. Place the fish steak in the pan and cover. Flip fish steak after 4 minutes, then cook for 4 minutes longer. Cut into the middle of the fish to make sure it is cooked completely (if not, cover again, reduce heat, check in 3 minutes). Serve with the wedge of lemon or lime. Makes 1 serving.

<br><br><b><a name="herogyro">Hero Gyro</a></b><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/alf_gyro.gif" alt="This tasty treat is named after the heroes of Altador! Its just a marketing scheme really."><br></p>
 
<ul><li>1 wrap, tortilla or pita per gyro</li>
<li>1/4 to 1/3 cup cooked chicken or vegetarian/vegan substitute</li>
<li>1 tablespoon tzatziki sauce (see note) or plain, unsweetened yogurt (vegan yogurt is fine)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon tomato, diced</li>
<li>1/8 tablespoon each powdered cinnamon, coriander seed, rosemary, and oregano</li>
<li>Leafy green of your choice, 1 large leaf (or more if you like)</li>
</ul><p>
Using a pan or the microwave, heat chicken until warm. Coat with the mixture of cinnamon, coriander seed, rosemary, and oregano. Taste it and adjust to your liking. <br>
In the middle of your wrap/tortilla/pita, add the leafy green, chicken, tomato, and sauce/yogurt. Wrap and enjoy!
<br><br><b>NOTE</b>: Many shops carry tzatziki sauce. If you can't find it, or you'd like to make your own, take 1 cup of unsweetened, plain Greek-style yogurt and mix it with 1 clove of minced garlic and about 1/4 cup of peeled, diced, drained cuke. Mix well, add in a little vinegar or lemon juice to taste (very little will do), then refrigerate for at least two hours to let the flavours really come together.

<br><br><b><a name="tradgyro">Traditional Altadorian Gyro</a></b><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/alf_gyro_traditional.gif" alt="A delicious gyro with an Altadorian design."><br></p>
 
<ul><li>1 wrap, tortilla or pita per gyro</li>
<li>1/4 to 1/3 cup cooked lamb or beef (vegetarian/vegan substitute okay)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon tzatziki sauce (see note) or plain, unsweetened yogurt (vegan yogurt is fine)</li>
<li>Two pieces of thickly-sliced carrot</li>
<li>1/8 tablespoon each powdered cinnamon, coriander seed, rosemary, and oregano</li>
<li>Leafy green of your choice, 1 large leaf (or more if you like)</li>
<li>1/4 cup onion_  very thinly-sliced</li>
<li>Olive oil (just a drizzle)</li>
<li>Carrot greens or fresh parsely (optional)</li>
</ul><p>
In a nonstick pan on medium-low heat (or a regular pan with a little cooking oil or cooking spray added), add lamb/beef and sliced onions_  Cook until heated through. Remove from heat, add a drizzle of olive oil and coat well. Add the cinnamon, coriander seed, rosemary and oregano mixture, coat well. Add salt and pepper if you like.<br>
On your tortilla/wrap/pita, place your leafy green, carrots, tzatziki or yogurt, and cooked, seasoned meat. Wrap the gyro by folding either end over the middle (see picture). If using a stick of fresh parsely or carrot greens, wrap around the gyro to match the picture. This is completely edible, healthy and looks nice as well.
<br><br><b>NOTE</b>: Many shops carry tzatziki sauce. If you can't find it, or you'd like to make your own, take 1 cup of unsweetened, plain Greek-style yogurt and mix it with 1 clove of minced garlic and about 1/4 cup of peeled, diced, drained cuke.

Preheat oven to 205 degrees C (400 degrees F). Do a blind bake for the pie crust (no filling, poke the pie crust a few times with a fork and bake the pie crust alone for 5-10 minutes) to prevent it from becoming soggy.
 
<br>Carefully remove the hot pie crust from the oven and fill with cherry pie filling. Top with the upper portion of the crust. Return to oven and bake for about 40-50 minutes. Remove from heat, turn off oven and let the pie cool for 10-15 minutes. Cut and serve.

While the recipe looks like it just calls for crust and chocolate drops, I wanted to add something to help with the flavor.
 
<ul><li>1 pie crust with top portion (store-bought or homemade)</li>
 
<li>Enough candy-coated chocolate candies to fill the pie crust (varies depending on size of crust and size of candies)</li>
 
<li>Enough cream cheese (or vegan cream cheese) to coat the candies. Try a 1:1 ratio (1 cup candies for every 1 cup of cream cheese)</li>
 
</ul><p>
 
Preheat oven to 175 degrees C (350 degrees F). Combine cream cheese and candies. Fill pie crust and add its top crust, ensuring there are holes or slits in the crust to allow steam out during baking. Bake 25-35 minutes.

<ul><li>Sugar cookie/biscuit dough (premade and purchased from a store or homemade)</li>
 
<li>Small handful of flour OR nonstick surface OR nonstick cooking spray OR butter/margarine/oil</li>
 
<li>Store-bought or homemade white icing, approximately 1/2 cup</li>
 
<li>Food colouring powder or gel (blue and red); if you must, use liquid food colouring</li>
 
<li>Flavouring extracts...optional but definitely fun (try raspberry or cinnamon for the red and blackberry or blueberry for the blue...or just do whatever you like! Me personally, I would use lemon for one and coconut for the other!)
 
</li>
 
</ul><p>
 
Preheat the oven according to the cookie/biscuit dough directions. Roll out dough on a clean surface that is nonstick or has been lightly floured OR sprayed with the nonstick cooking spray OR lightly buttered/oiled/margarined. Cut out cookie shapes to make them look like the paintbrushes pictured above. Place on a nonstick baking sheet (or baking sheet that has been lightly sprayed with nonstick cooking spray or lightly buttered/oiled/margarined) and cook according to the dough's directions.
 
<br>While cookies/biscuits are baking, split the icing into two parts (about 1/4 cup each) and place in separate containers. One will be for the blue food colouring, the other for the red. No matter what type of food colouring you're using (powder, liquid, gel), add in just a little bit at a time and mix thoroughly. If you want more intense colour, keep adding in a little and stirring completely until you get the colour you like. If using flavouring extracts, do the same procedure: add in a few drops, mix, taste and repeat until you get the flavor you like.
 
<br>Once cookies/biscuits are done baking, remove from oven and let cool completely. Once cooled, add your coloured icing (as much as you'd like). In an airtight container, these treats will last about a week or two...if you can wait that long to eat them!

<a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=14">The Chocolate Factory</a> is really a misnomer because the shop doesn't exclusively sell chocolate. In fact, Neopia's delicious candies are found here. The shop also hosts a Chocolate Ball every September 15th and also earns you an avatar if you're lucky enough to buy a gourmet item there. Candy making is an incredibly scientific process that one must do at high heat, usually requiring special equipment and plenty of space for cooling of candies and the rolling/stretching of candies. Because of potentially painful accidents and the fact that most of us are not trained in the art of candy making, the recipes here will be simple ones that involve pre-made candies. Whenever easily possible, there will be actual recipes.
 
<br><b>Currently, there are recipes for...</b>
 
</p>
 
<ul><li><a href="#chilchoc">Chilli Chocolate</a></li>
<li><a href="#codestonetruffle">Codestone Truffle</a></li>
<li><a href="#dtapple">Deluxe Toffee Apple</a></li>
<li><a href="#fruittapple">Fruitmallow Toffee Apple</a></li>
<li><a href="#heartsbon">Heart Shaped Bon Bons</a></li>
<li><a href="#tofapple">Toffee Apple</a></li>
 
</ul><br><br><b><a name="chilchoc">Chilli Chocolate</a></b> <img src="//images.neopets.com/items/can_chili_chocolate.gif" alt="Gives new meaning to the term - Hot Chocolate!"><br>
For those who don't know, chocolate was originally consumed with hot chilli peppers. Enjoy chocolate the truly old-fashioned way with this super simple recipe.
<br><ul><li>Chocolate bar (broken into pieces) or chocolate chips of your choice</li>
<li>Red pepper flakes, about 1 teaspoon per 1 cup of chocolate (if you have trouble with spicy food, use 1/2 a teaspoon or even 1/4 a teaspoon)</li>
<li>Cinnamon, about 1/2 teaspoon per 1 cup of chocolate</li>
</ul><p>
Melt chocolate by placing in a pan on low heat and stirring constantly OR by placing in a microwave-safe bowl and microwaving for 15 seconds at a time, stirring after each microwaving session. When melted, stir in the red pepper flakes and cinnamon.
 
<br>To form new chocolate, either pour melted chocolate into moulds or cover a flat surface (such as a baking sheet or plate) with wax paper or aluminum foil (if you have neither, a little oil will work to prevent sticking) and carefully spoon out the chocolate into circles.
 
<br>Move the chocolate circles (or chocolate mould) into your refrigerator or freezer and let set, which takes about 10 minutes (you can leave them in there longer if you wish). Enjoy this spicy, chocolaty treat!

<br><br><b><a name="codestonetruffle">Codestone Truffle</a></b> <img src="//images.neopets.com/items/can_chocolate_codestone.gif" alt="This rather spectacular chocolate was unveiled at the Annual Chocolate Ball in Year 7."><br></p>
<ul><li>Premade chocolate truffles, semi-flat to look like the picture, OR homemade truffles (see below)</li>
<li>Red gel icing (flavoured or unflavoured)</li>
<li>White chocolate baking chocolate or white candy melts</li>
</ul><p>
Set out truffles in a row on wax paper, foil or parchment paper. Melt white chocolate or white candy melts by placing in a pan on low heat and stirring constantly OR by placing in a microwave-safe bowl and microwaving for 15 seconds at a time, stirring after each microwaving session. Once white chocolate/melts are melted, use a spoon, toothpick or chopstick to drizzle it across the truffles (see above picture for reference). Wait until the white chocolate/melts hardens (you can put these in the refrigerator to speed up the process). Once set, use the red gel icing to create codestone insignia (get creative and use different codestone insignia, not just the one in the picture). The gel will slightly harden. Once you make the truffles, you can place them in an airtight container and they'll keep for a couple weeks. If it's a warmer season, keep these in the refrigerator.
<br><b>Homemade truffles</b> are easy and just take a few steps more. Without getting a bunch of heavy cream and boiling and resting involved, take your favourite raw or roasted unsalted (or salted...it doesn't really affect the flavour) nuts and add to a food processor (I like cashews, but you can use any nut you like...or a mix of nuts if you want to try that). Add in just a little bit of water and turn on the food processor. Keep adding water until the nuts are blended and creamy. Turn off the food processor and roll this nut butter into small, bite-sized spheres and set aside to harden slightly (place in refrigerator if you want to speed this up). While waiting for nut spheres to harden, melt milk chocolate or dark chocolate using the same method for melting white chocolate listed in the previous paragraph. Once the chocolate is melted, use a spoon to roll the nut spheres to coat with chocolate. Carefully remove them and set them on wax paper, parchment paper or foil. Repeat with the rest of the nut spheres and set them aside until chocolate hardens (again, use the refrigerator if you want to speed this up). Now you have your truffles and you can follow the directions above, starting from the beginning. :)

The description says it's coated with "hundreds and thousands"...for those that aren't familiar with this term, these are "sprinkles" or "jimmies".
<br></p>
<ul><li>1 large, firm red apple</li>
<li>1 popsicle (ice lolly) stick or skewer</li>
<li>4oz of chewy caramel or chewy toffee candies (if you don't know how much 4oz is, just grab a handful and add more later if necessary)</li>
<li>1-2 teaspoons of hundreds and thousands (aka sprinkles/jimmies) or other small candy pieces.
</li>
</ul><p>
 
<br>Place wax paper on a plate. If you don't have wax paper, you can just use the plate (any material except paper).
<br>Melt caramels/toffees in the microwave by placing the caramel/toffee, unwrapped, in a microwave safe bowl with 1-2 teaspoons of water. Microwave on high for 30 seconds, stir and repeat until melted...stir until smooth. You may also do this on low heat in a pot on the stove.
<br>Wash and dry your apple well. Remove the apple stem (if there is one) and insert the stick/skewer into the small hole where the stem was. Push it in until it's about halfway through the apple (if you accidentally push through the apple, there's no problem).
<br>Coat the apple in the melted caramel/toffee. You may roll this or spoon it onto the apple...whatever is easiest for you.
<br> Place the completed apple on your oiled surface and sprinkle on your hundreds and thousands (aka sprinkles/jimmies). Move the apple (on its oiled surface) to the refrigerator and let set. Before eating, remove it from the refrigerator and let it sit for up to five minutes to make it easier to eat.

Milk is heavier than tea or coffee, which means that if you pour the milk first then the tea/coffee will float atop. While that's cool, you may wish to mix the two. Use the <a href="#lattefoam">latte foam tutorial</a> to get a frothy top to this tasty drink.
<ul><li>1/4 cup milk of your choice (soy milk, rice milk, almond milk, etc.) </li>
<li>Ice</li>
<li>3/4 cup brewed coffee, red tea, green tea or black tea</li>
</ul>
Place ice in a cup or other container and add the brewed coffee/tea so you can cool it down prior to adding it to the milk.
<br>Add milk to a cup or glass, then slowly pour in the coffee/tea. If you wish to make it look more like the picture, add a dollop of whipped cream atop or milk foam if you prefer.
<br>NOTE: if you like sweet drinks, you can add honey, agave nectar or simple syrup as a sweetener. Another option is to mix the hot coffee/tea with sugar or sweetener prior to chilling it by mixing it with ice (it's easier for the sugar/sweetener to mix). For a real treat, replace the milk with condensed milk!

These tasty treats can be purchased in Shenkuu at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=101">Exotic Foods Shop</a>. Shenkuu foods are most similar to Asian foods and include things like sushi (Japanese), kimchee (really written as "kimchi" and is from Korea), satay (Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand), mint rolls (Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand), hot mustard sauce (China) and others. Some of these dishes are found in other countries than are listed, so don't think this is an all-inclusive list!
 
<br><b>Currently, there are recipes for...</b>
</p>
<ul><li><a href="#friedtofu">Fried Tofu</a></li>
<li><a href="#mintrolls">Mint Rolls</a></li>
<li><a href="#pbrp">Pickled Bluchard Root Platter</a></li>
 
</ul><br><br><b><a name="friedtofu">Fried Tofu</a></b> <img src="//images.neopets.com/items/shf_friedtofu.gif" alt="Love the taste of tofu but hate eating healthy? Frying it solves that problem!"><br>
You can marinate this prior to frying if you wish...it's up to you.
<ul><li>Firm or extra-firm tofu block</li>
<li>Cooking oil, such as canola, grpeseed, vegetable/soy...enough to coat the bottom of a pan</li>
<li>A drizzle of sesame oil (optional but <i>good</i>)</li>
 
</ul><p>
You may skip this step but if you have the time, do it. In a sink, place a bowl upside-down. Place the block of tofu on the bowl. Put a bowl (right-side up) or plate on top of the tofu and top with something heavy, like a can or two of any kind of food or a big bottle of liquid. This is to help press extra water out of the tofu. Do this 1-2 hours.
 
<br>Cut the in half with the knife parallel to the cutting surface and sliced in half again with the knife perpendicular to the cutting surface (in order to get small steak-sized portions)...or just cut into cubes.
 
<br>Add oil(s) to a pan and place on medium-high heat. Oil will take about a minute to heat through depending on how much you used. Test the oil by placing a small piece of tofu in the pan. If it starts sizzling within 2 seconds, the oil is ready. Place the tofu in the pan.
 
<br>Cook tofu until golden brown. Flip and cook the other side until golden brown. If using cubes, you should repeat this step until all sides are fried.
 
<br>Serve with your favourite sauce. I like using peanut sauce, sweet chili sauce or a sauce made from soy sauce, green onion slices, ginger (powder or minced), garlic (powder or minced) and a little sesame oil...mix and top with sesame seeds.

<br><br><b><a name="mintrolls">Mint Rolls </a></b> <img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_minty_roll.gif" alt="This will really clear your sinuses!!"><br></p>
<ul><li>Rice paper wrappers (circular or square)</li>
<li>Fresh green of your choice, such as spinach, red leaf lettuce, etc.</li>
<li>Fresh mint leaves (<i>not</i> dried)</li>
<li>Thinly sliced pork and/or cooked shrimp (head, shell, legs and tail removed); if vegetarian or vegan, you may use thinly-sliced extra-firm tofu that has been cooked (grilled, baked or fried) and cooled</li>
<li>Thinly sliced carrots</li>
<li>Thinly sliced cuke</li>
<li>Cooked and drained vermicelli noodles (optional)</li>
<li>Sauce for dipping (sweet chili, peanut, or plum sauces work well)</li>
</ul><p>
The most difficult part of this will be dealing with the wrapper, but once you get the hang of it then you'll make these with no problem. Using warm water, soften the rice wrapper. Once it is softened, gently shake off the excess water and quickly pat dry with a clean paper towel. Because this might sound kind of complicated, I created a quick image to help you. The numbers in the picture correspond to the numbers in the instructions below. 
<br></p>
<center><img src="http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/716/uggf.jpg"></center>
 
<br>1. Spread out on a clean surface. If using square wrappers, place it in a shape like a diamond (one angle pointed towards you).
<br>2. Place some of your greens, two mint leaves, and your protein, veggies and noodles onto the rice paper, a little bit up from the edge closest to you.
<br>3. Grab the edge closest to you and place it over the filling.
<br>4. Gently but firmly roll until halfway up the rice paper wrapper.
<br>5. Fold in the left and right sides.
<br>6. Continue to roll until there is nothing more to roll. The rice paper will stick to itself.
<br>Repeat to make as many rolls as you like. Serve with dipping sauce.

<li>Enough vinegar to cover the radish</li>
<li>A pinch of sugar (optional)</li>
<li>A pinch of crushed red pepper (optional)</li>
</ul><p>
Slice the radish into circles. Place in a bowl. Cover with vinegar. Add sugar and/or crushed red pepper if you like. Cover the bowl and place in the refrigerator for at least 10 minutes. Serve. This will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.

Since I've been a Neopian, there has been a Neopia-wide obsession with Faerieland that I simply never shared. I do, however, enjoy imagining what magical, sometimes-gravity-defying flavours are created in <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=39">Faerie Foods</a>. None of these recipes will be floating, but they will be delicious.
 
<br><b>Currently, there are recipes for...</b>
</p>
 
<ul><li><a href="#cherryfpie">Cherry-Tastic Faerie Pie</a></li>
 
<li><a href="#faeriehamcheese">Ham and Cheese Wingwich</a></li>

</ul><br><br><b><a name="cherryfpie">Cherry-Tastic Pie</a></b> <img src="//images.neopets.com/items/faerie_food_pie.gif" alt="Layers of puff pastry stuffed full of real cherries!"><br>
 
This is a fancier version of the <a href="#cherrypie">Cherry Pie</a>.
 
<ul><li>1 pie crust with top portion (store-bought or homemade)</li>
 
<li>1 can of cherry pie filling (or cherry compote if you want to make it)</li>
 
<li>5-7 black cherries (fresh or frozen [thawed], pits removed), cut in half</li>
 
<li>5-7 red cherries (fresh or frozen [thawed], pits removed), cut in half</li>
 
<li>Sugar, to taste</li>
 
<li>Orange juice, to taste</li>
 
<li>Pinch of cinnamon</li>
 
<li>1 teaspoon flour or corn starch</li>
 
<li>1 egg white (beaten) or 1/4 cup of oil/butter</li>
 
<li>Candied walnuts or regular walnuts, chopped (any other nut may be used...if allergic to nuts try using granola)</li>
 
</ul><p>
 
Preheat oven to 205 degrees C (400 degrees F). Do a blind bake for the pie crust (no filling, poke the pie crust a few times with a fork and bake the pie crust alone for 5-10 minutes) to prevent it from becoming soggy.
 
<br>While crust is baking, combine the cherry pie filling (or compote) with the black and red cherries in a pot on medium low heat. Mix in half a teaspoon of sugar at a time until you find a sweetness you like. Mix in a little orange juice until you find a flavor you like. Add in a pinch of cinnamon.
 
<br>Combine the flour or corn starch with a little warm water until a thin paste is made. Pour into the cherry pot and turn on high heat, stirring constantly. When the mixture boils, turn off the pot and keep stirring for another minute.
 
<br>Carefully remove the hot pie crust from the oven and fill with cherry pie filling. Top with the upper portion of the crust. Using a pastry brush or blotting with a paper towel, coat the top crust with the oil or beaten egg white. Top with the walnuts (or granola).
 
<br>Return pie to oven and bake for about 40-50 minutes. <br>Remove from heat, turn off oven and let the pie cool for 10-15 minutes. Cut and serve.

Not that I need to say so, but make sure the mayonnaise is IN the sandwich, not all over your hands! I recommend adding the salt/pepper/garlic powder to the mayonnaise to prevent it from spilling when you assemble the sandwich. Insert two candles or sparklers and light before serving. Yes, blow them out before eating! They're just for fun :)

<li>4 thick slices of tomato</li>
<li>Fresh lettuce or other leafy green (kale, cilantro/coriander leaves, green cabbage, red leaf lettuce, etc.)</li>
<li>Guacamole, avocado and/or a cooked lentil burger</li>

<li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>

The haunt of newbies and seasoned players alike, <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=1">Neopian Fresh Foods</a> carries a little bit of everything...maybe a lotta bit of everything. It was the first shop in Neopia and carries anything from baby food to burritos, sandwiches to sweet-n-sour, cheesecake to chicken, vegetables of all kinds and meats, too, both mystery and even coming from some Neopets. Drinks, ice cream, rice, ice lollies, borovan. Neopian Fresh Foods even sells food items that look like they belong in different food shops. Some examples are rice and noodle dishes that look like they're from Shenkuu, veggie plates that look more at home in the Healthy Food Shop, cakes and biscuits that look like they're from the Bakery, pizzas and hot dogs...this place has everything!

<br><br><b><a name="aishachoccheese">Aisha Chocolate Cheesecake</a></b> <img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_aisha_chocheesecake.gif" alt="A creamy chocolate cheesecake that will just melt in your Aishas mouth."><br>
 
This is a no-bake recipe to make it even simpler.
 
</p>
<ul><li>Premade pie crust of your choice (for cheesecake, people typically use graham crusts but this is not a requirement...recipe to follow)</li>
<li>200g (about 1 cup or 7oz ) of your favourite cream cheese or vegan/non-dairy cream cheese</li>
<li>152g (about 1 cup) chocolate chips of your choice</li>
<li>150g (about 2 cups) whipped topping of your choice OR make 150g (about 2 cups) of whipped topping by whipping heavy whipping cream (or vegan/non-dairy substitute, such as Mimicreme)</li>
 
<li>White chocolate chips, about 152g (about 1 cup)</li>
 
 
 
</ul><p>
 
Melt chocolate chips (except the white chocolate chips at the end of the recipe) by microwaving in a microwave-safe dish for 15 seconds at a time, mixing after each session, until melted (if you don't want to use a microwave, place chocolate chips in a cooking pot on low heat, stirring constantly, until fully melted).
 
<br>Combine melted chocolate with cream cheese and whip by hand or with a mixer until fully mixed. Add in half of the whipped topping and fold into the cream cheese/chocolate mix with a mixing spoon (folding is easy, you start at the bottom and bring it over the top...look up a video if you need help). When fully mixed, fold in the remaining whipped topping.
 
<br>Pour contents into your pie crust, place in the refrigerator and refrigerate until firm. Remove from refrigerator and cut into serving pieces (about 6 pieces, but you can make them larger or smaller if you wish). Melt white chocolate chips the same way you melted the chocolate chips. Using a spoon, drizzle an A onto each slice to look like the picture. Enjoy!
 
<br><b>To make a graham crust,</b> crush 150g (about 1 and 2/3 of a cup) of grahams or your favourite cookies/biscuits. Mix with 45g (a little over 1/4 cup) butter or butter substitute and 110g (about 1/4 cup) sugar until well combined. Press mixture into a pie pan/tin and place into the refrigerator until firm.

<ul><li>1 large, firm green apple</li>
<li>1 popsicle (ice lolly) stick or skewer</li>
<li>4oz of chewy caramel or chewy toffee candies (if you don't know how much 4oz is, just grab a handful and add more later if necessary)</li>
<li>1-2 teaspoons chopped nuts or rice puff cereal</li>
<li>2 pieces of waffle, waffle cone, sugar cone or chocolate (for the ears)</li>
<li>2 mint leaves with stems (for the Aisha antennae)</li>
</ul><p>
Place wax paper on a plate and coat with a little oil. If you don't have wax paper, you can just use the oil on a plate or in a bowl. Don't dump in a lot of oil...this is just a light coating to make a non-stick surface.
<br> 
Melt caramels/toffees in the microwave by placing the caramel/toffee, unwrapped, in a microwave safe bowl with 1-2 teaspoons of water. Microwave on high for 30 seconds, stir and repeat until melted...stir until smooth. You may also do this on low heat in a pot on the stove.
<br>Wash and dry your apple well. Remove the apple stem (if there is one) and insert the stick/skewer into the small hole where the stem was. Push it in until it's about halfway through the apple (if you accidentally push through the apple, there's no problem).
 
<br>Coat the apple in the melted caramel/toffee. You may roll this or spoon it onto the apple...whatever is easiest for you.
 
<br> Place the completed apple on your oiled surface and sprinkle on your chopped nuts. Arrange the cone/waffle/chocolate to look like ears and top with the mint leaves to look like the Aisha antennae. Move the apple (on its oiled surface) to the refrigerator and let set. Before eating, remove it from the refrigerator and let it sit for up to five minutes to make it easier to eat.

<br><br><b><a name="bargaburger">Barga Burger</a></b> <img src="//images.neopets.com/items/combo_food_2.gif" alt="Tender mystery meat and a good green glob of who knows what."><br></p>

The Barga Burger appears to be made with the Bargasaurus Steak, which is described as a flavor between banana and melon. Let's give this a go.  
 
<ul><li>1 serving of pork steak (such a pork loin) or a white fish filet (with no bones!). You can substitute a veggie burger if you really want to</li>
<li>1/2 very ripe banana, mashed</li>
<li>1/4 cup melon of your choice, mashed</li>
<li>salt and pepper (about 1/2 teaspoon of each)</li>
<li>cooking spray or about 2 teaspoons oil or butter + 1 teaspoon oil/butter</li>
<li>2-3 leaves cilantro, finely chopped</li>
<li>burger bun</li>
<li>mayonnaise (vegan mayo is fine) or hummus (optional)</li>
</ul><p>
Place the 2 teaspoons oil/butter/spray in a pan on medium heat. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt/pepper to your pork/fish/patty, then put the pork steak, fish filet, or veggie burger into the pan. For pork, about 4 minutes on each side should cook it through, but check it with a meat thermometer (160F/71C) or by cutting into the middle a little bit to see if it's still pink. If pink, cook longer. If cooking fish, 3-4 minutes on each side should be enough. If using a veggie burger, check for brownness on each side.
<br> 
While your pork/fish/patty are cooking, get a smaller pan or small pot and add the extra oil/butter on medium heat. Wait about 10 seconds and then add in the banana and melon. Add in the cilantro and you can add a pinch of salt to this as well. Mix thoroughly and cook until heated through.
<br>Get the bottom part of the burger bun and spread the banana-melon on it. Top with your pork/fish/patty. On the top bun, add mayonnaise or hummus. Then put the but on the burger and enjoy.

Spread half a tablespoon on each piece of bread. Thinly slice the hard boiled eggs and layer onto one piece of bread (touching the caviar) and top with the other piece of bread (caviar-side touching the eggs). Enjoy!
<br><b>NOTE:</b> For a vegetarian version of this sandwich, use Vegemite or Marmite in place of caviar. To totally remove all animal by-products, you can use thinly-sliced tofu instead of chicken eggs, though the taste will be a little different.

<br><br><b><a name="cheesesticks">Cheese Sticks</a></b> <img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_mozzarella_sticks.gif" alt="Yum, cheese sticks coated in bread crumbs and deep fried. This dish is served with marinara sauce."><br></p>
 
<ul><li>2-3 sticks of string cheese OR cheese cut from a block to be about the size of your thumb </li>
<li>1 raw egg (if allergic to eggs or you don't have any, you can use some oil instead...see recipe)</li>
<li>Breadcrumbs (store-bought or make your own...recipe to follow)</li>
<li>Enough cooking oil to go halfway up the cheese stick</li>
<li>Spaghetti sauce or other marinara sauce. Pizza sauce is also fine. You can deviate from the description and try others, like ranch dressing, pesto, nacho cheese, ketchup or honey mustard</li>
 
</ul><p> 
Cut string cheese sticks in half. If using block cheese, I already said to cut to thumb size so you should be good. In a small bowl, break the egg and mix it well. Pour some breadcrumbs into a different bowl. Dip the cheese sticks into the beaten egg, then remove from egg (holding the stick over the egg bowl). Let excess drip off, which takes about 1-2 seconds. If using oil, lightly coat the stick in oil. Next, roll the egg-coated (or oil-coated!) cheese stick in the breadcrumbs. Place the coated stick onto a plate. Repeat until all your sticks are coated with egg and breadcrumbs.
 
<br>Place oil in a pan and turn on medium heat. The oil needs to heat up, which should take less than 5 minutes. Test the oil by putting in a couple breadcrumbs; if they sizzle right away, the oil is ready. If they don't start sizzling, wait longer. CAREFULLY place the coated cheese sticks into the oil by laying them GENTLY and AWAY from your body to avoid being splashed with hot oil. Use tongs if you can. Cook until golden brown, turning to ensure even cooking.
 
<br>Remove cheese sticks from oil and place on a plate topped with napkins or paper towels to absorb excess oil. Serve with your favourite sauce.
 
<br><br><b>Homemade breadcrumbs</b> are super easy to make. First, take hard, stale bread (or toast) and place into a plastic sealable bag. Seal the bag and crush bread using your fist, a rolling pin, or anything else you can think of. If you're really weak, try stepping on the bag to crush the bread :) You can also substitute bread with crisp bread, including flavoured crisp breads, which I do recommend.
 
<br>Once you have crushed the bread (or crisp bread), you can leave them as-is or you can add in dried herbs, powdered garlic/onion, some salt and pepper as you like. You can use these breadcrumbs (or crisp bread crumbs) to coat raw chicken prior to cooking.

<br><br><b><a name="cheeseburger">Cheeseburger</a></b> <img src="//images.neopets.com/items/cheeseburger.gif" alt="Mmmm... junk food - yummy!!"><br></p>

This is a very basic burger recipe that I learned from my father. Since it's so easy, most of the other burger recipes on this page will refer to this. You can substitute vegetarian "meat" mince if you can find it. If you can't and you're looking for a veggie burger recipe, check out the <a href="#veggieburger">Vegetarian Cheeseburger</a> recipe.
 
<ul><li>1/2 pound (about 250g) minced meat of your choice (beef is standard, but you can use minced turkey, minced pork, and even veggie mince)</li>
<li>1/2 medium onion_  diced</li>
<li>About 1 teaspoon Worchestershire sauce (you can substitute soy sauce or fish sauce)</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt + 1 teaspoon pepper</li>
<li>burger buns, one bun per patty</li>
<li>two tomato slices per patty (you can remove this if you hate tomatoes)</li>
<li>two medium-sized lettuce leaves per patty</li>
<li>two slices of cheese per patty</li>
<li>burger sauce of your choice, such as mustard, mayonnaise, BBQ sauce, ranch dressing...anything works</li>
</ul><p>
In a bowl, combine meat, onion_  Worchestershire (or soy) sauce, salt, and pepper. Mix very well.
<br>Wash your hands and heat a pan on medium heat. If you are using chicken, turkey, or veggie meat, then add 1 teaspoon of butter or oil (or spray the pan with cooking spray). The fats in beef and pork will prevent the patty from sticking, but low-fat meats and veggie meat needs this extra bit (unless you really trust your non-stick pan). 
<br>Form as many patties as you like (this recipe can be for 2 normal servings, but you can make mini patties or 1 larger patty), but cook one at a time. 
<br>Cook about 4 minutes on each side, checking to prevent burning. If you have a meat thermometer, stick it into the center of the meat (be careful not to touch the pan with the thermometer). For safe meats: beef/pork/lamb/veal = 160F/71C; turkey/chicken = 165F/74C; veggie meat = any temperature, but for warmness hit at least 160F/71C. 
<br>Remove patty from heat and cook any remaining patties. Build your burger how you like and enjoy.

<br><br><b><a name="chixtaq">Chicken Taquitos</a></b> <img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_chicken_taquitos.gif" alt="Its like deliciousness wrapped in a crunchy shell."><br></p>
 
I decided to offer a couple alternatives to this because it will taste just as delicious.
 
<ul><li>1 cooked chicken breast (or vegetarian/vegan chicken breast)</li>
<li>1 jalapeno or other chili pepper, diced (optional)</li>
<li>1 small can green chilies (fire-roasted is best), diced. NOTE: these are not spicy</li>
<li>1 small can of refried beans or refried black beans (optional, but I sure like them). You can also use half the can if you want to make less</li>
<li>1 packet taco seasoning, burrito seasoning or other Mexican seasoning</li>
<li>Corn tortillas (or flour if you prefer...or any kind of tortilla/wrap)</li>
<li>Enough cooking oil to cover rolled taquitos halfway</li>
<li>1 small handful of shredded cheese (try cheddar, pepperjack or monterey jack)</li>
<li>A wedge of fresh lime and side of guacamole, salsa and/or sour cream</li>
 
</ul><p>
 
Shred or dice chicken (or veggie chicken) and place into a bowl. Add shredded cheese, diced jalapeno, and diced green chilies. If using refried beans, add that as well. Mix well. Add in some (NOT all) of the seasoning, mix well, then taste the mixture. If you think it needs more seasoning, add more. Keep doing this until you get it the way you like it. This prevents accidental over-seasoning!
 
<br>Heat tortillas in the microwave for about 5-10 seconds to soften them. You can also do this in a pan if you prefer. They need to be softened or they will break when you try to roll them. Place tortillas on a clean surface. On the edge closest to you, add 1-2 tablespoons of the chicken mixture and roll. Place rolled taquito seam-side down (so it doesn't unroll) on a clean surface or plate. Repeat until you have as many as you'd like to make. NOTE: you can save the filling for later, just put it into a sealed container and place in the refrigerator.
 
<br>Place oil in a pan and turn on medium heat. The oil needs to heat up, which should take less than 5 minutes. Test the oil by putting in a tiny piece of tortilla; if it sizzles right away, the oil is ready. If not, wait longer. CAREFULLY place the taquitos <i>seam-side down</i> into the oil by laying them GENTLY and AWAY from your body to avoid being splashed with hot oil. Use tongs if you can. Cook until golden brown, turning to ensure even cooking.
 
<br>Remove taquitos from oil and place on a plate topped with napkins or paper towels to absorb excess oil. Slice in half if you wish. Serve with lime wedge and guacamole, salsa and/or sour cream.
 
<br><b>Alternative Filling</b>: shred chicken (or veggie chicken) and mix with salsa. Feel free to add cheese, refried beans and/or chilies to this mixture. This is just a super quick way to get some tasty chicken filling.
 
<br><b>Alternative Serving 1</b>: if you're feeling really lazy, heat up some hard taco shells and place the chicken mixture into taco shells. This way, you don't have to heat tortillas, roll them and fry them.
 
<br><b>Alternative Serving 2</b>: even lazier? Just scoop up the chicken mixture with tortilla chips :)

Heat oil in a pan on medium heat. While the pan heats up, break both eggs into a bowl. Add cream cheese or sour cream and beat together to mix well (if using cream cheese, there will be some lumps). Pour mixture into the heated pan and cook until done (omelette-style or scrambled, it's your choice). Eggs will be wetter than usual due to the inclusion of sour cream or cream cheese. Turn heat off. Create the sandwich by placing one piece of bread on a plate and topping it with cheese. Then add the eggs. On the second piece of bread, spread the mayo-mustard mixture and then top the sandwich.

Do not make your cookies too thick (aim for about half the thickness of your finger). Place heart-shaped cookie dough on a non-stick cookie sheet (or cookie sheet lightly rubbed with grease or oil). <i>Carefully</i> insert the popsicle sticks/skewers. Bake cookies according to directions.
 
<br>Remove cookies from oven. While still soft from the oven, insert the blue liquorice to look like Aisha ears. Let cookies cool completely. When cooled, melt chocolate by placing it in a microwave-safe container and microwaving for 15 seconds at a time (stir after each 15 seconds of microwaving) until completely melted. Using a spoon, drizzle chocolate on the top half of the cookie (see picture). Top with chopped nuts. Wait until chocolate hardens (about 10 minutes if you place it in the refrigerator) before adding the bow sticker (or tying a ribbon in a bow around the stick). Enjoy!

<br><br><b><a name="scsandwich">Spotted Cheese Sandwich</a></b><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_sandwich_spotted.gif" alt="Taking the toasted cheese sandwich one step further..."><br></p>
 
<ul><li>2 slices of spiral rye bread
 
</li>
 
<li>2 to 5 slices of your favourite cheese (try combining havarti, cheddar and provolone) + 1 square of cheese. If you're a vegan, you can use Daiya brand, Tofutti brand, Cheesly brand, or Teese brand cheese, since they melt (if you have a favourite brand not listed, use that). Use a vegan cheese block of your choice, like Follow Your Heart, to make the square of cheese.
 
</li>
 
<li>1 toothpick</li>
 
<li>Enough butter or oil to lightly coat bread.</li>
 
</ul><p>
 
Place a pan on the stove and heat on medium heat. You can choose to butter or oil the pan or you can choose to butter/oil the bread. If using the bread, butter/oil one side of the bread, then place cheese or vegan cheese on the NON-buttered/oiled side. Top with the other piece of bread, then butter/oil the exposed side of the bread. Place the assembled sandwich into the pan. If buttering or oiling the pan, just add in about 1 tablespoon of butter or oil. While it's coating the pan, assemble the sandwich by placing the cheese atop one slice of bread and covering it with the other. Place the assembled sandwich into the pan.
 
<br>Cook sandwich until it is golden brown on the side touching the pan, then flip the sandwich carefully. If it falls apart, don't worry...you can quickly reassemble it so all is not lost! If you buttered/oiled the sandwich itself, all you need to do is flip. If you opted to butter/oil the pan, then lift the sandwich using a spatula, add another tablespoon of butter/oil, then flip the sandwich into the melted butter or oil (flip the sandwich so the uncooked side is now touching the pan). Once this side is golden and browned, the cheese should be melted and ready to enjoy. If the cheese is NOT melted completely, lower the heat to medium low and cover the sandwich with another pan or pot or domed pot cover or the cover for your pan and let cook for about 2 minutes.
 
<br>Remove sandwich from heat and transfer it to a chopping board, where you can cut the sandwich in half (I prefer a chopping board, but if you want to cut it on your plate, that's fine as long as you're careful). Place a toothpick in one half of the sandwich and slide the cube of cheese on top of it to look like the above picture. Enjoy your sandwich as-is or with a side of tomato soup!

<br><br><b><a name="veggieburger">Vegetarian Cheeseburger</a></b> <img src="//images.neopets.com/items/veggiecheeseburger.gif" alt="Mmmm... junk food - yummy!!"><br></p>
 
There are so many different ways to make a vegetarian burger...a quick online search will come up with tons of recipes. The problem I find is that they can be a little involved and sometimes require weird/expensive ingredients. I decided to help you out by making a super easy recipe that's based on lentils. Lentils are great because they're super healthy, but also super cheap and can be found all around the world. Lentils grow in bad soil, so even in places facing drought and soil problems, lentils are available. Unlike beans, lentils don't need to be soaked before they are cooked, making them much easier to cook with.
<br><b>Please note</b>: the absolute simplest form of a veggie burger is to grill a portobello mushroom cap (stem removed). Rub with a little olive oil, season how you like, then grill until softened (you can even just microwave it). This makes THE juiciest, heartiest "burger" you can enjoy for the least amount of effort, but I know that not everyone can easily find portobellos at their local store so this is the recipe I'll give. 
<br>If you're looking for a meat-based burger, the basic recipe is <a href="#cheeseburger">the Cheeseburger recipe</a>. 

<ul><li>1/2 cup (100g) dry lentils (you may used canned lentils, but not canned lentil soup)</li> 
<li>1.25 cup (about 300mL) water or veggie broth (if using canned lentils, do not include water)</li> 
<li>1/3 cup (about 45g) breadcrumbs or flour of your choice. Some people use ready-cook oats and process them to make oat flour, you can do that as well</li> 
<li>1/4 cup (40g) chopped onion_  shallot, or scallion </li> 
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li> 
<li>oil (spray oil or pan coating is fine) or butter for pan-frying, about 1 teaspoon per patty</li> 
<li>one slice of cheese per patty (vegan cheese is fine)</li>
<li>one burger bun per patty</li>
<li>one slice of tomato per patty</li>
<li>one medium-sized lettuce leaf per patty</li>
<li>any burger sauces you like, such as mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup, BBQ sauce...really, anything works</li>
</ul><p> 
If using dry lentils, check to see if there are any rocks (if you find them, remove them). Combine with water in a pot and simmer until lentils are very soft. This takes 30-45 minutes depending on the type of lentils you have. You may have to add more water if the lentils start getting dry, so check it every 5 minutes.
<br>Drain any excess water from the cooked (or canned) lentils, then place drained lentils in a large bowl. 
<br>If you like, you can cook the onions before adding them in. If you do this, drizzle a little oil (about 2 teaspoons) OR butter into a pan, then cook the onions on medium heat until they start getting a little clear. Add the onions_ cooked or raw) to the bowl of lentils.
<br>Mash the lentils and onions well. You can use a potato masher or a fork, or smash it with clean hands. 
<br>Start adding in your breadcrumbs or flour. First, only add half, then mix well. Try to form a patty. If the patty is crumbly, add more flour/breadcrumbs. Repeat until you can make a patty that can be flipped easily in a pan.
<br>Salt and pepper to taste. Try adding 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper, mix well, then taste some of the mixture. If you want more of either, add more.
<br>
In a non-stick pan, add the oil or butter on medium heat. Form a patty from the mixture (any size) and put it into the pan. Since everything is cooked, all you're trying to do is get some nice color on the patty and heat it through. Check for how brown you like it, then flip and do the same on the other side (you may need more oil or butter). When it's as browned as you like it, remove it from the pan. If using cheese, put it onto the lentil patty while cooking (AFTER flipping the patty). 
<br>Repeat this until you have used up all the lentil mixture. 
<br>Build your cheeseburger the way you like it! Optional: toast the bun for added texture.

Yes, chocolate can be used in savoury recipes!
 
</p>
 
<ul><li>12 hard taco shells or 12 small tortillas</li>
 
<li>1-2 slices of bacon (or veggie bacon) per taco</li>
 
<li>1 pound (about half a kg) of ground meat (meat mince) or your favourite vegetarian/vegan substitute</li>
 
<li>1 small onion_  diced</li>
 
<li>1-2 tablespoons of cooking oil</li>
 
<li>
 
<b>unsweetened</b> cocoa powder, chili pepper powder, coriander seed powder, salt, pepper to taste (or use cocoa powder + your favorite taco seasoning)
 
</li>
 
<li>sour cream (or your favourite non-dairy version), 1 spoon per taco</li>
 
<li>hot sauce, to taste (optional)</li>
 
</ul><p>In a medium-sized pan on medium heat, add cooking oil, diced onions and ground/mince meat (or meat substitute). If using meat, cook until browned. If using a veggie substitute, cook until heated through and onions are softened. If using hard taco shells, now is the time to heat the taco shells either in a microwave or in the oven (use the directions provided on the taco shell box). Turn off the heat and drain away any fat by <i>carefully</i> tilting the pan to one side and pushing the meat to the raised side of the pan, allowing fat to drip down. Remove with a spoon and place in a cup (NOT plastic or styrofoam), bowl or can for later disposal. Add chili pepper powder, coriander seed powder, salt, pepper (or your favorite taco seasoning) and unsweetened cocoa powder to taste. Set aside and cook the bacon (also on medium heat) until done. Remove the bacon from the pan and set on a plate covered in 1-3 paper towels to help catch excess oil.
 
<br>If using small tortillas instead of hard taco shells, you can warm these in the microwave (about 5-10 seconds per shell) or heat them in a pan on medium-high heat. The goal isn't to cook them (they're already cooked), just to heat it enough so it doesn't break when you bend it. You can place these on a plate and cover with a clean kitchen towel when you finish heating them up.
 
<br>Assemble your taco however you like. I like to first put in the bacon, then the cooked ground/mince meat, then add a spoonful of the sour cream and douse it in hot sauce!

This recipe calls for you to get yourself some roaches. There are edible roaches for sale online_  but if you happen to live in a country where insect-eating is still practiced, you can use fresh roaches (freeze first) or substitute another bug (a plump caterpillar would do quite well). If you aren't able to find insects or simply don't want to use them, alternatives have been provided.
</p>

<ul><li>20-30 roaches (or other insect), raw shrimp (shell and vein removed), raw chicken chunks, or tofu cubes</li>
<li>1 cup plain flour</li> 
<li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li>1/2 cup milk or non-daily milk</li> 
<li>1/2 cup water</li>
<li>oil for frying (NOT olive oil)</li>
<li>1/3 cup mayo of your choice (vegan mayo acceptable)</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon each of the following: pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, sage...or you can use one to two teaspoons of a pre-made seasoning mix of your choice</li>
<li>1 tablespoon candied walnuts, finely chopped</li> 
</ul><p>
In a large pan on medium heat, add enough oil for frying. You don't need to cover the protein chunks completely, just enough oil that it covers half the chunk (then you turn during frying).
<br>In a large bowl, combine flour, making powder, and salt. Mix well. Slowly whisk in the water and milk.
<br>Test the oil. To test, drip a little bit of the batter into the oil (try dipping a fork into the batter, then letting the batter drip off the fork into the oil). If the oil bubbles and the batter rises immediately, the oil is ready for frying. If not, wait a minute and try again. If you keep doing this and the oil STILL isn't bubbling like this, increase the heat <i>slightly</i> and repeat. <b>Never</b> turn your heat on high when frying, you can start a kitchen fire!
<br>
Using a fork, scoop up one protein chunk and drop it into the batter. Coat the chunk with batter, then scoop it out with the fork. Let the extra batter drip off first (that's why you're using a fork instead of a spoon) and then place it into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown on one side, then carefully turn the protein chunk to fry on the other side. When golden brown on this second side, carefully remove from oil and place on a paper towel or newspaper to absorb extra oil.
<br>
If using tofu, skip this step. Carefully (it's still hot!) cut into the middle of the fried protein chunk, cutting it in half completely. Check to see if the protein has cooked through. If using chicken, there should be no pinkness. If using shrimp, it should be all pink. If using insects, it should be fluffy (no oozing liquid). If your protein chunk is not cooked through, you need to cook it longer. Keep testing pieces until you find a good time to cook the protein chunk thoroughly.
<br>Repeat the batter step and add up to six protein chunks into your oil. Fry, turn, fry, remove, and repeat until your protein chunks are all cooked.
<br>In a small bowl or cup, combine mayo and the rest of the seasoning, to include the candied walnuts. Serve this as a dip for the protein chunks and enjoy!

<li>3 cups white or brown rice, cooked according to the package directions</li>
 
<li>1/3 cup rice vinegar</li>
 
<li>1/2 lb <b>sushi-grade</b> tuna, salmon, or other fish cut into long strips. It MUST be "sushi-grade" or it's not safe to eat raw. You can use only vegetables if you prefer.</li>
 
<li>3 carrots, cut into strips</li>
 
<li>1 cuke, cut into strips</li>
 
<li>1 tsp wasabi paste</li>
 
<li>3 tbl soy sauce</li>
 
</ul><p>
 
Combine the rice and rice vinegar (read directions on rice vinegar). Lay a sheet of nori shiny-side-down on a bamboo rolling mat or piece of paper. Spread rice over the entire sheet of nori. Place the strips of fish, cuke, and carrots across the bottom of the nori, on the rice. Using the bamboo mat or paper, roll the nori over itself, rolling away from you. Use the bamboo mat or paper to help squeeze the nori tight, then roll again. Make sure you don't roll your bamboo mat or paper up in your sushi! Just use it to help you tighten the roll. Once done, cut the rolls from end to end to make little circles. Combine the wasabi and soy sauce to make a dipping sauce. This makes a <i>lot</i> of sushi, so if you're just having a few people over, use 1-2 cups of rice instead.
 
<br>To make the sushi cone, make the sushi as directed above, but place the ingredients on the rice on the right side of the nori. Starting with the bottom right corner, roll the sushi towards the upper left corner so it forms a cone. Serve with wasabi and soy sauce.

<b>Hot Dog Notes</b>
<br><br><b>Choosing Your Hot Dog</b>
<br>Unless otherwise specified, each recipe here will start off with any hot dog that you personally like. Please choose a hot dog that fits with your personal preferences, including pork-free or even meat-free. <i>For my personal tastes</i>, it varies depending on the application. As such, I will include my personal recommendation for each recipe but please choose according to your preferences if you have special considerations.
<br><br><b>Choosing the Bun</b>
<br>
The same applies for your choice of hot dog bun. Whether it is animal-product free, gluten-free, whole wheat, or just a slice of bread wrapped around the hot dog, it is your choice. <i>For my personal tastes</i>, it varies depending on the application. As such, I will include my personal recommendation for each recipe but please choose according to your preferences if you have special considerations.
<br><br><b>Cooking Your Hot Dog</b>
<br>
A hot dog is a pre-cooked product, meaning your choice of cooking method is simply to heat it up. You may choose to grill, boil, pan-fry, microwave, or bake your hot dog; it is all your choice. I suppose you could even eat it cold, though I can't imagine it would be very tasty! <i>For my personal tastes</i>, baking the hot dog is usually the easiest. It gets a nice "grilled" texture without needing to use a grill. I understand not everyone has access to an oven or grill, so please cook your hot dog the way you like and can do!

<ul><li>1 bread loaf, unsliced. Preferably, you can find a pre-made but unbaked loaf at the store that requires you to bake it prior to eating.</li>
 
<li>1 handful of hard cheese, such as Parmesean, Romano or Fontina</li>
 
<li>1 handful of a medium-hard cheese, like sharp cheddar, jack cheese, or provolone</li>
 
<li>1-2 handfuls soft cheese, such as mozzarella, brie or a mild cheddar</li>
 
<li>Italian seasoning and garlic/onion powder</li>
 
</ul><p>
 
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (about 175 C). Slice the very top of the bread loaf off and dig out a large hole in the center (don't forget to leave about a finger's width of a bread ring to prevent the cheese from leaking out during the baking). Press Ctrl + F and type in "breadcrumbs" if you want some ideas on what to do with the insides and top you just removed.
 
<br>Dust the inside with the hard cheese. Try your best to get the sides of the bread. Add a small dusting (about 1 teaspoon) of seasoning/powder. Bake for 5-7 minutes.
 
<br>CAREFULLY remove the hot bread from the oven. Fill with your medium-hard cheese and try to get on the sides. Add a small dusting (about 1 teaspoon) of seasoning/powder. Bake 5 minutes.
 
<br>CAREFULLY remove the hot bread from the oven. Fill the rest of the bread with the soft cheese, carefully spilling over the top to create a tasty cheese crust. Add a small dusting (about 1 teaspoon) of seasoning/powder. Bake for 5-10 minutes or until the top is golden brown and bubbly. Remove from oven and turn off the oven.
 
<br>Wait about 3-5 minutes before attempting to eat this, as it will be very hot. Try serving with a marinara for dipping.

<li><a href="#moltsteamroot">Steaming Root Salad</a></li>
 
</ul><b>NOTE 1 - SPICY</b>: Moltaran foods are described as being very hot, temperature-wise and spice-wise. Unlike some companies or recipes that claim something is spicy only to find that it is not, these recipes are made for people who like serious spice. By "serious spice" I'm talking about people who add hot sauce to just about everything, and by "hot sauce" I mean hot sauce made with the hottest chili pepper in the world (bhut/naga jolokia pepper). If you are not one of these people, I highly recommend avoiding these recipes altogether.
 
<br><b>NOTE 2 - TASTY</b>: These recipes are designed not only to be spicy but to be delicious. I am not a believer in making something spicy as a gimmick or spicy for the sake of making it hot or some kind of ridiculous food challenge to eat. The point is to make it delicious and spicy so you can add an extra dimension to your food.
 
 
 
<br><br><b><a name="moltfrosten">Frost Center Molten Enchilada</a></b> <img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mcf_molten_enchilada.gif" alt="The outside is mouth-burning hot, and the inside is tooth-shattering cold!"><br>
 
The key here is hot oil. Don't try to fry this unless your oil is hot!
 
<ul><li>1 medium to large sized flour tortilla</li>
 
<li>Vanilla ice cream</li>
 
<li>Cinnamon</li>
 
<li>Sugar</li>
 
<li>Caramel and/or chocolate sauce</li>
 
<li>Oil for frying, such as vegetable oil or canola oil</li>
 
 
 
</ul><p>Lay the flour tortilla on a clean surface. Add vanilla ice cream on the portion closest to you (about 3-4 large spoonfuls, but you can add more or less depending on spoon/tortilla size). Fold the closest end of the tortilla over the ice cream. Roll tightly halfway up the tortilla. Fold in the left and right sides, then roll the rest of the way up. This is the same way to roll a burrito or egg roll, so if this was confusing please look up how to roll a burrito or egg roll for help.
 
<br>Wrap the ice cream burrito in plastic wrap or foil, or place in a large plastic zipper bag, and put into your freezer. Freeze until frozen solid, about 4 hours or longer.
 
<br>In a large pot or deep fryer appliance, add oil and heat on medium-high heat until oil is hot (if the oil begins to smoke, remove from heat and wait for smoke to stop, then reheat the oil). Remove the vanilla ice cream burrito from the freezer and remove from its wrapping. Using tongs, <i>very carefully</i> test the oil by putting a corner of the burrito in the oil. If it sizzles, it's ready...if it doesn't sizzle, it's not ready (wait and try again in 1 minute). <i>Very carefully</i> place the burrito into the hot oil and fry for up to 8 seconds. <i>You cannot fry this for very long because the ice cream will melt</i>. This is why the oil must be very hot and sizzling when it touches the tortilla.
 
<br>Remove the fried burrito from the hot oil and set onto paper towels to soak up excess oil. Slice the burrito in half and put onto a plate. Spinkle with cinnamon, sugar and caramel or chocolate sauce and enjoy immediately.

<ul><li>1 medium onion_  sliced thickly (about 3-4 slices) </li>
 
<li>4 grpe or cherry tomatoes, or 1 medium tomato cut into quarters</li>
 
<li>3 asparagus spears, woody portion of the stem removed (lightly try to bend the asparagus spear and apply gentle pressure until it snaps, discard the thicker end piece without the asparagus tip)</li>

<li>1-2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
 
<li>1/4 teaspoon each dried rosemary, marjoram and oregano (or 3/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning)</li>

Place under broiler and broil salad for 2-3 minutes or until it starts to brown. Please watch carefully as it can burn quickly!
 
<br>Carefully remove salad from oven and set aside to cool for 5 minutes. Mix oil, vinegar and seasoning in a bowl. Add warm salad to the bowl and toss gently to coat the salad with the vinegar-oil dressing. Serve warm as a side dish to your meal.

<ul><li>1 stick of butter or your favorite butter substitute (you can also use a 1/2 cup, about 113g, of butter or butter substitute from a container) </li>
 
<li>Hot sauce of your choice (about 2 tablespoons)</li>
 
<li>1 red chili pepper, stem removed</li>
 
<li>Plastic wrap or plastic baggie (the baggie is much easier)</li>
 
</ul><p>
 
 
 
<br>In a blender or food processor, combine chili pepper and hot sauce. Blend together. If using a food processor, add butter or butter substitute. If you're using a blender, it may be easier to mash the butter or butter substitute together in a bowl with the chili hot sauce mix.
 
<br>Once butter (or butter substitute) and the chili hot sauce mixture are combined, scoop the mixture onto some plastic wrap near the edge closest to you. Roll the butter mixture in the plastic wrap (similar to sushi), being careful to not squeeze any out of the sides. When it is rolled in the plastic wrap, pinch and twist the ends to make it tight (similar to a long <a href="/">sweetie</a>). Try to form the butter mixture into a bar.
 
<br>If you are using a plastic baggie, place all the butter into the bottom of the baggie and roll to form a log of butter. Seal the baggie.
 
<br>Place in the refrigerator until firm. Enjoy with bread, potatoes or any food that could use a spicy, buttery flavor!

<li>1 onion_   minced</li>
<li>3-4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 egg or equivalent</li>
 
<li>Half a large, sweet pepper of your choice, minced</li>
 
<li>2 peppers of your choice (try habenero), minced*</li>
 
<li>1 slice of bread (diced) OR 3-5 saltines (crushed) OR 1 handful of smaller crisp bread of your choice (crushed...try a cheese crisp bread for some tasty flavor)</li>
 
<li>1/4 teaspoon (about 1 pinch) each of salt, pepper, dried basil, dried oregano, dried parsely and dried marjoram (a big pinch of Italian seasoning can replace the last four seasonings)</li>
 
<li>2-3 tablespoons of cooking oil</li>
 
<li>3 15oz cans of crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce OR the same amount of your favourite marinara (homemade or canned/jarred)</li>
 
<li>Your favourite hot sauce, to taste</li>
 
<li>Chili oil*, to taste (about 1 teaspoon should be good)</li>
 
<li>Onion powder, to taste</li>
 
<li>3 cloves of roasted garlic*</li>
 
<li>1 dash soy sauce (optional)</li>
 
<li>1 pepper of your choice (try jalapeno), minced</li>
 
</ul><p>
 
In a large bowl, combine meat (or meat substitute), minced onion_   minced garlic, egg (or egg equivalent), sweet pepper, minced peppers, bread and seasonings until well-combined. Divide into 8 equal portions and roll each portion into a ball.
 
<br>Add cooking oil to a large pan and gently add each meatball (do not stack). In a bowl, combine tomatoes/tomato sauce/marinara, hot sauce, chili oil, onion powder, roasted garlic, minced pepper and soy sauce. Pour over the meatbolls. Place a lid on the pan and cook on medium low heat until the meatbolls are done (about 20 minutes). Serve with a cool salad or with pasta.
 
 
 
<br><b>Note About Chopping Peppers</b>: If you have never chopped peppers in your home, please wear either plastic gloves or slip your hands into plastic baggies and cut. The oils from the peppers can irritate your skin and, worse, you can forget about it and rub your eye. While none of this is dangerous, it is very annoying.
 
<br><b>Note About Chili Oil</b>: If you don't live in an Asian country, chili oil can be found in Asian markets or the Asian section of your grocery store. If you can't find it or would rather make your own, add several dried, diced chili peppers and/or red pepper flakes to a glass container and fill with sesame and/or olive oil (or your favorite oil). Let sit for a few days before use. This will keep for quite some time and requires no refrigeration.
 
<br><b>Note About Roasted Garlic</b>: Roasting garlic is easy to do. Preheat an oven to 175 C (350 degrees F). Remove loose "paper" from around the garlic bulb. Slice off the tops of the garlic cloves (reserve these) and drizzle cooking oil over the top. Bake about 15-20 minutes or until softened. Remove from oven and wait until cool enough to handle before trying to squeeze the garlic cloves out of their individual sections. Use the removed garlic tips for minced raw garlic.

This description always confused me because it said "nuts" but I always thought it must mean "coconuts", so that's what we're using! As many people do not have access to gooseberries, these will be replaced with both lime and green graps. You may use pineapple for presentation, but due to the flavor combination I chose to use the graps for presentation and pineapple for the blend.

<ul><li>1 long toothpick</li>
<li>3 tablespoons coconut crème (liquid or powder)</li>
<li>1/3 cup frozen or canned pineapple</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon lime juice or one small pinch lime juice powder</li>
<li>3 or 4 green graps</li>
<li>Water and/or coconut water</li>
</ul><p>
Place coconut crème, lime juice, and pineapple into a blender. Add just enough water (or coconut water) to get it to blend into a texture you like. If this is too tart for you, you may add some sweetner. <br>Wash graps and place them on the toothpick.
<br>Pour your blended drink into a cup (bonus points if you use a coconut shell) and place the graps atop for a tasty decoration. Enjoy!

This item is only available if you have a virtual prize code from Neopets: Puzzle Adventure Video Game!"><br></p><ul><li>1 hamburger roll</li>
<li>115g (about 1/4 pound) beef mince or vegetarian/vegan equivalent</li>
<li>1 tablespoon diced onion of your choice</li>
<li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
<li>2 tablespoons minced pineapple</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon ground pepper</li>
<li>1 small pinch of salt (optional)</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper OR hot sauce (use both if you like)</li>
<li>Fresh leafy green of your choice, such as kale, iceberg lettucse, cabbage, red leaf lettuce, etc.</li>
<li>2 green olives with pimento or other filling</li>
<li>3 toothpicks</li>
<li>Mayonnaise or vegan equivalent, about 1 tablespoon</li>
 
</ul><p>
In a bowl, combine beef (or veg-meat), onion_  garlic, pineapple, black pepper, red pepper (and/or hot sauce), and salt. Mix thoroughly and form into a burger patty.
<br>Cook burger patty either on the stove (over medium heat), in an oven or on a grill until it is cooked through. You can also microwave the burger, but it is not recommended as it changes the texture.
<br>Place fully-cooked burger on bun, then top with leafy greens, mayonnaise and the other bun. Using the toothpicks and olives, make it look like a Mystery Island Tiki face as seen in the picture.As the description says, be careful not to poke yourself while eating this burger!
<br><b>Note:</b> You don't <i>need</i> to use mayonnaise on the burger, but aside from teriyaki sauce it's the best-tasting condiment to go with the flavours here. I love mustard, just not on this burger!

Your basic pizza recipe will first start with a pizza crust. Unless otherwise specified, use a store-bought pizza crust of your choice or a recipe for a homemade pizza crust. Please use the cheese or vegan cheese of your choice. If you have no preference, I have provided recommendations to complement each recipe's unique flavor.
 
<br><b>NOTE</b>: if you don't want to (or can't) make a full pizza, you can use a slice of pita bread or regular bread instead of a pizza crust. You may also omit the crust entirely and turn these pizza recipes into pasta dishes by replacing the pizza crust with cooked pasta.

Spread the cream-cheese-jam mixture across the crust (if using an uncooked crust, drop small spoonfuls of it in a uniform fashion to get even coverage). You may top this with an even sprinkling of the strawberries, or reserve them for after cooking if you prefer. Bake according to the crust's directions (15-17 minutes is the standard, but keep an eye on it to prevent the cream cheese from burning). If you chose to reserve the strawberry pieces, add them after you remove the pizza from the oven. Let sit for 3-5 minutes before cutting the pizza and serving.

<li>1 small onion or half a large onion_  chopped</li>
<li>Shredded cheese (try a mix of half mozzarella, half sharp cheddar) or vegan cheese (the amount you need depends on your cheesy preferences and the size of the pizza crust, but for an average-sized pizza about 1-2 cups should be fine)</li>
<li>1-2 jalapenos per cup of cheese, diced small</li>

<li>Small peppers, such as thinly sliced chipotle peppers or halved jalapeno or habenero peppers (optional).
</li>
</ul>
 
Preheat your oven according to the crust's directions. In a blender, puree the drained tomatoes and onion together. Slowly add in taco seasoning, combine and taste. If you like it, stop; if not, add a little more taco seasoning, combine and taste. Repeat until you get a taste you like. This is your pizza sauce.
<br>Spread pizza sauce evenly on your pizza crust. Combine the shredded cheese and diced jalapeno well. Top evenly with shredded cheese/jalapneo mix and crushed tortilla chips. If you are using peppers, place one chipotle slice or halved fresh pepper on each slice of pizza (approximate where your slices will be).
<br>Bake pizza until crust is to your liking and cheese is melted. NOTE: some vegan cheeses do not melt.
<br>When pizza has finished cooking, remove from oven and cut into slices, using the peppers as a guide (if you used peppers).
<br>Halve your fresh tomato and slice it thinly. Place 1-2 tomato slices on each pizza slice.
<br>Top each pizza slice with cilantro (if using cilantro) and a dallop of sour cream. Enjoy!

<ul><li>1 jar grpe leaves</li>
 
<li>1 cup long-grain rice, uncooked</li>
 
<li>1 small onion_   diced</li>
 
<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
 
<li>1/2 cup cooked meat, chopped small (try lamb)</li>
 
<li>Tumeric, ground coriander seed, ground powdered coriander, garlic powder, onion powder, about 1/4 teaspoon each</li>
 
<li>Dash of salt and pepper</li>
 
<li>The juice of two lemons (about 1/4 cup)</li>
 
</ul><p>
 
Combine seasonings, minced garlic, chopped meat, diced onion and uncooked rice in a bowl. Remove one grpe leaf from the jar and shake lightly to remove excess liquid. Lay on a flat surface with the big, round side (the side with the stem...or where the stem used to be) facing you. Place a small amount, about one small spoonful, of rice onto the grpe leaf near the edge of the big, round side near you. Roll the grpe leaf halfway up. Take the left side and fold over to the right, then take the right side and fold over to the left as far as they will go (about mid-roll). Continue rolling the rest of the way up. If this is confusing, go to a place where you can lookup videos and type "How To Roll Stuffed Grpe Leaves" and you'll see it's <i>really</i> easy. Continue until you run out of grpe leaves or filling.
 
<br>In medium-sized cooking pot, carefully lay the stuffed leaves, seam-side down, packing them close to each other so they don't move around during cooking. When the first layer is done, start on the second layer and so on until you have all the stuffed grpe leaves in the cooking pot. Place a heavy bowl on the grpe leaves and fill the cooking pot with water. The bowl is to prevent the grpe leaves from rising with the water. You can also use a small plate (small enough to fit into the cooking pot) with a can of food placed atop for a weight. The water should cover all the grpe leaves. Add in lemon juice and turn to medium-low heat. If it starts boiling, reduce heat to low. Keep an eye on this as you may have to add more water.
 
<br><br>After 45 minutes, the grpe leaves will finish cooking. Remove from heat and CAREFULLY remove the hot grpe leaves from the cooking pot and place in a plate or bowl. Enjoy as is or serve with hummus or a yoghurt sauce for dipping.

<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon each: salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder</li>
<li>500g (about 1 pound) raw shrimp OR 500g tofu (cubed)</li>
<li>5 ounces (about 140g...or about 1-2 cups) frozen mixed vegetables, thawed and drained)
</li><li>Oil or lard for frying (you <i>cannot</i> use olive oil for deep frying!)...for this recipe, 2 cups should do it</li>

</ul><p>In a mixing bowl, mix the egg and milk until mixed thoroughly. 
<br>Add flour, baking soda, and seasonings. Mix until smooth.
<br>Add vegetables and shrimp/tofu. Mix well.
<br>To test whether the oil is ready, dip a fork into some of the batter and drop a little bit of the batter into the oil. If it immediately bubbles up and starts to float, it is ready. If it sinks for more than five seconds, it is not ready. Repeat this step until your oil is hot enough.
<br>Use a tablespoon to scoop up the mixture and drop it carefully into the hot oil. Try frying 1-2 blobs first, cook through, then taste test to make sure the seasoning is right. Add more seasoning if you like.  
<br>Use a wooden skewer, knife, or small fork to gently poke a hole into the middle of the blob to see if it's cooked through (if it comes out clean, it's cooked through). 
<br>Place cooked blobs onto a paper towel to drain.
<br>Repeat the frying step until all the batter has been used. These are good on their own, but you can dip them in soy sauce if you like.

If you want to use a stove, on medium low heat in a heavy pot, stir chocolate until melted completely.
 
<br>In a casserole dish or other shallow baking dish, place a sheet of wax paper or grease the dish. Pour in chocolate. Add chopped dried apples and chopped nuts. Place into a refrigerator to cool completely (this will take a couple hours, but I prefer to do this overnight).
 
<br>Once cooled, remove chocolate-apple-walnut slab and break into pieces. Chocolate bark is supposed to be oddly sized, so you can break however you wish. Serve or wrap in plastic wrap as a gift. Store in a cool area.

Using your pumpkin carving equipment or your kitchen knife, cut a circular hole in the top of each pumpkin to remove the pumpkin seeds inside. NOTE: ensure the hole cut in the larger pumpkin is large enough for the small pumpkin to fit through. Remove seeds but set aside in a bowl so you can make a <a href="#popumpseeds">Pack O Pumpkin Seeds</a> later. Carefully carve the pumpkins to resemble the picture (or try your own style). Place the smaller pumpkin within the larger one and you're done! Try baking the carved pieces to make some of the pumpkin recipes here. If you're displaying your Cannibalistic Pumpkin for less than two days, you can also bake it (though I recommend separating the pumpkins first).

<br><br><b><a name="pppie">Pumpkin Pot Pie</a></b> <img src="//images.neopets.com/items/food_hal_pumpkinpotpie.gif" alt="A big meaty pot pie made almost entirely from pumpkin!"><br></p>
 
<ul><li>1 pie crust with extra sheet dough to cover (buy or make at home. Some premade pie crusts come with an extra bit of dough for the top. Otherwise, use puff pastry dough, rolled biscuit dough (US-style biscuits only; this can be used to make the whole pie crust, top and bottom, and can be homemade or purchased) or unsweetened scone dough (homemade or purchased)).
 
</li>
 
<li>1 small pumpkin OR 1 cup pumpkin puree, plus 2-3 tablespoons pumpkin puree (set aside this 2-3 tablespoon portion)
 
</li>
 
<li>1 can soup/stew of your choice or 1 to 2 cups of homemade soup/stew (any soup/stew will work)
 
</li>
 
<li>1 small handful of flour (for rolling the dough)</li>
 
<li>About 1 tablespoon of oil or melted butter/margarine </li>
 
</ul><p>
 
If using a pumpkin, cut top and remove seeds. Replace top and bake at 175 degrees C (about 350 degrees F) for about 45 minutes or until pumpkin is softened. Remove pumpkin and let cool until it is cool enough to handle.
 
<br>If you really like pumpkin, cut the roasted pumpkin into chunks by removing the skin, slicing the pumpkin into quarters and then cubing the pumpkin into bite-sized chunks. Reserve a small handful of the chunks to puree and set aside.If you don't want chunks of pumpkin, use a cup of pumpkin puree OR blend the roasted pumpkin in a food processor or blender (if blending roasted pumpkin, remember to reserve 2-3 tablespoons of the pumpkin puree on the side). Combine the pumpkin chunks/puree (EXCEPT the 2-3 tablespoons of reserved pumpkin puree) with the soup/stew of your choice.
 
<br>Most pie crusts require something called a "blind bake." If you don't know if your pie crust does, be on the safe side and bake it with nothing in it at about 175 degrees C (about 350 degrees F) for 10 minutes. This helps prevent the bottom from getting soggy. While the crust is doing its blind bake, dust a clean surface with flour. Take 1 tablespoon of the reserved pumpkin puree and blend with the extra dough (the dough being used to top the pie crust) on this floured surface. **IMPORTANT** Pie crusts are tender and flaky by NOT over-kneading the dough. To avoid over-kneading, add the pumpkin puree to the middle of the rolled-out dough, then fold in half, then in half again, and press to incorporate the puree. Then roll the dough, fold in half, in half again and press again. This will help incorporate the pumpkin puree into the dough. If the dough is sticky, add a little flour and don't add in any more pumpkin puree. If dough doesn't seem any different in texture, add in another tablespoon of the reserved puree and repeat. If you think the dough can handle another tablespoon of the puree, add it in. Roll out the dough one last time, trying to get it wide enough to fit over the pie crust.
 
<br>Remove pie crust from oven after its blind bake and and pour in the pumpkin-soup/stew mixture until it just reaches the top. Cover with the rolled out, pumpkin-infused dough and cut off any excess. Either poke through the top with a fork a few times or cut three lines (about 1/2 inch long) into the pie crust (this will let out steam and prevent the filling from bursting through the top layer of dough). Brush the top with the melted butter/margarine or oil. Place the complete pie into the oven (still at 175 degrees C/350 degrees F) and bake until top is golden brown, about 30-45 minutes. **NOTE** Some of the pie filling will probably bubble through the holes/lines and that's fine :)
 
<br>Remove pie from oven, let sit about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

<ul><li>Two pieces of white bread (try sourdough)</li>
 
<li>Guacamole, homemade or store-bought, about 2-3 tablespoons</li>
 
<li>Cooked sausage (veggie sausage is fine), chopped (optional, but good)</li>
 
<li>1 small sprout</li>
 
</ul><p>
 
Cut the bread to match the picture. Mix the guacamole with the sausage (if using sausage) and spread on one piece of bread (one side only). Place the other piece of bread (spread-side down) atop to make the sandwich.
 
<br>You may toast this sandwich on the stove, in a panini press, or in a toaster oven if you like, or you can eat it cold. Alternately, you may toast the bread before adding the guacamole if you prefer. Add the sprout to match the picture and enjoy!

<ul><li>1/2 leek, sliced OR 3 green onions_   sliced
 
</li>
 
<li>1/2 cup kale, chopped
 
</li>
 
<li>1/2 cup spinach (fresh or frozen), chopped
 
</li>
 
<li>1 potato, cut into cubes
 
</li>
 
<li>1/2 cup okra (fresh or frozen), chopped
 
</li>
 
<li>Fresh or dried Italian herbs (parsley, oregano, marjoram, basil...or "Italian Seasoning"), to taste
 
</li>
 
<li>Enough water to cover ingredients
 
</li>
 
<li>Salt, garlic powder and pepper, to taste
 
</li>
 
</ul><p>
 
Combine the leek (or green onions_ , cubed potato and okra in a medium pot on medium heat. Add in enough water to just cover the ingredients. Cook until potatoes are softened. Add in the kale, spinach and herbs, cooking until the kale just starts to wilt (about 4 minutes). Remove soup from heat. In small batches, place soup into a blender or food processor. Blending heated food can create a problem with pressure, so be careful to only blend for about 5 seconds, then open to relieve pressure. If this sounds like too much work, just wait until the soup cools to room temperature and then blend it all. Return now-blended soup to the stove and simmer on low heat, adding in salt, garlic powder and pepper to taste. Serve in a skull-shaped bowl (if you have one). While the okra cooked, it will have made the soup very slimy and the other ingredients have made it very green. The potatoes offers some substance to the dish.

Cut top off of pumpkin and remove seeds (DO NOT follow the picture and cut a face into the pumpkin, this will ruin it). If you like pumpkin seeds, set the seeds aside and make <a href="#popumpseeds">Pack O Pumpkin Seeds</a> later. Replace top and bake at 175 degrees C (about 350 degrees F) for about 30 minutes. Remove pumpkin and let cool until it is cool enough to handle.
 
<br>While pumpkin is baking, prepare <a href="#slimesoup">Slime Soup</a> as directed, stopping directly after pureeing the soup. Taste the soup and season to taste. Pour soup into pumpkin and bake another 15 minutes, or until pumpkin is softened. Remove from oven, let sit for about 5 minutes before serving.

<ul><li>1 cup baking white chocolate in any form (bar, chips, etc.)
 
</li>
 
<li>Green candy-coated chocolate candies of your choice
 
</li>
 
<li>1 baking sheet or foil-covered chopping board (preferably chilled, but not required)
 
</li>
 
</ul><p>
 
First, you must melt the white chocolate. You can melt it on the stove or using the microwave. If using the stove, place the white chocolate in a pot and set to medium low heat, stirring when you start seeing it melt. If using the microwave, place a small handful of the white chocolate into a microwave-safe bowl, heat for 15 seconds, stir, heat for 15 seconds, stir...repeat until chocolate is melted. Once the white chocolate is melted, use a spoon (any is fine) to drizzle ghosts onto the baking sheet or foil-covered chopping board. Place two green candy-coated chocolate candies for eyes. Continue doing this until the white chocolate is used. Place baking sheet or foil-covered chopping board into the freezer or refrigerator to chill the chocolate until hardened.<br>
 
To make thicker ghost candies, when the white chocolate has hardened, add more of the melted white chocolate to it, building up over the set white chocolate, then chill. Keep doing this until you have them as thick as you'd like!

<li>White frosting or whipped creme</li>
<li>Almonds</li>
<li>Candy corn</li>
</ul><p>
 
Preheat oven according to the cookie dough package or your cookie dough recipe. If using your own recipe OR a packaged dough that comes in chunks, roll out cookie dough and cut circles from it. Place these circles atop a baking sheet, then attach little triangles to the top of the cookie to look like owl feathers (see Whoot Cookie picture, above). If using a packaged cookie dough that is designed to have you cut circles off it (the dough is cylindrical and comes in a sausage-style packaging), then cut circles from the cookie dough cylinder and place onto a baking sheet. Reserve some dough to make the little owl feathers. Bake cookies according to recipe or package directions.
 
<br>When cookies are baked, let cool completely. Then, place two small dallops of white frosting or whipped cream where you think the eyes should be. Then set an almond in each dallop, arranging it to look like the Whoot Cookie picture (the almonds should be placed to look like eyes with vertical pupils). Using a little frosting (or whipped cream) as "glue," place some frosting on the back of a piece of candy corn and stick it to the cookie like a beak.
 
<br>If you used whipped creme, these cookies must be stored in the refrigerator. If using frosting only, these cookies can be stores in a sealed container in a cupboard or on the counter.

Fill a cooking pot halfway with water and place the three eggs inside. Heat on high heat, boiling the eggs until cooked, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, wash and dice the sweet pepper and scallion. When the eggs finish boiling, move the cooking pot to your sink and turn on the faucet to run cold water over the eggs. Do this until eggs are cooled. Break eggs and place in a bowl. Mash or crumble the eggs and add sweet pepper and scallion. Add mayonnaise 1 tablespoon at a time and mix thoroughly until you get the texture you desire (similar in texture to paste or thick mud). Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve as a side dish or between bread for an egg salad sandwich.

<br>Slice the top of the sweet pepper to expose the inside as well as to remove the stem. Set aside (don't throw away!). Remove seeds and white "ribs". Cut away the sweet pepper flesh from the stem. Throw away stem and mince sweet pepper. Add this to the rice and cheese mixture. Fill hollowed-out sweet pepper with rice/cheese mixture, place in a baking dish or pie tin (just to prevent it from falling over or oozing into your oven) and bake about 20 minutes or until filling is hot and cheese is melted. For extra fanciness, try topping the filled pepper with more cheese and herbs before putting it in the oven. Enjoy!

<br><br><br><a name="queue"><h3>Recipe Queue</h3></a>
 
Requests are processed in order received but based on how quickly the recipe can be created, with the exception of newsletter subscribers (the starred names). If I happen to get an idea for a recipe spontaneously, that will typically go ahead of the queue. Please note that well-known items, such as faerie bubbles, will take longer to process as they tend to require more kitchen work. For example, some of the salads are a matter of arranging items on a plate, so they're not difficult, but other items that are made with Neopian-only foods require some careful combining of real-world flavors so they need more work in the kitchen. As a result, those recipes take longer to write.
