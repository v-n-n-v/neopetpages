Hello, My name is Guntrad the kiko.  I am 131023 hours old.
I have a fantastic owner called <b><a href='//www.neopets.com/randomfriend.phtml?randomfriend=pet_topia300'>pet_topia300</a></b>, who takes great care of me.  
pet_topia300 is currently training me up for the

 I have only just started and already I am at level 6!

As you may know, all Kikos love water.  We can swim from birth and like nothing better than 
splashing around in the ocean.  A great place to go is the rocky springs.  This is just off the 
coast of Mystery Island.  If you climb onto the rocks and wait patiently a warm jet of water 
will lift you high into the sky!  Its great fun, you ought to try it sometime.

I also love to go to theme parks.  Last summer pet_topia300 took me to this huge water park.  
It had slides, fountains and hundreds of swimming pools.  I went with lots of my friends 
and their owners.  We had a fantastic time and all went for a picnic afterwards.
