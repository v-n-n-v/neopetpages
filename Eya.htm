<h1>Eya's guide to DTI ratios</h1>
<blockquote>
Hello! My name is Eya. It's nice to meet you!
<br><br>
I'm a data-wrangler by day, and a neo-lurker by night. I'm here today to talk about DTI ratios; a subject that, as far as I can tell, has very little guide material available. I want to put this tool in the pockets of less experienced traders—and maybe some of you veterans, too-- in the form of real, usable numbers.
<br><br>
But we'll get to that! First, let's establish a baseline. Starting with…

</blockquote>

<h1>Huh? What's a DTI? And how does it have ratios?</h1>
<blockquote>
DTI, or Dress To Impress, is one of the most commonly used fansites for sorting Neocash tradelists (the other major player being Jellyneo). It is officially approved by neopets.com, meaning you are allowed to freely reference it by name and even link to the website on the neoboards.
<br><br>
There are two different versions of DTI-- an older version, and a newer "beta" version. In both versions, searching for a particular item will display an icon, any flavor text, the spots on your pet that this item occupies/restricts, and, most importantly, two numbers: the number of users who have this item up for trade (Offering), and the number of users who want this item (Seeking).
<br><br>
To calculate the DTI ratio of any item, simply plug in the corresponding numbers to this simple formula: 
<br><b>(Seeking / Offering) × 100 = DTI Ratio</b>
<br>Sample: (10 seeking/60 offering) × 100 = 16%
<br><br>
ALL seeking/offering data provided here was obtained through the NEW DTI BETA site. The beta version of the site filters the data for tradelists and wishlists that were seen active within the last six months, so it provides a much more accurate picture of the current market. 
<br><br><b>For the best results, I recommend using only the beta version of the site when trying to compare numbers to any of this data.</b>


</blockquote>

<h1>So how does knowing these numbers help me?</h1>
<blockquote>
Popular items naturally have more people seeking them. Rare items have less people offering them. Very valuable items are usually a combination of both popular and rare. So, naturally, more experienced traders get a feel for when they should begin charging more for their items.
<br><br>
It's a very nebulous process that requires a lot of trial and error, but eventually the community comes to agree on the value of certain items. These items are collected and displayed, with the best guesstimate of their value, on a current value guide.
<br><br>
For a very long time that guide was hosted on /~Waka, but it was retired, and is now very out-of-date. A new guide took its place, hosted on /~Owls, but this guide decided to go back to the community and generate its own set of values, from scratch. So, while the values are more accurate to the current day market, there are still thousands of NC items that simply haven't seen enough trades reported for Owls to get an accurate picture of what they are worth.
<br><br>
So, what do you do when you have an item that has no easily accessible community generated value available? Well, you cross check with the only reliable set of numbers still available to you, which comes in the form of Seeking/Offering data on DTI. These numbers help provide a starting point for pricing your item, when otherwise you may have been left shooting in the dark.
<br><br>
Being aware of these numbers also helps you spot when other traders are severely overpricing their items-- or undervaluing yours-- so that you can get fairer trades overall.

</blockquote>
<h1>Okay, I understand why it's important; but I still don't understand what the numbers mean.</h1>
<blockquote>
Have no fear! For I have data, and (hopefully) easy to read charts made from that data to show you! In case you were wondering, here's how I made them:
<br><br>
I began by pulling every item with an established value listed on /~Owls. I recorded the seeking/offering numbers of each of these items individually, and then took the average of each data set to create a set of easily readable charts that provides a snapshot of the market.
<br><br>
For this guide, any numbers given are completely objective. While I can't claim it is 100% accurate, I did my best to record only the numbers I saw and include them all in the snapshot-- even the bogus rereleases and horrifically underpriced things. The only edit I chose to make was to remove ALL Dyeworks items across ALL price points from the data. Because this took me several days of manual data entry right after the new DW caps released, I did not want the volatile nature of those re-releases to negatively affect the data. Since this is dealing primarily in large number averages, I didn't believe the DW items were needed in order to get a good snapshot. If there is interest in the future, I may look into adding the DW items back in.
<br><br>
Confusing? Well, try taking a peek at the charts below. Maybe it will make more sense in graphic form!
<br><br>
And before I jump into this, I just want to note—for a value system that is entirely community generated and revolves a lot around whim and luck, these average values are shockingly consistent, with only a few outliers that I'm sure would smooth out if I had access to more data points. I want to applaud the NC boards for always striving to be fair and consistent with their pricing, because if that weren't the case, it's much more likely this data would be a jumbled unreadable mess with no rhyme or reason to it.


</blockquote>
<a name="data"></a>
<h1>Without further ado: the data!</h1>
<blockquote>
<b>This snapshot was taken on Jan. 3, 2022. It uses approx. 830 total data points.</b>
<br><br>
All data is rounded to the nearest whole number. Color differences are just for contrast when lines are overlapping.
<br><br>
To use, find where your item sits value-wise on all three charts. Then decide on a price that you feel marries all three values together.
<br><br>
I personally rank them in order of importance of (1) Ratio, (2) Seeking, and (3) Offering. I personally recommend always starting from the DTI ratio and then adjusting from there; offering numbers are only really important in the context of the other two, and should only result in minor adjustments to price.

<h1>Pricing – caveats &amp; tweaks</h1>
<blockquote>
Have you looked at the charts, and something still doesn't feel quite right? Here are some additional, non-numerical things to consider when tweaking your price range!
<br><br><b>… Check if it's buyable.</b><br>
I know, I know. But some buyables can have some really weird DTI ratios– always make sure you do your research and don't try to ONLY trade based off of DTI ratios. /~Owls is pretty good about keeping buyables labeled as such.

<br><br><b>Is your item hard to find, but not very popular?</b><br>
This method don't work very well for extremely rare, hard to find items, especially ones that aren't terribly sought after. For items like these, always do your best to check other available trade data first. If there is absolutely no data to go off of, don't immediately lump it in with the 30+ range just because there are less than 15 people trading it. Instead, base your value off the ratio and seeking numbers, and then try bumping the value up a tier or two (ie 8-10 instead of 6-8), instead of rocketing it straight to the moon.
<br><br><b>Is your item very pretty? Is it very ugly?</b><br>
Try to be objective for this section, and really take a good look at the art– the real art, and not the icon. Now, be honest– is it kind of ugly? And I don't mean hideous in the way mutants are hideous. There are some items out there with pretty janky, poorly drawn art, or art that just doesn't sit right on many neopet models. Particularly for non-popular, hard to find items, this can be a difference maker when deciding what is fair to charge. I personally give it a -1 price tier if it's just awful, and a +1 if it's outstandingly nice. Do be fair to yourself though; there are some really pretty "non-pops" out there, so don't sell your item short just because it doesn't have super high seeking numbers.
<br><br><b>Is your item influential? Can it make or break a custom?</b><br>
Once you break the 10+ value barrier, an enormously large chunk of items found there are major custom-defining items such as foregrounds, backgrounds, headpieces (hats, wigs, etc.), held items, dresses, makeup, and special effects. These items can change the entire look and feel of a custom, and are often not easy to replace for people trying to achieve a specific look.
<br><br>
Conversely, there are proportionally very few shoes, gloves, pants, small jewelry, and small foreground trinkets in the upper price tiers. Before pricing an item very highly, ask yourself if people will really want to fork over that price point for an ankle bracelet– or if they'll just leave and find a similar replacement.

</blockquote>


<h1>WARNING: Ratio manipulation/inflation</h1>
<blockquote>
Unfortunately, I have received reports of there being an influx of fake DTI accounts lately. It's pretty safe to assume that the purpose of these accounts is to artificially inflate the seeking/offering numbers of items. <br><br><b>If this is you, you should be ashamed of yourself. You are the reason we can't have nice things. <br></b><br>
To protect yourself from this, there are a couple things to keep in mind:

<br><br><b>Manipulators can only take numbers up, not down.</b><br>
If an item has only 8 people offering or only 2 people seeking, those are probably pretty accurate. DTI accounts can be added easily, but these scammers cannot take other people's accounts away.

<br><br><b>Watch for suspicious fluctuations</b><br>
If an item you know had only 10 copies on the market one day suddenly has 20 copies the next day, with no RR in sight, perhaps avoid using the ratio to evaluate the correct price for that item. 

<br><br><b>Beware of anyone being too insistent about DTI ratios</b><br>
While DTI ratios are a helpful tool for evaluating general trends, if anyone INSISTS that their item MUST be worth XYZ because DTI says so, take caution. 

<br><br><b>Community values should be your baseline whenever possible.</b><br>
Community generated values are much less susceptible to this sort of instant manipulation. If a ratio differs greatly from the community value available on /~Owls, check to see if there is a good reason for it, such as being RRed recently. If there doesn't seem to be any clear reason for the change, proceed using caution.

<br><br><b>Rebalancing the data</b><br>
I do plan on re-running and updating these numbers every so often. If this is a persistent problem, re-running the numbers should help, as all of the numbers will self-adjust to account for this type of inflation.

</blockquote>

<h1>Time for musings</h1>
<blockquote>
If all you wanted was the raw data, feel free to grab those charts and run! In the following sections, I'm going to talk about each value set in a bit more detail and discuss a few of the irregularities. This will all be based off of my own thoughts and observations from this process, so feel free to skip it if you don't feel like you need a deep dive.


</blockquote>

<h1>1-2: Humble beginnings (262 entries)</h1>
<blockquote>
Ah, 1-2. The great fallback zone. The price we price everything at—until we don't.
<br><br>
Unsurprisingly, of the ~800 or so data points, there were by far the most items in this category. And let me tell you, there was a LOT of junk in here. Plenty of ratios at less than 1%, which ultimately resulted in low averages all around-- not a big shocker. While there were a couple of outliers with up to 50% ratio listed at 1-2, they were too few and far between to bring the average ratio up above 10%.
<br><br>
Although the NC value system has no true "1" value-- If your item's ratio is less than 10%, a value of 1 is probably a safe bet (unless your item is exceptionally rare). These items will naturally still see trades, but either the demand isn't high enough or the supply just isn't low enough to drive the value any higher.
</blockquote>

<h1>2: Small but steady (26 entries)</h1>
<blockquote>
This was the only "single" number value with enough entries available to be statistically significant. (ie. 3 only had a handful of entries, and 4 had one measly entry.) But this is good, because it helps paint a strong picture of the point where 1-2s stop being maybe 1s and start being probably 2s. Turns out this point is right around 20%.
<br><br>
The 2 category in general was also very swingy; there were quite a few outliers and underliers, although they evened themselves out in the end. I assume this has to do with the "sticky" nature of the 1-2 price point; in order for people to really put their foot down and start charging 2 instead of 1, sometimes the ratio has to skew way beyond what it should to make it happen.
</blockquote>

<h1>2-3: Now we're getting somewhere (77 entries)</h1>
<blockquote>
Now the price has officially broken free of those pesky 1s, it takes a moment to stretch its legs and put a little distance between them. The average ratio for 2-3 was right around 35%. A pretty chunky category with it's fair share of high and low swingers, it evens out in the end for a pretty stable and predictable number.
</blockquote>

<h1>2-4: Bit of a weirdo, but every bit helps (25 entries)</h1>
<blockquote>
2-4 is a strange range, coming in at around 40% average ratio. This isn't typically a range you see people actively using to price items, which means it's mostly just a side effect of market volatility-- things people can't agree on the value of. Its primary purpose here on the chart is reinforcing the 2-3 and 3-4 slot by falling about where it should in-between them-- favoring the "2" side because there are a few more 2s in the category than 4s.
</blockquote>

<h1>3-4: Steady as she goes (29 entries)</h1>
<blockquote>
Not too much to say about 3-4; it's a nice steady category without too many positive or negative outliers. At 48% ratio, it's more or less the halfway point between the 1-2s and the 5-6s-- which is just as it should be.
</blockquote>


<h1>3-5: Hey, get back here! (41 entries)</h1>
<blockquote>
3-5! Why are you ahead of 4-5? Get back here and wait your turn!
<br><br>
Looking at the entries for this category, it seems like the reason 3-5 is in a weird spot ratio-wise is it has a handful of items in there who really don't belong, with ratios nearing 200%-- and one going as high as 246%. Either these items were once much cheaper but had a sudden jump in popularity, or perhaps there were a string of trades that severely undervalued them-- either way, they drag the average of the 3-5 range to 81%-- way above where it probably should be, around 60-65%.
<br><br>
The good news is that the Seeking and Offering averages for 3-5 are actually where they belong between 3-4 and 4-5, which means 3-5s weird ratio placement is probably just data noise that will smooth itself out with time.
</blockquote>


<h1>4-5: A safe haven in the storm (22 entries)</h1>
<blockquote>
4-5 is a good, solid category. With an average ratio of around 73%, it actually had very few major outliers, for better or for worse, which means it's a reliable breath of fresh air between two very annoying brats.
</blockquote>

<h1>4-6: What are you doing I can't even (27 entries)</h1>
<blockquote>
Those of you who looked at the charts may have noticed this little runaway. 4-6s ratio is not only above 5-6, but also above 5-8, and it nearly passes 6-8 as well. And unlike the 3-5 category, 4-6s average seeking and offering placements are even worse, with seeking numbers way past 6-8 and offering number tied with 8-10. It is the lowest range that breaks the 100% barrier on average (ie. there are more people seeking than offering), despite the fact that it probably should be back at 90-95%.
<br><br>
So what gives?
<br><br>
Well, best I can figure, this category is chock full of BGs, effects, eyes, makeup, and other generally very strong pops that people are just kind of… undercharging for. One theory is perhaps people are hesitant to leave 5 behind and move on towards 10, for risk of seeming like they're overcharging. Another theory is perhaps this is the point where "pops" truly are born-- people begin adding them to their seeking lists simply because they are popular, and the Owls price can't keep up with the quick fluctuation in ratio. 
<br><br>
Whatever the reason, as-is, many current entries in the (4-6) category probably belong in the (6-8) or possibly even the (8-10) category instead, and the data for (4-6) will likely not be where it belongs until the average ratios stabilize a bit.
</blockquote>

<h1>5-6 and 5-8: Where re-releases and DW originals go to die (32 entries)</h1>
<blockquote>
Hindered by some nasty re-releases and some less-desirable DW originals (several of which clock in at less than 20% ratio, which means they aren't even really worth 2 anymore), 5-6 at 91% and 5-8 at 112% are probably both a bit below where they should be on the curve. Personally, I believe 5-6 is just about the right spot for crossing the 100% barrier, assuming the offering or seeking numbers aren't too far off the 5-6 average as well.
<br><br>
As for the re-releases; well, sometimes it's time to face the music and let things be worth what they're worth, instead of clinging to what they used to be worth. Dodging re-releases is one of the biggest reasons to always check DTI ratios for big ticket items. They are VERY easy to spot.
</blockquote>

<h1>6-8: Getting lumpy (28 entries)</h1>
<blockquote>
By the time we reach 6-8, data points are starting to get scarcer--to reinforce consistency, this category lumps together the 6, 6-7, 6-8, and 7-8 categories, since statistically they're going to be about the same anyways. Clocking in at 127% ratio, this category is another solid one, with only a small handful of outliers that don't swing the average too far away from where it should be.
</blockquote>

<h1>8-10: Sticking point (22 entries)</h1>
<blockquote>
While the average ratio of this category works out around 150%, it's much more swingy in nature than 6-8 was. There are several clear re-releases caught in here that clearly don't belong at this price point anymore, as well as several super pops that really should be charging more like 20-30. I know 10 is a nice even number, but it's time to leave it behind for greener pastures!
</blockquote>

<h1>10-15 (34 entries) and beyond (43 entries): Playing with the big boys now</h1>
<blockquote>
Beyond this point, there isn't too much to say-- data points are getting scarce so categories like 12-15 and 15-18 have to get logged into bigger chunks to be statistically significant. 
<br><br>
The ratio progression is relatively predictable from here on out, so the charts mostly speak for themselves-- the only blip is the Seeking # for 20-30 being lower than 15-20; it shouldn't be, but my assumption is this is the price point where people begin to take the item off of their wishlist, for fear of never being able to afford it.
<br><br>
I would encourage everyone to leave very expensive, "unobtainable" things that they really like or want on a wishlist of some sort, even if it's just a dream list-- you'll be helping the community out by making it easier for these higher value items to be weighted against the rest.
<br><br>
I cut the final point off at 30+. While there are definitely items that sit at much higher values than 30, /~Owls simply doesn't have enough of them logged yet for me to draw any significant conclusions from the data. However, from what I saw, there really isn't THAT much of a difference between them; at that point it just comes down to inflation and the likeliness of finding a buyer who is willing to waaaaay overpay you for the item.
