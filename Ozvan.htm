<div style="width: 65%; text-align: justify; margin: auto;">
<p>Hello, the_freebie_man_! Welcome to <em>The Company of Giants</em>. This world and the characters in it have been years in the making, so I'm very excited to share them with you! Ever since my friend Victoria and I created a backstory that related our pets together, I've been picking away at this fantasy world that found its roots in Neopets lore, but was eventually morphed into something that was influenced by various myths, fantasy tropes, and elements of stories I've enjoyed over the years.</p>

<p>Everything on this page, from the storyline to the characters and, most recently as of December 2023, the complete overhaul of the coding, has been a labour of love. I've had so much fun over the past few years thinking about how my pets and their designs and backstories could work together. As it happens when years pass and people take hiatuses, some designs have changed from the original, but it's these same characters that have taken me out of hiatus time and time again.</p>

<p><i>Giants</i> only lists my permanent pets that exist in this world, with the rest hanging out over at <a href="/~unhallowed">Fellverse</a>. However, as a project that encapsulates my 10 years of world-building, some secondary characters with names of pets I have since traded away or adopted out still exist in the verse's mythos. If you happen to be the owner of one of these pets and prefer for me to rename them, please don't hesitate to <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=nymerosmartell">drop me a line</a>. Thanks very much for being here, and I hope you enjoy browsing around! â™¡</p>

<div class="clear"></div>

<p><strong>Ozvan</strong> is not a landmass, but the back of an ancient beast in eternal sleep who was created by the old gods long before even The Circle was brought together. According to the oldest Ozvani myths, the beast Ozvan would rise to bring about the end of days once the gods willed it. Until then, it would remain dormant, and the civilisations that rose upon its back could live on and thrive none-the-wiser. The most prominent of these was <em>The Empire of Argyra</em>, which spanned over half the continent at the peak of its power. The empire was made up of <i>Old Argyra</i> in the north, where the gods of The Circle first descended upon the earth; <i>Crownpoint</i>, the empire's administrative centre, just beneath it; and the sea-facing territories of <i>Argyra Cove</i> and <i>Eastern Argyra</i>, the home of the empire's navies.</p>

<p>Before the empire was formed, its territories were a swath of lands where curious, powerful deities roamed. These eternal entities had the power to control time and space, the heat and the cold, the stars and the sea, life and death. They ruled over the earth and the sky before returning to the stars, signalling the end of that would be known as <strong>the Astral Age</strong>. Upon the Ascension, they left behind races of mages imbued with special powers as their <em>inheritors</em>. Argonar, Father of the Earth, was the last of the gods to ascend. For that reason, the empire became known as <b>Argyra</b>, and its people <i>Argyrans</i>.</p>

<p>Imperial territory was separated from the rest of the continent by a stretch of the desert known as <em>the False Sea</em>, hostile and inhospitable to life except for its three lakes, around which small, disparate communities sprung. The <b>Spider's Belt</b>, a series of three interconnected mountain ranges, acted as a natural border between Argyra and the False Sea. The oldest of the Belt, known as the <i>Balvran Mountains</i>, was sacred to Argonar, who made the <strong>Argyran Groves</strong> at the summit of <i>Mt Ionna</i>, the tallest of the Balvrans, after the birth of his son, Scipio, Fount of War.</p>

<p>East of the False Sea and bordering it and East Argyra was the kingdom of <b>Inkerza</b>, old allies of Argyra's ancient rivals, the sea-kingdom of <i>Garverre</i>. To the west, miles off the shore of the Cove, sat the island kingdom of <b>Yrsella</b>. Together with the empire, they were known as <strong>the Crownlands</strong>. Inkerza and the False Sea also bordered <i>the Federation of the Valley Freelands</i>, who, though a conglomerate made up of several independently-aligned territories, tended to be friendly with Argyra on the whole.</p>

<p>A glacial mountain range known as <strong>Winter's Ravine</strong> divided the Freelands from <em>the Ionnian Protectorate</em>, or Ionnia, a country established by the god Scipio during the tail-end of the Astral Age. It was named for his birthplace, Mt Ionna, and continues to be ruled by warlords of his divine bloodline. It was in the icy territory of the Ravine that the <em>Kingdom of Solvalle</em> rose after its founders were chased out of Inkerza after a failed rebellion against the ruling house. Because of its controversial origins â€” and the fact that Solvalle's own eventual ruling house had angered the half-divine son of Necea, Jewel of the Sea â€” Solvalle was not a recognised Crownland, and it was unacknowledged as a sovereign nation by all powers except microstates in Freelands.</p>

<p>Finally, in the underbelly of the continent existed <b>Inkozi</b>, the land of the dead, separated from the world of the living by a sprawling castle called the Wyvern's Gate, so named for the god of the ether who ruled over death until he gave his kingdom to one of his sons. Along with the Gate was the Wyvern's Mouth, a magical river made up of its prisoners' fears and final hopes.</p>

<h1>The Gods of the Circle</h1>
<p><b>The Circle</b> was the name given to the pantheon of Ozvani gods who played an important role across the continent and the Crownlands. They were the primary driving force before the creation of the Argyran Empire, and their powers were responsible for the flourishing of the Ozvani continent. Many of these deities gave their names to the mages who inherited parts of their power following the Ascension, but not all of them. Furthermore, the Circle was not only made up of gods, but the children and creations of the gods. Mexra, Beast of Eternity, was created after the Ascension in order to defend the gods' new home in the constellation of The Riversnake â€” the only constellation that was not named for them, but for their father The Ether, who was said to take the shape of a snake or a river, and who created the world for their mother, The Darkness. Another, a great horned beast called Kuuyo, acted as the gatekeeper of the Balvran Mountains.</p>

</div>
<div class="blurb">
<p><strong>Ayrmidon</strong>, known as The Exalted, was the wisest of the gods and was looked upon as the leader of The Circle. Also worshipped as <em>The First Divine</em>, Ayrmidon was known as a judicious, fair-tempered god who was less prone to emotionality or impulsiveness, which led many to portray him as cold and aloof in Argyran myths. Myths that originated around the False Sea tended to be kinder to his disposition. He had several children, among them Necea, Jewel of the Sea, and Asoza, Crown of Winter. His wife was Amacina, Consort of the Cosmos. Though Ayrmidon was a benevolent god to the <em>Ayrmireidae</em> and appeared relatively often in the dreams of his prophets, he was otherwise not known to intervene in mortal affairs. This pattern continued even after Asoza, his youngest daughter, married Keiam, heir to Argyra yet still a mortal mage, blessed by Cyran, who was Ayrmidon's younger brother. The <i>Crowgarde</i>, a cult centred around awaiting the next time Ayrmidon would walk the mortal plane, rose in the First Arosian Age under the auspices of the Ayrmirid Idus Aroso.</p>

</div>
<div class="blurb">
<p><strong>Amacina</strong>, one of the night goddesses in the Ozvani pantheon, was consort to Ayrmidon. She was a daughter of the Starkeeper and the Moonheart, and because of the realm of her magic, she was called <em>Nightkissed</em>. When Ayrmidon asked for her hand in marriage, the Starkeeper gave him <b>thirteen tasks</b> to complete in order to prove his devotion, desire, loyalty, and love. Each task later came to represent a month in the Ozvani calendar. Amacina was known to be Ayrmidon's complete opposite: lively where he was dour, pleasant where he was severe, warm where he was aloof. Most myths addressing their love story indicate that Amacina loved Ayrmidon more than he loved her, but <i>The Company of Giants</i>, written under the supervision of their daughter Asoza, repudiated this by saying that the deities loved one another fiercely and equally. Neither <i>Giants</i> nor popular literature produced during the Second Argyran Age when the Cyraneidae came to power addressed Amacina's reaction to the gossip surrounding Asoza's parentage; Asoza was always regarded as her daughter.</p>

<div class="blurb">
<p><strong>Cyran</strong>, known as The Deathless, Ayrmidon's younger brother. He spent nine months of the year in Ikdozi, the land of the dead, where he ruled over his domain with a severe, unpitying hand. He was not born to rule over death, but instead came upon it by chance after accidentally falling into the Wyvern's Mouth, the river beneath Wyvern's Gate, the sprawling castle that separated the land of the living from death's domain. He was rescued by his father, Sezoa, Song of Nightmares. Cyran received death's domain upon the Ascension; had any other sibling fallen into the Wyvern's Mouth, death would have gone to them, instead. The Cyraneidae were famous for wreaking havoc across the Ozvan continent, generally free from rebuke from the god himself unless the balance of humanity was disrupted, and sometimes even then, only at the urging of his older brother. A shy and reticent god even before the isolation his mantle called for, Cyran rarely appeared to his prophets, and mostly communicated to his siblings or through them.</p>

<p><strong>Argonar</strong> was the last god of the Circle to ascend at the end of the Astral Age. In tribute, the long stretch of the Ozvan continent that housed these deities came to be known as Argyra. Argonar was responsible for the creation of <b>The Spider's Belt</b>, which split Crownpoint, the empire's eventual administrative centre, from The False Sea. He was father to Diaphine, Daughter of Spring, and Scipio, Fount of War.</p>

</div>
<div class="blurb">
<p><strong>Leforo</strong> was a self-born god who drew his strength from the night, growing stronger at the moment of sunset and at the peak of his power during the ghost hours after midnight. One of primordial gods, he had a rivalry with Scipio, Fount of War, because he had strong ties to Vestos, the god whom Scipio replaced in the pantheon. Their hundreds of skirmishes all across Argyra gave way to the <i>Tectonic Age</i>, marked by earthquakes resulting from their fights that ravaged the continent. When they were temporarily exiled by The First Divine and made to survive on just a fraction of their power, Leforo made his way to Old Garverre. Once there, Leforo became central to a group of devout followers who became known as <b>The Night Cult</b>, whom Leforo later recognised as proto-Leforoneidae. The Night Cult and the Leforoneidae, who were created after the Ascension when Leforo regained his strength and was welcomed back into The Circle, are one of the few links between Garverre and Argyra that was not severed during the Second Lotus War, when the respective kings of each ancient nation declared each other to be traitors.</p>

<p><strong>Necea</strong> was one of the daughters of Ayrmidon, The Exalted. Haughty, proud, and assured of her own strength, Necea was said to have blessed the Ozvan continent with a hundred years of life-sustaining rain when a cult rose in her name and proclaimed her the most powerful daughter of The First Divine. As fickle as the ebb and flow of the waves, Necea granted her favour as quickly as she took it away. She had a child with a mortal mage, the old king of Inkerza, and their child, Ilizo, The Iron King, rose to power during the Second Argyran Age as a rival of his un<i></i>cle by marriage, Emperor Keiam IV, whose wife was Necea's youngest sister, Asoza, Crown of Winter. As the sea goddess, Necea saw all the waters of the world as her territory; in particular, she favoured the waters of the sea-kingdom, Garverre. After Ilizo's birth, she made the Inkerzan capital of Eniara her home for a short time.</p>

<p><strong>Asoza</strong>, Crown of Winter, was also known for a time as Empress of All-Argyra and Queen of Dragonsea-by-Fortuun following her marriage to Keiam, Prince Imperial, and her husband's subsequent ascendance as sovereign. According to Argyra's earliest myths, she was born on the same moonless night that her father, Ayrmidon, raised Yrsella Island from the sea. Because she was the youngest of the gods, by the time the Argyran pantheon ascended, she was unable to leave control over <i>the winter</i> as a gift to the mages. As a result, she retained sole control over cold space and bitter winters, at least until the first Asoneidae â€” her own children, the twin daughters Zilynia and Zrse â€” were born.</p>

Called <em>the Daughter of Spring</em>, Diaphine's powers of healing and empathy balanced life and death. When Asoza, Crown of Winter, sought to marry Keiam, Prince-Imperial, it was Diaphine who devised a solution allowing Asoza a semi-permanent mortal body for ten months out of the year, so long as she spent three full months in her divine form, ensuring that her powers would not wane.</p>

<p><strong>Scipio</strong> was known as <i>the Fount of War</i>. Thanks to his father, he had control over earthquakes and mountains in addition to his godly strength, inhuman agility, and limited-range telekinesis. He was also his father's favourite son. Proud and self-assured to the point of arrogance, Scipio was eager to show off his strength and prove his worth as a member of The Circle. Defiant, rash, and set on proving his worth as a godling, Scopio made a quick enemy out of Leforo, and Argyra suffered an age of earthquakes before Ayrmidon interveneted and banished them from the Circle. Though eventually restored to his full power and reinstated into the pantheon, Scipio spent some time as an exorbitantly expensive sellsword during his banishment. After founding the Sellswords of the Sun, he earned the moniker <b>Sunforger</b>.</p>

<p><strong>Vestos</strong> was once mortal. A younger son of House Thamza who was destined to live in the shadow of his older brothers, he desperately sought for a way to make a name for himself. He found his way to fame when The Circle announced the <i>Feast of the Apotheosis</i>, a continent-wide tournament where the winner would gain the ultimate prize: become a god and join the pantheon. Beating out thousands of competitors with strength and cunning, Vestos shed his mortal name and took on the mantle of <em>Warzone</em>. His divinity was granted to him by The Ether, though the process was not without pain or scarring: a scar shaped like The Riversnake constellation, which represented The Ether, bisected Vestos' face as a reminder of his immortality being poured into him, rather than him being born with it. After Scipio's birth, Vestos was <i>unmade</i>, though lingering effects of his once-divinity include a heavily lengthened lifespan, the ability to communicate directly with the divine without an intercessor, and some strength.</p>

<h1>The Ozvani Dynasties</h1>
<p>Ozvani peoples prided themselves on their individual tethers to the Circle, which physically manifested as the source of their magical power. Not everyone in the world of Argyra is capable of magic, so the presence of superhuman abilities was said to have signified a soul that <em>resonated</em> with divinity. Each Ozvani blessed by the same god was known to be part of a <b>dynasty</b>; this term did not necessarily imply blood ties, though it <i>was</i> used in the more common definition of the word when it came to ruling and sovereign families.</p>

<p>Mages, as the blessed ones were known, always had the chance to pass their affinity onto their offspring; descendants could also manifest the magic of another mage further up their family tree. For example, Zita del Ereos, an Ozvani merchant-turned-pirate from the 8th century, was an Ayrmirid whose parents were a Cyranid and a Dianid. At the same time, though she was a Cyranid, she was not at all related to the imperial bloodline at the time.</p>

<p>Any union of two mages, even extremely powerful ones, still had the chance of producing a child that was <strong>voidborn</strong>, a term used for Ozvani who do not have any magic. In cities with high concentrations of magical ancestry, this word is used pejoratively, and the term <em>dormant</em> is preferred in polite society. It is theorised that voidborn souls failed to resonate with the magic of any of the Circle, and thus they could not be opened to receive any of the Circle's blessings. The Valley Freelands have the highest concentration of voidborn Ozvani, many of whom are found in the various sellsword companies that offer their sk<i></i>ills to the highest bidders.</p>

<h2>Ayrmireidae</h2>
<p>The <b>Ayrmireidae</b> (sing. <i>Ayrmirid</i>) were inheritors of Ayrmidon, The First Divine. As magical legacies of The Exalted, Ayrmireidae had a reputation for being some of the cleverest, most innovative mages in Ozvan, and were most often found in cities with large educated populaces. They were powerful on raw magic alone, but made more dangerous by the fact that tapping into Ayrmidon's inheritance allowed them to use the gifts of other dynasties, though at a fraction of what their power would be like when tapping into their god's gift. Ayrmidon gave his inheritors <b>mastery over shadows</b>, which ranged from using the shadows to communicate, to forming warriors made out of shadow to do one's bidding. Idus Aroso, for whom the Arosian Age is named, was a notorious Ayrmirid.</p>

<h2>Cyraneidae
</h2><p>The <b>Cyraneidae</b> (sing. <i>Cyranid</i>) were inheritors of Cyran, The Deathless. Cyraneidae had the power of foreknowledge of others' death upon contact with exposed skin; whether they had influence on it before or after touch remains unknown. A derivative of this power was the ability to <b>induce sleep</b>, which manifested in uses such as one's revitalisation, or, more malevolently, to curse someone with an eternal sleep that could only be lifted by another â€” and, more often, more powerful â€” Cyranid. Cyraneidae such as Keiam IV, The Favoured, dominated the Second Argyran Age.</p>

<h2>Argoneidae</h2>
<p>The <b>Argoneidae</b> (sing. <i>Argonid</i>) were inheritors of Argonar, Father of the Earth. Because Argonar was the god that gave his name to the Empire of All-Argyra, his inheritors were sometimes known as the <i>First Children</i> to distinguish them from the other dynasties; this was not particularly popular with the Ayrmireidae, who were the first inheritors created. Argoneidae were capable of <b>manipulating the earth</b>, which resulted in anything from taming animals, causing earthquakes, and encouraging growth on infertile land. The most famous Argonid of all was Argonar's own son, the god Scipio, who also had his own mages.</p>

<h2>Leforoneidae</h2>
<p>The <b>Leforoneidae</b> (sing. <i>Leforonid</i>) were inheritors of Leforo, The Twilight Lord. Mages of the god of discord, Leforoneidae had abilities of <b>lunar magic manipulation</b> and <b>mental manipulation</b>, but, notably, these magics only worked after sunset and could, in some instances, be combated by artificial light. Nevertheless, they were feared for their ability to burrow themselves into one's psyche, and thus driving their enemies to madness. Aside from close ties to The Night Cult, which survived the Ascension, Leforoneidae tended to work closely with Ayrmireidae and Cyraneidae. Agio, Duke of Lau, the Warden of Inkerza, was a Leforonid.</p>

These mages were <b>healers</b> and <b>empaths</b>, allowing them to control, heighten, and dampen emotions at will. They were highly sought after across the continent, and some religious sects rose to glorify, protect, and encourage the Dianid bloodlines. Alheza Edenveil, Queen of Inkzera as wife of Ilizo I, is one of the most famous Dianeidae in history. Many scholars of Inkerzan history and international relations posit that Alheza's control over her gifts helped her navigate the myriad diplomatic situations she was famous for handling.</p>

<p>The <b>Sketheneidae</b> (sing. <i>Skethenid</i>) were inheritors of Scipio, Fount of War, himself an Argonid. Blessed with <b>superhuman strength and agility</b>, and equipped with minor control of the earth, Sketheneidae often made up sellsword companies, many of which were based in Ionnia, home of Scipio's bloodline. Others were employed as personal guards or private assassins across the continent. A prominent Skethenid, Viktoriya Driega, rose to infamy in Inkerza as a leader of the rebellious anti-Neceneidae faction during the rule of Ilizo I; she later became the first queen of Solvalle.</p>

More than any other god save for Diaphine, Necea was known to be close to her inheritors, and frequently lived among them for a handful of years throughout every age. The Neceneidae boasted <b>mastery of liquids</b>, controlling all kinds of substances from water to blood, but only the most powerful of them could control their patron's domain of the seas. Tisje I of Garverre was the most powerful Neceid of his generation, so strong, in fact, that it was rumoured he could have singlehandedly overwhelmed the defences of Yrsella Island if he tried.</p>

Born after her father, the First Divine, ascended to the cosmos, centuries passed before the first Asoneidae were born â€” and even then, they were exceptions to the rule, for they were true blood children of the goddess, rather than just inheritors of her <b>frost magics</b>. Zilynia I, the first empress <span class="italic">suo jure</span> of the Argyran Empire, and her twin, Imperial High General Zrse Queensblade, inherited their mother's magic rather than their father's.</p>

<p>The <em>Rulyaneidae</em> (sing. <span class="italic">Rulyanid</span>) were inheritors of a goddess called Rullaea, The Moon-touched. These mages had magics rooted in <b>illusions</b>, derived from the shadow-making power of Rullaea's father, Ayrmidon. Although they could cast illusions so realistic that people could be trapped in them for good, they also had a limitation on their power, only being able to cast once the sun has set because their illusions are made in conjunction with starlight. They are the most powerful when surrounded by the forests of Mount Rulya.</p>

<p>The <em>Sezoneidae</em> (sing. <span class="italic">Sezonid</span>) were inheritors of Sezoa, The Song of Nightmares, one of the original Cyraneidae. Sezoneidae had the ability to act as <b>amplifiers for negative emotions</b>, and thrived in places often perceived as lawless, encouraging fear, terror, anxiety, and desperation. The Sellswords of the Sun employed Sezonids to guard their prisoners and for ease of interrogations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After the Ascension, generations passed before most of the Circle deigned to interact with their inheritors aside from the intercession of their saints and prophets. It was not until the start of <em>the Dragonsea Wars</em> at the dawn of the Second Argyran Age, when war broke out between Argyra and Garverre, that they decided to take a more active role in mortal and worldly affairs again.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="clear"></div>

<div class="ozvan">
<div class="pad">
<h1>The Crownlands</h1>

<p><b>The Crownlands</b> officially consisted of the Empire of All-Argyra; the Sea-Kingdom of Garverre; the Kingdom of Inkerza; and Yrsella Island. A fifth kingdom, the Kingdom of Solvalle, was technically a Crownland, but it was not recognised as such and the other four kingdoms established no trade or diplomatic relationships with it due to the controversy surrounding its founding.</p>

<p>The <em>Empire of All-Argyra</em>, most commonly known as Argyra, was founded immediately following The Ascension, in what has become known as Imperial Year 0. As such, it was the oldest of the Crownlands, and many of the other territories were carved out of it in subsequent centuries. Although it originally had a rotating monarchy in place, the outbreak of the Dragonsea Wars in Imperial Year 752 led to the consolidation of power by the Cyraneidae by Year 782. The Cyraneidae ushered in the Second Argyran Age, and then soundly dominated it for generations.</p>

<p>The <em>Sea-Kingdom of Garverre</em> was a dual kingdom, existing on the other side of the Dragonsea above and underneath the surface of the surrounding oceans. It was founded in Year 427 and named for St Elodie Garverre, Martyr of the Deep, whose House led their neighbouring territories to victory against Argyra, earning their independence. Favoured by the goddess Necea, most Garverri manifested as Neceneidae, or as Leforoneidae, after Leforo made Old Garverre his home following a temporary banishment from The Circle during the Tectonic Age.</p>

<p>The <em>Kingdom of Inkerza</em> was founded in Year 509. Formerly Argyra's southeastern-most territory, Rhaezo, a warlord from Winter's Ravine who styled himself The Winter King, invaded less than a century after Garverre broke off from the empire, as a sign of devotion to Fayula of House Zymra, a feared warrior who was known in Ionnian Protectorate as the Bronze Tiger. She was one of Scipio's most decorated inheritors, and the first woman to lead the Sellswords of the Sun. When they married, Rhaezo took Fayula's name; their descendants still rule Inkerza to this day.</p>

<p><em>Yrsella Island</em> was raised from the depths of the sea by the First Divine. Along with it came the spirit of the Queen of Rebirth, who ruled over Yrsella even before it was brought to the surface. It is the birthplace of Asoza, Crown of Winter, and remains an important part in her mythology as the place where she would return to her divine form three months out of the year during her marriage to Keiam. Although Yrsella was a sovereign Crownland, it was sometimes mistakenly considered a protectorate of the Argyran Empire because of its strong association with Ayrmidon and Asoza.</p>

<p>The <em>Kingdom of Solvalle</em> was formed in the aftermath of the Rebellion of the Anti-Neceneidae Federation. Carved out of the most livable part of Winter's Ravine â€” the glacial, nigh inhospitable territory between Ionnia and the Freelands â€” Solvalle declared itself an independent kingdom and Viktoriya Driega as its first queen after more Federation loyalists and sympathisers escaped from Inkerza. Never earning the recognition of the other Crownlands, it was sometimes known as the Abandoned Kingdom.</p>

<div class="pad">
<h1>The Empire of All-Argyra</h1>
<p>The <i>Emperor of All-Argyra</i> has always ruled from the capital city of <strong>Andura</strong>, built on the shores of the Lake of Pines. Imperial rule was originally decided by the the order of the Pantheon; thus, Ayrmidon's mages ruled the first century, then Cyran's, and so on. The first rulers of the empire were known as <em>the Triad</em>, selected from Ayrmidon's Sacred Twenty, and these three lords would rule together for a decade until Idus Aroso, Third Lord, decided he wanted to consolidate imperial power for himself. Because of this, the First Ayrmirid Age is also sometimes known as the Arosian Era.</p>

<p>After a cycle of shifting power, the Cyraneidae came to power again in the middle of the 7th century, proceeding to exert power and influence all across Argyra throughout the <b>Second Argyran Age</b> after the outbreak of the Dragonsea Wars. Emperor <em>Keiam IV</em> fought to expand Argyra's borders well past the Alrian Line to the shores of Garverre, and though both territories were held at the Line at war's end and the only concessions were the redrawing of Dragonsea borders, this feat of strength meant that no foreign power dared to take on the empire for generations to come.</p>

<p>In a feat no mortal before him had ever accomplished, Keiam married Ayrmidon's divine blood when he wed <em>Asoza, Crown of Winter</em>. They had four children and ushered a new age of prosperity for the empire. Near the end of his reign, Keiam commissioned <i>The Company of Giants</i>, a comprehensive seven-volume history of Argyra. Thanks to his personal connection to the Circle, <em>Giants</em> remains notable for its several personal anecdotes meant to "humanise" the image of the divine. Although the books are still in production today, Keiam's original copies were tragically lost during the <b>Lotus Burning</b> during the Fourth Great Argyran War. A painstakingly recreated copy is one of the Imperial Museum's most popular attractions.</p>

<h1>The Sea-Kingdom of Garverre</h1>
<p>The <b>Sea-Kingdom of Garverre</b> is a dual kingdom that lies simultaneously above the sea and sprawled underneath it. It was founded in Imperial Year 427, after a ten-year struggle against the Empire of Argyra. The River Rebellion, as it was known, was instigated by St Elodie Garverre, the heiress to House Garverre; known as <i>the Seasaint</i>, she led her family and their banners to victory, though sadly, she did not live to see the kingdom rise in her father's name. Statues of Elodie guard the land and sea capitals of Garverre today.</p>

<p>As a sea kingdom, Garverri are highly favoured by <strong>Necea, Jewel of the Sea</strong>, and both above and under water, the kingdom is almost homogeneously Neceneidae. The Garverri monarch rules with the Council of Sea-Lords, inherited seats belonging to Garverre's most powerful families. All but two Sea-Lords of any council iteration are always Neceneidae. Some Garverri also manifest as Leforoneidae, for the God of Discord once settled in Old Garverre, where <em>the Night Cult</em> once rose.</p>

<p>In the eighth century after Ascension, <i>Tisje Seabound</i> inherited the throne. As the most powerful Neceid to manifest in generations, the respect he commanded amongst his own people was a source of anxiety for their neighbour, Yrsella Island: though their queen was known for her powerful protective wards, she was still no match for a Neceid who showed mastery of the sea, as Tisje did.</p>
