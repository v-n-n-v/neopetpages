 <h1>Welcome to <b>Celestial</b></h1>
<h3>A directory home for Fallen Stars, Aliens and Brave Space Explorers.</h3>





<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Bir2Wze.png" style="width: 425px;"><b>Welcome to Celestial</b>.
<i>A directory home for all Fallen Stars, Aliens and Brave Space Explorer neopets.</i>


<br><br>
My name's <b>Anna</b>. Since coming back from a hiatus in late 2016, I had been thinking of creating a pet directory of some sort, but never had a solid idea. Around the time of mid 2017 my love for spacey things grew dramatically and I found myself with many space themed and related pets. <i>my star children.</i> Fast forward to late 2018/ early 2019 and I find myself talking with my good guild mate, and friend <b>Olive</b>. We were discussing one day, about pet directory's, and she had showed me hers, and <i>I felt inspired to really do one this time!</i> It was an obvious choice what my theme was going to be! With that, <strong>Celestial</strong> <i>the space themed and space related pet directory was created!</i>

<br><br>
My Goal for <strong>Celestial</strong> is for this to be a place to list Permanent Space pets. Pets that qualify for listing are the following: <b> Starry</b> pained pets, <b>Eventide</b> Painted pets, <b>Alien</b> Aishas, and <b>Customized Space</b> themed pets.
<br>
My only other requirements for a pet to be listed here is they <i>must</i> be a permanent pet. And are required to be wearing <i>atleast</i> a background! As we dont want our pets listed here getting lost in space!
<br><br>If you own a neopet that fits one of these categories you may join! If your pet is a listed colour and also a space themed customization they will be automatically listed by their colour!.
<br><b>Please note:</b> pets applying for the customization section are subjective. <i>I reserve the right to decide whether they fit with the directory's theme.</i> If you are unsure with what this entails please <a href="/~Celestiahl#space">jump down</a> to the customized space pets part to see my pets, and others, who fit the theme!

 <h1>Frequently Asked<b> Questions</b></h1>
<h3>Some answers for your questions.</h3>

<b>Q: Why do Grundos not have a specific listing area?</b>
<br><i>A:</i> I understand that Grundos are the token space/alien pet of Neopets. But for this directory i personally wanted this to focus more on the colours, and customization than a whole species. I did try to work in Grundos in the beginning but i personally didn't like the idea of having a species section, with only 1 species in it. To me it looked a little weird, and outta place. Grundos can totally still be listed though, provided they fit into one of the categories above!!
