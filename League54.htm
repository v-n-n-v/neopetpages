	<hr><span class="subtitle"><b>WHY WOULD I GET INTO L54?</b></span>

	<p>League 54 is an easy to train league. And it is not expensive: many great weapons can be bought in the shop wizard! The organizer and winner of the first L54 championship, <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=drazu">drazu</a>, battled with a 4M set (his own words). Also, it is a very fun league, so why don't you get started?</p>
	<p>If you have any questions not answered by this guide, <a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=hamsterpellet">please mail me</a>. I am happy to help; maybe I'll also add the explanation in the guide.</p>
	<p>The battledome currently has a lot of glitches, but we have to learn to survive while they don't fix them. If you are curious about this, read more on the <a href="#glitches">glitches section</a>.</p>
	<p>If you have your pet ready, feel free to challenge me for a fight! My L54 pet is <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=League54">League54</a>. I usually are very busy though, but if I am available, it will be a pleasure.</p>
	<p>If you don't like the idea of participating in a tournament, you can hopefully find someone to battle for fun every day! L54 fights usually don't last as nearly as long as L97 battles. Go to the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=10">Battledome Chat</a> and look for L54 battles!</p>

	<hr><span class="subtitle"><b>ARE THERE ANY TOURNAMENTS?</b></span>

	<p>Tournaments are organized from time to time. Check below for more information. You can also go to the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=10">Battledome Chat</a> to watch out for upcoming tournaments!</p>

	</ul><hr><span class="subtitle"><b>THE RULES</b></span>

	<ul><li><b>Endurance: 54   |   Strength: between 13 and 19 (inclusive)   |   Defence: between 35 and 54 (inclusive)</b> (read <a href="#build">this section</a> to know more)</li>
		<li><b>#01</b> All weapons are limited to 10.0 attack icons. This limit applies to the maximum icons of the weapon (NOT the average)! <i>Example: Altadorian Halberd is not allowed because although its average is 9.65 icons, it is possible that it attacks with more than 10.0 icons.</i></li>
		<li><b>#02</b> Dual-duties are limited to 13.0 total icons. This limit applies to the maximum icons of the weapon (NOT the average)! Percentage-based defenses are not considered in this calculation. <i>Example: Kaylas Hat is not allowed because it has a total of 15 icons.</i></li>
		<li><b>#03</b> Full blockers (items that block 100% of a certain icon) and attack with more than 5.0 icons are NOT allowed. <i>Examples: Hanso Charisma Charm is not allowed, while Altadorian Swordbreaker, Shield of Pion Troect and Frozen Cyodrake Shield are allowed. Skarls Amulet is NOT allowed because it breaks another rule (it violates the dual-duty icon limit, since it has a total of 20.0 icons).</i></li>
		<li><b>#04</b> Healers cannot heal more than 60 HP or 50 HP if overheal. <i>Examples: full healers like Leaded Elemental Vial are therefore allowed, because they will heal at most 54 HP (no overheal). Short Sleeved Yellow Tunic is not allowed because it heals 75 HP, which is greater than 60.</i></li>
		<li><b>#05</b> There are no restrictions for shields, except for the specific ones listed in the banned list below. <i>Shields are weapons that only block icons, without attacking or doing anything else.</i></li>
		<li><b>#06</b> Reflectors are allowed (unless they break other rules). <i>Examples: simple reflectors like U-Bend of Great Justice are allowed, but Dark Faerie Collar is not allowed because it breaks other rules.</i></li>
		<li><b>#07</b> Only Faerie Abilities of level 1, 5 and 10 are allowed.</li>
		<li><b>#08</b> No HP drainers. <i>Examples: Glowing Cauldron; Battle Plunger; Cursed Elixir</i></li>
		<li><b>#09</b> No multihealers, no freezers, no stealers.</li>
		<li><b>#10</b> The only single-use items allowed are Jade Elixir, Lucky Robots Foot, Life Giver and Amulet of Life. Any other single-use item is not allowed.</li>
		<li><b>#11</b> Once-per-battle items are allowed (unless they break other rules, of course), except for Caustic Potion and Mud Mixture.</li>
		<li><b>#12</b> No battle altering boons <i>(given by the Obelisk Battleground)</i>.</li>
		<li><b>#13</b> If you give the opponent a disease in battle, provide a cure. <i>Example: if you use Poisonous Flower.</i></li>
		<li><b>#14 - BANNED WEAPONS</b> (specific weapons that are not allowed): Thyoras Tear; Castle Defenders Shield; Dr. Sloths Personal Body Armour; Faerie Tabard; Ghostkershield; Hubrid Nox Memorial Shield; Scroll of Three Curses; Caustic Potion; Mud Mixture. <i>Scroll of Three Curses is banned because despite of what JellyNeo's iDB says, it DOES interact with healing (and also self-damaging!); it turns out to be a bad weapon actually; you wouldn't want to use it anyway.</i></li>
		<li><b>#15 - EXCEPTION WEAPONS</b> (weapons that are allowed even though they break one or more rules): Deadly Pugio; Devious Top Hat and Cane; Fighting Folder; Twisted Dark Dagger; Kau Knight Helmet (since September 03, 2016).</li>
		<li><b>NOTE:</b> If you have any doubt whether a certain weapon is allowed or not in L54, feel free to ask me in a neomail!</li>
		<li>Regarding the weapon Sunblade Replica: it is NOT allowed in L54 per the official rules. Players organized a voting about it, and the majority was in favor of allowing Sunblade Replica as an exception weapon; but it was NOT unanimous. Therefore it remains banned per the official rules. However, a tournament organizer may want to allow it in their specific tournament. <i>For example, the organizer of December 2016's King Of L54 Tournament chose to allow Sunblade Replica on his tournament.</i></li>
		<li>When battles are fought in a best-of-many format, you are allowed (and encouraged) to change your weapons and abilities between battles, if you want.</li>
	</ul><p><i>If a weapon's icons are random, such as Darkness Scarab, the highest amount possible of icons will be considered for the rules. For example, Darkness Scarab is not allowed under the rule #03.</i></p>

	<hr><a name="build"></a><span class="subtitle"><b>THE BUILD</b></span>

	<p>The <i>build</i> of L54 is 54/13/35. This means a pet is eligible to battle L54 if it has <b>exactly 54 hit points (endurance)</b>, and has the <b>13-strength-boost</b> and the <b>35-defense-boost</b>.
	This means your pet can have anywhere from 13 to 19 strength (inclusive) and 35 to 54 defense (inclusive). There is <b>absolutely no advatange or disadvantage</b> in choosing any value between those limits. This is because neopets' battledome works with <i>boosts</i>. If you don't know what that means, I recommend reading the Jellyneo's beginner guide to battling, that can be found in the following link:
	<span class="fakelink"><i>http://battlepedia.jellyneo.net/?go=beginners</i></span></p>

	<hr><a name="term"></a><span class="subtitle"><b>TERMINOLOGY</b></span>

	<ul><li><b>10-iconer (or 10i for short):</b> It's a valid L54 weapon that attacks with 10 icons and does nothing else. <i>Examples: Wraith Scroll, Fiery Battle Duck.</i></li>
		<li><b>Shield:</b> A weapon that only blocks icons, and nothing else. <i>Examples: Wheel Shield, Wanderers Cloak.</i></li>
		<li><b>Dual-duty:</b> A weapon that attacks and defends. <i>Examples: Frozen Water Daggers, Deadly Pugio.</i></li>
		<li><b>Healer:</b> A once-per-battle weapon that heals a lot of HP. <i>Examples: Purple Scorchstone, Rejuvenating Jar of Brains.</i></li>
		<li><b>Combo:</b> A pair of L54 weapons, possibly along with a valid L54 ability. It refers to a move someone can make in a battle. <i>Examples: Frozen Wave Scimitar + Frozen Water Daggers + Static Cling; Wraith Scroll + Wraith Scroll + Halitosis</i></li>
		<li><b>Move:</b> If used as a noun, it is a synonym of "combo". If used as a verb, it means the action of sending your move in a battle, by pressing the "Fight!" button.</li>
		<li><b>Move first:</b> To send your move before your opponent; this is relevant for the Meditate ability, for example. If you don't move first (i.e. move second), it won't heal.</li>
		<li><b>Move second:</b> To send your move after your opponent (see above).</li>
		<li><b>Move advantage:</b> The difference between the damage dealt and the damage taken in a given round. <i>Example: if you use Frozen Wave Scimitar + Frozen Water Daggers + Static Cling and your oponent uses Wheel Shield + Wraith Scroll + Static Cling, your move advantage was <b>-2</b>, since you dealt 4 damage and took 6 damage.</i></li>
		<li><b>Positive advantage:</b> When you deal more damage than you receive, in a given round.</li>
		<li><b>Negative advantage:</b> When you receive more damage than you deal, in a given round.</li>
		<li><b>Heal turn:</b> The round of the battle in which the battler uses his/her healer.</li>
		<li><b>Joint heal turn:</b> A round of the battle in which both battlers uses their healers (happens often, but not always - sometimes one player will heal before the other).</li>
		<li><b>Separate heal turn:</b> A round of the battle in which only one battler uses his/her healers.</li>
		<li><b>FWS:</b> Frozen Wave Scimitar</li>
		<li><b>FWD:</b> Frozen Water Daggers</li>
		<li><b>PSS:</b> Purple Scorchstone</li>
	</ul><hr><span class="subtitle"><b>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</b></span>

	<p><span class="faq">What does a L54 set usually looks like?</span><br>A common L54 set will have one healer, and the other 7 items will be a mixture of what we call <i>10-iconers</i>, <i>shields</i> and <i>dual-duties</i>. Shields are used sparingly, you should see from zero to at most two shields in a set - since the key of L54 is to make a good defense while attacking, by using the powerful dual-duties. I, for example, like to battle with at least four dual-duties in my set.</p>
	<p><span class="faq">How long does a L54 fight usually take?</span><br>Very long battles, with a lot of lag, will be about 30 minutes. But usually, smoothly-paced battles will take from 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
	<p><span class="faq">How many turns does a L54 fight usually have?</span><br>That depends if battlers are defending more or attacking more. In a battle with a lot of good defenses, you could have up to 16 turns (that was the longest battle I ever played). Usually battles will have about 10 turns. Rarely, a battle will be finished "pre-heal" (often in a draw, in this case), taking no more than 6 rounds.</p>
	<p><span class="faq">How diversified are L54 sets?</span><br>Almost all L54 sets will have the Purple Scorchstone as a healer (since it is considered better than RJoB) and the weapons Frozen Wave Scimitar and Frozen Water Daggers, since they are very, very good dual duties (<i>EDIT @ December 2016: recently, I haven't seen the FWS+FWD combo as frequently as I used to see in the past - apparently it was being expected always so people started to look for alternatives</i>). But in general the weapons are very diversified; some people prefer more offensive sets, with many attacking options of different icons, others prefer more defensive sets... There is not one icon that is more expected than the others. There are great weapons around all icons.</p>
	<p><span class="faq">Are the L54 abilities easily expected?</span><br>No! There are players that prefer Static Cling, while others prefer Halitosis. Both have their good reasons. Also, some people prefer Meditate, others prefer Shade. Again, both are good. This is very interesting for L54 - You don't know what abilities your opponent will be using until the fight starts, and this is very interesting for the strategy aspect of L54.</p>
	<p><span class="faq">What is the best healer?</span><br>Purple Scorchstone is considered the best healer, because it overheals (which means it can heal you to over 54 HPs, basically). At the time I wrote this, it costs 2,000,000 NP, which is unfortunate, I admit. Quite expensive. All competitive L54 sets will have one, but it is the only expensive weapon that you could call "essential" But you can use a Greater Healing Scroll to start.</p>
	<p><span class="faq">How many NPs do I need to start?</span><br>500,000 NPs will be enough to start. Let's do the math: you can start with a Greater Healing Scroll as a healer, which costs no more than 200,000 NP. With the other 300,000 NP you can buy several great L54 weapons that are buyable (most of the best L54 weapons are buyable!)</p>
	<p><span class="faq">How many NPs do I need to be competitive?</span><br>5,000,000 NPs are enough. You will want the Purple Scorchstone, and that will be about 2M. There are other items around 1M such as Dusty Magic Broom and Wheel Shield that are very good, you'll probably want them too. Now, most of L54 best items are buyable! Maybe one or two will cost you 100k-300k. With the other 1M you can buy several good weapons, to have many options, to be able to switch weapons around, surprise your opponent, adjust your set against his set, and so on. Again I repeat that Alex won the first L54 tournament with a 4M set.</p>
	<p><span class="faq">What about those crazy people that spend over 30M on L54?</span><br>There are indeed people that do that (such as myself). But this doesn't hurt the claim that L54 is a cheap league. The very-expensive L54 weapons are only <i>slightly better</i> in a few aspects, and work mainly as extra options. They can all be countered decently with cheap weapons. For example, it doesn't matter if a player spends over 50 million NPs on a Golden Butter Knife, if you can easily counter it with your Frozen Wave Scimitar.</p>
	<p><span class="faq">How is the L54 community like?</span><br>I will be the first to admit that I wish the L54 community was more active. But this is true to anything battledome-related. We all know it is very slow. But there are a few active L54 battlers, that will be willing to practice, and are very friendly. I am happy with the L54 community. Apart of the english-forums, there is also a very nice L54 community on the spanish forums!</p>
	<p><span class="faq">Is there an official L54 ranking?</span><br>Not yet. This is something I would like to organize in the future. I started keeping track of all L54 results some time ago, and hopefully I will organize a full ranking one day, if the community thinks it could be a good idea.</p>

	<hr><span class="subtitle"><b>BRIEF STRATEGY DISCUSSION</b> (Completely rewritten @ February 29, 2016)</span>

	<p>Now let's talk about the most fun thing here. The thoughts on L54 strategy. How to become a good battler? What are the basic strategies? What are the ideas behind a good L54 fight?</p>

	<p>First, let's think about the 54/13/35 build. The 13-strength-boost means that each attack icon corresponds to 1 attack damage. The 35-defense-boost means that each defense icon corresponds to blocking 1.5 damage. Therefore, two defense icons are enough to block three attack icons. This means that dual duties shine in this league. And they are very, very interesting. With 54 HP and the weapon restrictions, this makes L54 battles last around 10 to 12 rounds. The longest battle I ever played, with a lot of defense by both sides, took 16 rounds.</p>

	<p>Now let's establish the pivotal aspects of a L54 battle:</p>

	<ul><li><b>Aspect #1: Choosing a good set.</b> But what is a good set? If you know nothing about your opponent, a good set is a set that is well-prepared to react to the most common combos used in L54. Ask yourself questions like: what would be good to use against Frozen Wave Scimitar + Frozen Water Daggers + Static Cling? If you enter a battle with a bad set, maybe your opponent will catch you off-guard and simply use a combo that you cannot defeat.</li>
		<li><b>Aspect #2: Aiming for positive advantage.</b> You don't have to deal a lot of damage to your opponent - you just have to deal more damage than you take. That's why dual-duties are so important in L54. Keep in mind the defense boost is 1.5. The best way to have positive advantage in a turn is not simply by choosing good attack icon types (that avoids your opponent's defenses), but by choosing the precise dual-duties.</li>
		<li><b>Aspect #3: Having a good heal turn.</b> The strategy on heal turns is different than normal turns, because you will only have one weapon slot (the other slot will be occupied by the healer). <b>If joint-heal-turn</b> (both players healing in the same turn): You will try to have a positive advantage, keeping in mind that both you and your opponent will only use one weapoon (since the other is the healer). <b>If separate heal turn</b> (only you will heal): don't expect to have a positive advantage, since your opponent will be using two weapons, and you'll use only one; it is natural to have a negative advantage on that turn. But don't worry, because your opponent also has his heal turn, in which you (hopefully) will compensate for this. If your advantage on your separate heal turn is not worse than -12, you could say you had a good heal turn.</li>
		<li><b>Aspect #4: Choosing if you are going for a win or a draw.</b> When you see that the battle is close to the end, think if you have conditions of going for a win, or if it is better to try for a draw. The strategies are different for each of those. If you want to draw, you don't have to worry too much of taking damage, since you just want to bring your opponent down to 0 HP, and don't mind if you get down to 0 HP too. But if you are going for a win, which is a lot harder, you not only have to bring your opponent to 0 HP, but you also have to make sure you survive as well!! This means you probably won't simply use 10-iconers to get it over with, you will also have to try to defend yourself. Remember: most of the times, if you are going for a win, your opponent is going for a draw, or vice-versa.</li>
		<li><b>Aspect #5a: Observing your opponent.</b> Pay attention to what weapons and abilities he/she is using. If you see them use 7 different weapons, you already know his set completely (the 8th weapon is the healer). And you can use this in your favor, to see what combos he can't defend well.</li>
		<li><b>Aspect #5b: Keeping track of the abilities.</b> The abilities Shade and Meditate both have a cooldown of 4 rounds. This means you can pay attention to your opponent, observe when he will use his ability, and then keep in mind what is the turn of the battle in which that ability will be available for him. For example, if he uses Shade on the second turn, it will be available again only in the seventh turn. If you know this, you can take advantage of it.</li>

		<b>Halitosis</b> (Level 1)
		<p>» This ability attacks <img src="http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac33/hamsterpellet/earth.png"><img src="http://i883.photobucket.com/albums/ac33/hamsterpellet/earth.png"> on the turn it is used, and the same attack is repeated on the next turn.</p>
		<p>» It has a 2-turn cooldown, which means it will only be available again in the third turn after using it.</p>
		<p>» Example: let's say you use Halitosis on Turn 1. You will attack with 2 earth icons that turn. Then, on Turn 2, Halitosis will be on cooldown, so let's say you use Shade. So in Turn 2, you will Shade AND will attack with another 2 earth icons (this is Halitosis' repeated attack). In Turn 3, Halitosis still can't be selected because it is in cooldown. But in Turn 4, it will be available to be used again.</p>
		<p>» Discussion: let's compare this ability to Static Cling. If you use Halitosis as much as possible, you will be dealing 4 earth damage every 3 turns. This is an average of 1.67 earth icons per turn, while Static Cling obviously has an average of 3 light icons per turn. But why some people choose Halitosis? Because it attacks with earth, not light. Static Cling is expected almost every turn, so the other player most likely will try to block light. If you attack with earth instead, you will have a good time. Of course, the other player might be ready for this and choose to block earth instead. Therefore choosing between Cling and Halitosis is an important part of the strategy. Tournaments usually work with best-of-three matches, some players even like to switch between Cling and Halitosis between the fights.</p>

	<a name="fresh"></a><span class="subtitle"><b>FRESH-STARTERS SECTION</b></span>
	<p>The battledome can be very fun if you battle 2-player. You'll need strategy, to think wisely of every move you make. You'll have to decide if it's better to use a shield or attack with your full power. And such. Every turn is a mind game, when each player is trying to predict the other's moves.</p>
	<p>Don't be afraid. When I chose to start battling 2P, I was worried I might make other battlers angry, because I was terrible and didn't even know perfectly how things worked. I'm here now to tell you all, don't worry with that. We, battlers, are in general respectful players, who are just looking to have fun. Don't be afraid of battling with us. You'll probably lose your first battles, but that is part of the training, so you can become a better battler!</p>
	<p>It is recommended that you battle a bit in 1P first (if you didn't yet) just to get the hang of it. <a href="//www.neopets.com/dome/">Go to the battledome</a> and battle the 1P opponents, to see how the BD works. You'll have to get equipped with 8 weapons, that's called <i>your set</i>.</p>
	<p>You can always send me questions, or post in the boards for advice. <b>Anyone is welcome to try out L54.</b></p>
	<p>I also recommend reading Jellyneo's Beginner Guide to Battling, which can be found here:<br></p><center><span class="fakelink"><i>http://battlepedia.jellyneo.net/?go=beginners</i></span></center>
	<p><b><i>How exactly 2P works?</i></b> You will send a challenge to another player (or they will challenge you). After the challenged players accepts, the battle will start, and it will be just like battling 1P, except that your opponent is not automatically controlled, but is controlled by another person on the other side.</p>
	<p><b><i>How to get started?</i></b> Get a set (your set is the 8 weapons you have equipped for a battle). Then <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=10">post in BD Chat</a> that you're starting at L54 and want to practice. Hopefully a nice battler will send you a challenge :)</p>

	<p>The battledome sadly current has a lot of glitches/errors. A few of them are very irritating... While TNT doesn't address them, we have to try to survive. Here is a brief list:</p>

	<ul><li><b>Stealing glitch:</b> Stealers do not work<br></li>
		<li><b>Seeing/Foresight glitch:</b> There is a glitch that sometimes will let you see the weapons your opponent will use before you send your move!<br></li>
		<li><b>Freezing glitch:</b> Sometimes freezers won't work, depending on who clicked first.<br></li>
		<li><b><strike>Overhealing glitch:</strike></b> This was just a rumour. Some people claimed that their overhealer didn't overheal, just heal. But this is not the case - overheal is working properly.<br></li>
		<li>A few faerie abilities are glitched.<br></li>
		<li>A few weapons don't work as they should, regarding move order (such as Glowing Cauldron).<br></li>
		<li>Sometimes (rarely, but can happen) the battledome will send your move twice, i.e. you will use the same weapons in the next move, without having time to change them. This happens very rarely though, and is related to lag.<br></li>

		<li><b>Unequip glitch (Fixed!):</b> It was not possible to unequip any items!!<br></li>
		<li><b>Challenge Glitch (Fixed!):</b> After some 2P battles, players would become unable to send 2P challenges.<br></li>
