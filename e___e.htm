Since I do not have the time to update this page right now, <a>Garmfay</a> has given me this image that explains how it all works.  I will add a section better explaining it when I get time :)
<br><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/fryguyis/WC.gif"><br><br><a name="opening"><font size="6">Opening</font><p>
So, you think that you are the best?  Think that you can pwn up anyone at your favorite game?  Do you want to win stuff while you beat others at it?  Then the World Challenges are where you belong!!!  What is that?  You do not know what World Challenges are!?!?  Well, you have come to the right place!  I am going to explain to you how the World Challenges work, teach you tips and tricks, and make you a pwnified gamer.</p></a>  <br><br><a name="howtoparticipate"><font size="6">Getting Started</font><p>Where are the World Challenges located?  Well, I guess I will be nice, after all I am trying to help you learn all about them right?  So, the World Challenge's master headquarters are located <a>here</a>.  Now on to business, the first thing we are going to address is how to participate in the World Challenges.  It is very, very simple, so simple that you will be beating yourself up about it if you didn't know how!  First thing to look for is this nice little green button:
<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/challenges/world_challenge_button.gif" border="1"><br>
This button tells you which games have World Challenges available on them and which do not.  After you have found the game you wish to participate on, go into it's "World Challenge Center".  If you are stuck and can not figure out where the "World Challenge Center" is for a game, figure out the game ID by viewing image propertys of the game button.  Take that number and replace the ### in the following URL with that number:
<br>//www.neopets.com/challenges/world_chall_game_page.phtml?game_id=###
<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/error_title.gif" border="1"><br>When using this URL, if you get an error message, that means your game does not have a World Challenge or you entered the wrong ID. 
</p><p>Anyways, once you have gotten to the "World Challenge Center" for your game, you are going to want to click the link that says "Enter the Challenge!".  I have included an image just in case this link eludes you.
</p><p><img src="http://img1.yoxio.com/img/183851.gif" border="1"><br>A pop-up will appear as soon as you click that link.  This pop-up is making sure that you are aware that you are spending 100 NeoPoints to enter the competition.  If you do not wish to spend that 100 NeoPoints, you should probably leave this guide now.
</p><p>Once you pay your entry fee, you are ready for the next part of the guide.</p></a>
<p><a name="playing"><font size="6">Playing Your Game</font><p>Now, on to the fun part, playing the game you choose.  This step is even easier then the last step.  To participate in the World Challenge after you have paid your entry fee is just play the game, try to achieve a score high enough for your liking.  You will then be paired against another random Neopian and who ever has the most points, wins!
</p><p><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/petpet_robo_griefer.gif" border="1"></p><p>You may notice that on the game center for the game you choose to play, a little Robotic petpet speices name "Griefer".  I do not know if NeoPets has an official name for it or not, but I like to refer to it as Scratches.  Scratches is on the game center to make sure you know what competition hour you are entered in.  
</p><p>Sorry, I had to make sure you guys knew about Scratches so you aren't scared by him.  Back on subject, you will want to keep on playing your game for the whole entire hour!  You can probably stop if you are in first by a whole lot of wins, but you should always realize that some people are good at pulling tricks out of their hats and over throwing you.
</p><p>If you decide that the game you entered just isn't cutting it for you, you can easily enter another challenge in the same hour.  Just follow the exact same steps you did before to enter this new challenge.  You should probably not change challenges if you are heading into the 20th minutes of the challenges.  You are more likely not to be able to get enough wins if you come in later then that.</p><p>

<a name="agg"><font size="6">Aggravations</font><p>
There are only a few things so far that aggravate me about the World Challenges.  The first thing that aggravates me is the fact that you need 5 people to participate before map pieces and NeoPoints are awarded.  This is slightly less of an aggravation now that Neopets lowered the the amount of participants from 10.  None the less, this is still annoying.  Why does this aggravate me?  Well, I absolutely love the game <a>Raiders of Maraqua</a> (A.K.A. RoM) and it frustrates me because only around 2-3 people participate each hour!  With only 2-3 people, we can not get our map pieces.  </p><p>How can you fix this aggravation of mine?  First, whenever you see someone on the NeoBoards (most likely it will be in the <a>Games</a> board) asking for people to play in a certain game challenge, take an effort just to score 1 point in the game.  Sure you wasted 100 NeoPoints but you should be able to make back that 100 NeoPoints very easily in games.  </p><p>The second way I have for you is the way that I personally will do most of the time.  Set aside a certain amount of NeoPoints solely for helping people with World Challenges.  When it is somewhere between 30-40 minutes into the World Challenges, go around to random games which do not have enough participants and get just 1 point in the game.  People will greatly appreciate your help.  </p><p>Sometimes, games may have 1-2 players in it at the time you do your kind deed, so you may think, "What good am I doing them?" This is what you are doing for them, you are attracting the "traveling gamers".  What is the definition of "traveling gamers"?  Basically, what I mean by this is they tend to go from game to game trying to find games with almost enough participants, and try to stomp them.  This is an easy trade, because the less participants usually means you need fewer wins to get first.
</p><p>The second thing is cheaters.  Yes, even World Challenges has it's far share of cheaters.  How do they cheat?  Simple, they create accounts just so they will get a map.  They will create accounts and keep entering, making the participation appear to go up, and make more map piece winners.  This may not seem bad, but 95% of the time, they are the winners of the map pieces.  A very easy way to spot cheaters is usernames.  Most cheaters will type either numbers or the same type of username.  An example is cp123343, cp3497302, cp3402830, and such.  I do not know if this is a punishable offence or not, if it isn't, it should.  You can try <a>reporting</a> them with the reason of cheating.</p></a>

</p><p><a name="win"><font size="6">Winning</font><p>
Ah, so now you want to know how to win and what you get from winning.  As you probably can guess, the first way of winning is to get more wins in the game(s) than anyone else.    </p><p>That is the very basic way, but some people follow a way I call, "playing the scores".  When World Challenges first came out on NeoPets, the only way to win prizes was to get the most wins, but now NeoPets has a new feature to the World Challenges!  The new feature is for you to achieve a score higher then anyone else in the hour.  I have placed an example of how it looks on the games World Challenge page.
</p><p><img src="http://img1.yoxio.com/img/183892.gif" border="1"></p><p>
I have tested out personally how it works if you have the highscore and win first or second place with enough participants. (Thanks to Ghost and Matt for helping).  NeoPets will send you one NeoMail saying you won because you were in the top positions or they will send you a neomail saying that you got the highest score in the game.  For some reason, everytime I have achieved the highest score, the "new Neomail" icon does not show up.  The Neomail is in my inbox but I do not get a notifcation...
</p><p><a name="tips"><font size="6">Tips &amp; Tricks</font><p>
</p><li>Always begin playing before the hour.  Be ready to send your score as soon as the new hour begins.  This will help you get at least 1 more chance at a win then if you started at the beginning of the hour.  <b>NOTE!: Be sure you pay your new hour entry fee before you send your score!</b>
<p></p></li><li>Learn when is the best time to play your game(s).  Almost every game gets enough participants every now and then, your objective is to figure out when is the best time of day to play your game.  Another good thing to learn is what is a good score to send and win.  Some games you can spend hours getting points, but really you only need a certain amount in World Challenges to win 90% of the time.
<p></p></li><li>Get your Neofriends/Guild mates to participate in the challenges with you.  This will help you get your 10 participants and will let you win map pieces.
<p></p></li><li>Learn your game(s).  Do not just go blindly playing games that you know nothing about.  Learn trades and secrets of your game(s).  The site I use for game help has hundred of games and is always adding.  You can visit that site <a>here</a>.
<p></p></li><li>The more people who play, the more prizes are given out.  Here are the landmarks that I am sure of.
<br>5 players equals the top 3 getting maps.
<br>50 players equals the top 15 getting maps.
<br>More analyzation is needed for the other landmarks.
<p></p></li><li>Stop while you are ahead.  I have been known to try to go for too much and end up with nothing.  Learn when enough is enough.
