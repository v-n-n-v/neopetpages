	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	This is my guide to avatar games that aren't purely luck-based, like the Wheel avatars or the Lottery. The advice on here is from people who have the avatar, and/or trophy, and from JellyNeo's game guides. While I do include things from JN's game guides, and link to them, the tips here are generally things other people and I have discovered that are not on those guides.
	<br><br>If you have any advice for any of the avatar games, please feel free to <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=t0tor0">Neomail me</a>!
	<br><br>Blanket advice for improving at a game: make it a daily. That is, when you have time to play games here and send scores, send your 3 scores for the game you want to get better at. You <b>will</b> improve over time. You don't have to play a lot each day, but it's that daily practice that gives you practical and intellectual knowledge of what will happen, what works, and what doesn't.
	<br><br>A great resource is the Neopian Times. There a bunch of guides for every game on there, and by experts.
	<br><br>You can also ask for help on the <a href="/neoboards/index.phtml">Neoboards</a>. I recommend the <a href="/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=23">Games</a> and the <a href="/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=21">Avatars/NeoSignatures</a> boards. Of course, I especially recommend the <a href="/~Baila">Friendly Neopian Lending Board (FNLB)</a>, which is on the <a href="/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=21">Avatar Chat</a>.
	<br><br><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The 2019 Charity Corner (CC) perk, More for Less (MFL), decreases the score needed for each Flash game avatar (though Shockwave games are excluded) to 80% of the normal score. I recommend getting an 80%+ score for one or more games and then activating the perk and sending the score/s. More information here:
	<span class="center">www.jellyneo.net/?go=charity_corner&amp;id=2019_prizes</span></span>
	<br>The above information is now irrelevant as the 2019 Charity Corner (CC) perk shop has closed and did not reopen in 2020. This may become relevant again in 2021 but <i>will we even get a perk shop in Charity Corner 2021, if we get one at all? Will there <b>be</b> a game perk if there IS a perk shop, given that Flash is supposed to be dead?</i>
	<br><br>I may include sections with advice for non-avatar games that I am good at at some point, such as Sophie's Stew. Hopefully this will help some people get trophies in those games.	
	<br><br>10/8/2021: Removed all images because TNT broke embedding Neopets server images somehow in the move to HTML5...and then reverted because the issue was fixed.
	<br><br>21/1/2021: added a few other Flash workarounds.
	<br><br>13/1/2021: Finished adding all avatar games.
	<br><br>12/1/2021: added Flash workarounds.

	This is very similar to the Flash game <a href="/games/game.phtml?game_id=1146">Slorgs in Space</a>, which makes sense, because it's subtitled "Attack of the Slorgs II".
	<br><br>Actually <a href="/~Baerrita">getting Shockwave to work</a> is much harder than this game--just get some practice in and familiarise yourself with the powerups, and you should be fine.

	Each level has randomly generated coin values (5, 10, or 25). If you're going for a trophy, note that it might take you several tries to get a sufficiently high score for gold. The upside is that since Shockwave is such a pain to get working, you don't have to deal with much competition.

	<ul><li>Use JN's guide for the hidden gems, following the instructions exactly. For instance, in level 5, <i>don't</i> try and get the life before getting the boulder down, because you only have one shot at getting it.</li>
	<li>If you want the avatar and/or trophy, play ALL the levels, including the tutorial levels, because they award a fair amount of points that do count--you can be close to halfway to the avatar score by the time you reach level 1.</li>
	<li>Practise levels you have trouble with. Once you unlock a level, you can skip straight to it, although for your final score-sending run, start from Tutorial 1.</li>
	<li>Extra lives disappear from the level once you grab them even if you restart the level. You'd need to restart the game for them to reappear.</li>
	</ul>
	This is very similar to <a href="/games/game.phtml?game_id=473">Hannah and the Ice Caves</a>, although that game has the added character of Armin the Small, who has different abilities to Hannah and can barely swim (he survives for maybe a few seconds underwater). If you can get this avatar, you can probably also get a trophy if you play at the start of the month. Once you get the hang of this game, try out the Ice Caves for an easy trophy--even fewer people play it because it's both a Shockwave game and doesn't award an avatar.

	Dive to either side (pick one) consistently to help avoid obstacles. More expensive cheeses have a greater chance of rolling faster. (I go with the most expensive, the Rotten Cheese.) Being mostly luck-based, this is a good game to try for a trophy even after you get the avatar. Like with Flash games, you get 3 rolls a day.

	The tournament level is irrelevant for the avatar. People generally get it around level 11 - 12, though.
	<br><br>*Since the images on James's guide are broken, in order to read the guide, you need to select all (Ctrl+A). If you're on a phone, it's a tad trickier, so I recommend reading the guide on a PC. However, the main strategy is shown in the "strategy" section in an image (the numbers show the order of playing pieces). While it's watermarked, you can see what's going on (it's fortunately not blurred out). The backwards tick thing works most of the time, but not always, and in tournament 11 and beyond, the board will no longer start with 4 pieces already on it.

	<ul><li>Play on slow mode until you get the hang of all the cards and scoring sets.</li>
	<li>I generally go for the starred cards (lands) first, and then the flying petpets and various flag combos.</li>
	<li>Capture cards already on the table before capturing cards given in your hand.</li>
	<li>Since each land has 4 cards, it can sometimes be better to hold off on playing a card from that land until one pair has been captured. Then you can guarantee that if the next-drawn card fom the deck will not give you a 3rd card from that land and giving the opponent a chance to collect all 4 cards.</li>
	<li>If you have 2 cards from 1 land, this is what I call "backup", in that you don't have to worry about a 3rd card being drawn, because you can then play the second card and capture all 4.</li>
	<li>Though the "world" and non-flying petpet cards can award points if you have more than 10 or 5 respectively, they are the least valuable overall. These are the cards you play first if there is nothing to valuable to capture on the table and you are starting a new land pile.</li>
	<li>I call it "burning" a card if you ditch it with no plans to capture it later.</li>
	<li>If you have 3 cards from 1 land, wait until the 4th card shows up, or alternatively play it if you're out of cards to "burn" to see if you draw the 4th. If you don't, and your pet doesn't immediately play the 4th card, then you capture it with another card and continue waiting.</li>
	<li>If you have all the remaining cards for a land that's been dealt, e.g. the last card of a 3-card pile, play them last or when you want to hold onto your other cards to capture specific cards. You are guaranteed all 4 cards, so there is no rush to grab them.</li>
	<li>Burn the world, HW flag (not part of any set), and non-flying petpet cards first if you don't see anything worth capturing. These cards are most useful in capturing other cards from their world.</li>
	<li>Godori works on your phone, though it occasionally needs a refresh if it gets too laggy.</li>

	Since any score above 5 900 requires a review, there are two ways to get the Top 50 avatar:
	<ul><li>you can try and get all 4 Mortogs correct as early as possible on 1st (since whoever gets the score first is higher), or </li>
	<li>wait until the last day and try and get 5 Mortogs right and collect 35 000 NP, hoping you get reviewed on the 1st in time for high score awarding.</li>
	</ul>
	I recommend the first, because it's a lot easier to get 4 Mortogs correct than 5, and also it allows people to "bump" you off the high score table once enough people score 5 900. However, not many people play anymore and it's rare to be bumped off if you're too far below 50th place.
	<br><br>If you time it correctly and are lucky, you can potentially get both avatars at once.

	I have this avatar after following the JN guide as well as the linked guide I found in the NT. It does take a bit of practice, and knowing where the secret areas are really helps! You can get the avatar without defeating the boss, but you do have to get a fair way through the game--I got it on the last level before the boss. It's possible to get it by the end of Act 1 of Kreludor, but if you're that good you probably already have the avatar.
	<br><br>*Something to note that isn't mentioned on JN or any of the guides I could find: if you lose a life, your air bonus is cut in half. Or, at least, you lose 400 points. If you lose a second life, you lose more points. I'm not sure on the maths, exactly, and I've only tested it on level 1. So ideally you'll want to get levels done without losing lives (or taking damage).	
	<br><br>The one time you should deliberately take damage? Wuba Secundus, Act 1. After dropping down to get the force field, getting past the checkpoint, there are no more gross foods to get. However, your gravity boots will give you trouble trying to go back left to get the bottom Nerkmids (if you drop down from the left and go right, you can't get the vertical line of Nerkmids). So at some point, if you haven't already lost the boots, lose them by getting hit--but in a safe spot! I recommend hitting one of the red slug-like enemies, in a spot where you won't get knocked into thin air--like a spot where there's a nice, safe wall, for instance. Then you can finish the level easily (to get past that orange swirly thing, either duck the blast, jump over it, or jump back onto the other platform to move out of range, depending on where you first activate it).

	<ul><li>Basically, you can't play without a strategy and hope to get lucky. You have to find what works for you (gets you your highest scores) and practice that.</li>
	<li>Also, when you have the x3 multiplier, definitely try to delete as many blocks of other colors as possible. This increases your chances of gathering more of the multiplier colored blocks together, and, if you are unlucky and there aren't many together, it's worth using the reshuffling tile to try to make that bonus as big as possible ^_^</li>
	</ul><div class="credit">~<a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=cristalblue692">Tina</a></div>
	My own tips:
	<ul><li>Restart until you get a reshuffler block in level 1, or occasionally I'll try with an overki<i></i>ll + fill block because you can get it down to one/two colours left and clear the entire level, but not always.</li>
	<li>Once you get that reshuffler block, don't use it until you get another reshuffler block. Then clear all colours except the reshuffler block's colour (and, if you get a multiplier block, don't clear any blocks of that colour either unless you manage to get a great combo with most of that colour's blocks, in which case use the multiplier in the first round), then activate the reshuffler. Unless it's a really rare colour, most of the time you will be able to get the reshuffler power-up again in the new randomised setup. I have had this fail before though, where the reshuffler/multiplier block will be unusable (or the multiplier will show up in a spot where you can only connect fewer blocks than you could before the shuffle, which is annoying), even with a dominant colour, so it is a bit of a risk.</li>
	<li>The level with the brown blocks (260 points to pass) is where I got the avatar, although I didn't finish the level.</li>
	<li>You need a healthy dose of luck in multiplier blocks with dominant colours to get bonuses as well as enough reshuffler blocks to use and clear the most blocks possible each level. It's a bit like Spacerocked, Feed Florg, and Typing Terror--if you play enough games, eventually you'll get good enough and lucky enough to get that score.</li>

	My only tip is to select the large game size and zoom in as much as you can while keeping the whole game screen visible. Ken's guide says to count in twos ahead of potatoes appearing, which is great, but by levels 8 and 9 I was counting in 5s, incrementing every second or two without properly counting the mass of flying potatoes. Then I took an educated guess. You'll need to get past level 8, 9, or 10 for an avatar-eligible score, potentially level 7, 8, or 9 if you get lucky with correctly guessed higher potato counts and also use the MFL perk. I needed MFL for this one.

	Every level on the game has a set configuration of bubbles, but each time you play, the elements will change. That is, the bubbles will form the same pattern, but in different colours (elements). JN's guide has screenshots. You may not get the same exact level as they have shown, but you will get the same pattern as shown.
	<ul><li>When you get bubbles you don't need, fire them so they don't hit the very top. Instead, get them to stick to bubbles from below so that when the pre-existing bubbles fall, the extra ones fall too.</li>
		<li>Ricocheting bubbles from the sides of the screen can be very useful. In level 18, if you have the same element bubble as the highest 2-bubble layer, or a Nova bubble (you can get one by typing <b>stardust</b>), you can beat the level with one shot if you aim it correctly and it ricochets off the side and right next to that top layer.</li>
		<li>Do your best to avoid activating the Dark, Earth, and Air combos (although in cases where they're only on one line, Air combos aren't always bad, and Dark is preferable to Earth). Light is a bit of a wildcard; you don't know if it'll give you a good element or bad one (or make no difference) …sometimes it's not worth the risk.</li>
		<li>Activate Water and Fire whenever possible (though water is immune to fire), and before Light where possible. <br>For instance, in JN's guide, in the level 8 screenshot given, I often go:
			<ol><li>activate a fire combo using the fire closest to the cannon, on the right (aim the Fire between the Dark and existing fire, then between the left Dark and Water, and then in the middle of those two to burn away chances of activating a Dark combo), </li>
				<li>activate the water combo (order here doesn't matter much), then </li>
				<li>do a light combo and eliminate the rest.</li>
			</ol></li><li>If you need to activate an Air combo, do it ASAP to give yourself time to deal with the generated bubbles.</li>
		<li>Save the <b>slumberberry</b> powerup for level 14 (or later).</li>
		<li>In level 12 and 13, if you have a Water layer in the layer at the top (furthest from you) or middle, where possible, try activate a Water combo without even activating the layer closest to you. Then the rest of the bubbles below will fall.</li>
		<li>Incidentally, levels 12, 13, and 18 are the easiest places to deal with Air combos. Since they cover the entire width of the screen, activating them takes everything below them down with them with no extra bubbles you have to deal with.</li>
		<li>In levels 12 and 13, Dark isn't too bad unless it's on the very top layer, because then you do have to eliminate all the bubbles without the higher layer's combo activating.</li>
		<li>In level 18, if you get a configuration with a Dark line in the 2nd highest layer (like in JN's guide screenshot), try not to activate it. Use ricochet instead to try and hit a Nova or relevant element bubble to hit the topmost layer.</li>
		<li>I generally beat level 15 with <b>bubbles</b> (and sometimes throw in <b>faerieland</b> for a one-shot win), but occasionally it's mean and gives you a dark combo -_-</li>
		<li>The <b>slumberberry</b> powerup is most useful in level 20.</li>
		<li>If you have trouble aiming, get something with a straight edge like a ruler and put it against the screen to help line up your shot.</li>
		<li>Restart level 1 until you get a configuration which is mostly Fire, Water, Light, or occasionally, Air (because if you get the bubbles and eliminate the other element on one side, you can activate Air so it's only on one line and thus eliminate most of the bubbles)</li>
		<li>Level 4's most common pattern seems to be the one shown on JN's guide. What I do here is aim a Fire bubble so you get it between the dark and light bubbles on the left or right. So the line closest to you will be: Fire, Fire, blank, Fire, Fire. Then aim another Fire bubble into that gap, which activates the Fire combo and eliminates the need to activate the Dark combo.</li>
		<li>Note that once you get to level 20, even if you lose, you'll get a 300-point bonus, so if you get there you might already be eligible for the avatar.</li>

	Let me start by admitting there is definitely some luck involved in getting past later levels. The blobs can be kind and they can be cruel. But with some patience, practice, and a little luck, you can get the avatar.
	<br><br>All toys come in different colours, and there are 3 tiers of colours: Primary (red, blue, and yellow), Secondary (purple, green, and orange), and Rainbow. The higher the tier, the higher the points. JN's guide explains in more detail. A toy can range from 1 - 15 points.
	<ul><li>The best way to increase your points is to make consecutive chains of toys as long as possible.</li>
		<li>Try to finish levels as quickly as possible for the time bonus.</li>
		<li>There is a slight delay between filling the vats and the paint disappearing. This <i>is</i> enough time to overfill your vat or put in an incorrect/evil blob, which means you have to refill the vat. If you want to refill your vat right after putting in a blob (which is good for chains), wait until the paint has disappeared before clicking the next blob.</li>
		<li>If there are no toys on the belt, wait until you get the required blobs into the vats before clicking on the Grundo Thief. You get maximum Thief-free time this way. If you miss the vat, the Thief might be in the right spot to save you some overflow and get whacked down.</li>
		<li>You'll learn to judge the best time to click a blob with experience. Note that faster blobs travel further forward before hitting the vat, so click accordingly. Ignore blobs going too fast to get into their vat.</li>
		<li>The crucial levels are levels 6 and 7. If you're lucky, you can get the avatar on level 7, but if you're not, you might only qualify on level 8.</li>
	</ul>
	You can see a list of the blob types on JN, along with pictures. Ranking the good blobs from most to least useful:
	<ol><li><b>Atomic:</b> I've only seen this in level 7 and beyond. Fills up all vats. Excellent!</li>
		<li><b>Angel:</b> fills up whichever vat it falls into. Will give you 1 bonus point if it lands on a toy that gets processed.</li>
		<li><b>Time:</b> adds 5 seconds to the timer.</li>
		<li><b>Soap:</b> decreases waste metre by 20%, though it's useless if you have no waste.</li>
		<li><b>Winged:</b> temporarily raises speed of conveyor belt. Can add to a chain, but can also break a chain once the toys slow back down. Use at your own discretion.</li>
		<li><b>Glowing:</b> raises the tier of all toys on the belt (e.g. a blue toy will become a secondary colour, and an orange toy will become rainbow).</li>
		<li><b>Normal:</b> good when in the right vat. Will also whack the Grundo Thief back down if it falls on him.</li>
	</ol>
	Ranking the bad blobs from worst to mildly annoying:
	<ol><li><b>Evil:</b> empties whichever vat it's dropped in and adds to your waste metre. It's hardest to spot if it's the blue tiniest blob, so check all of those for little white dots (the grinning mouth). No white dots means it's normal. If it falls on a toy on the conveyor belt, it destroys it and that toy will not be processed.</li>
		<li><b>Gigantic:</b> fills up most of the screen, and if dropped into the right vat, completely fills it but also adds to your waste metre. Could be worth it if you're pressed for time, but usually isn't.</li>
		<li><b>Ice:</b> temporarily slows down the conveyor belt. Potentially useful for lengthening chains but very rarely.</li>
		<li><b>Normal:</b> if it misses and hits a toy on the belt, turns it into that colour (bad if it's a secondary/rainbow toy). Adds to waste if it misses and doesn't hit a toy.</li>
	</ol>
	Here are my rough point ranges that I normally get after each level (if I reach it). If you score below the lower limit, restart. If you score above the upper limit, good job!
	<ol><li>100 - 150+</li>
		<li>200 - 300+</li>
		<li>400 - 450+</li>
		<li>550 - 650+</li>
		<li>700 - 800+</li>
		<li>900 - 1100+</li>
		<li>1150 - 1250+</li>

		<li>1500 - 1650+</li>

		<li>Since speed and size scoop effects get reset when you activate a bonus scoop that's not a speed/size scoop, it's up to you whether it's worth it. Extra lives are always worth it, but in later games you might want to hang on to a smaller Adee over getting a few seconds' shielding or extra points. I'd say the Ollie scoop is always worth it; it's worth 1000 points. It's very rare, though. I've only seen it a few times.</li>
		<li>Only activate the Strawberry Bomb if you're in a tight spot, and/or there are too many normal scoops on the screen (you want those multipliers!) and it's a fairly easy level. It clears the screen, but you don't get any of the points from the scoops it cleared, and lengthens the level. It's useful for a quick breather in later levels too.</li>
		<li>If you're in a tight spot, move your mouse to the top (bottom if playing converted version) and out of the game screen, and then back in another spot. Depending on the scoop spread, it may save you a life. Sometimes you end up popping back into an unsafe spot, though, because in these situations there isn't much time to plan your escape route. Worth a shot, but it's not a guaranteed save.</li>
		<li>I always do this, but I can't say for sure if it works: at the start of the game, type in the life code, and leave the game screen inactive (you can go do something else) for a few minutes. Ollie will replace Adee. Some say it increases your chances of getting bonus scoops. Can't hurt, right?</li>

	I needed MFL for this one--I have a high score of 2370, but I can fairly regularly break 2k now. The guides can only help so much. I didn't bother with any shenanigans with zooming (zooming out means less distance to move pets and zooming in means less chance of overlapping petpets, which is probably the #1 cause of losing lives once you get better at the game). Nor did I end up using the grouping tactic that Stephanie advocates.
	<br><br>The main tip I can suggest is to restart until you get a petpet going fast enough to knock something over before needing assistance so you can use the mop. I generally use the mop until ~800+ points, after which point it's difficult to catch a break long enough to use it.

	The NT guides I found above seem to be the most helpful. There is a distinct element of luck in the number of bonus bubbles, gold pieces, and lives you get. You can get to level 19 (I never broke level 19; I have no idea how to solve it honestly--it's chaos) and still not be avatar-eligible. Always defeat the maximum number of enemies per level, except for level 8, because respawns may sabotage vital bubbles. After defeating the max, sometimes it's worth sticking around and defeating more once you've positioned the last treasure within one move of the chest. This is mainly to try and get bonus bubbles, which get progressively more valuable in the later levels. That's what I spend level 19 doing.

	If you press the up arrow, it slows the snowball down. If you press the down arrow, it speeds it up. You want to press the up arrow all the time, but know that it does not always work. Sometimes it will work at the start, and then you get a random item or get hit and suddenly it will stop working. The black slushie (super traction) almost always makes the up arrow lose its effect. The ice slick (whoops, skidding) also usually removes the up arrow's effect. Same with the yellow paint slick. If you are on the very last stage, 3-2, and you have the game slowed down, you might want to <b>avoid all black slushies</b>. Fortunately, with the game slowed right down, you essentially get all items once you hit 100%, and jumping over all obstacles is easy enough at that slow speed.

	Full guide by Lily (pregnatress) <a href="/ntimes/index.phtml?section=581659&amp;week=906">here</a>. The main tip I picked up from it was that the extra life code isn't really helpful unless you end up dying before collecting the max number of gems (470+ points if you play it right) in later attempts. The guide mentioned that it might even be better not to activate the code, since it <b>might</b> actually give you more fireball<i></i>s. I'd rather not risk it. I got the avatar not long after I stopped doing this, but I can't confirm or deny the rumour for sure. Other tips are in the JN guide.
	<br><br>Crucial tips:
	<ul><li>The first attempt is vital to get the maximum distance: ~1 030+ or 730+ if you've got the Charity Corner perk activated. If you don't get up to that before losing a life, keep restarting the game until you do.</li>
		<li>Avoid gems in the first life because once you run past 450 they're replaced by fireball<i></i>s. Of course if it's the best/only way to avoid a fireball, go for the gems.
		Once you get the distance, go for the gems. Once you get to 400 bonus points, try to arrange it so you only get 440 and then you can get a trio of gems (or if lucky, two trios and/or red gems which are worth more) to get 470+ bonus.</li>
		<li>Fireball<i></i>s either come in pairs in wider spaces or alone with gems. Often the best way to avoid the pairs is to go between them, but sometimes going over/under both is best if they're too close together.</li>
		<li>The geysers aren't too bad; just speed past them with <b>v</b> once they fire.</li>
		<li>If you have a choice to go under or over, go under, because it's faster to click to make Glubgar fly higher than to wait for him to sink lower on his own.</li>
