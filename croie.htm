Most questions are answered in the guides. The Helpers on this board are happy to answer questions but PLEASE read the guide first.<br><br>

EVERYONE should be polite. It might take a few minutes before someone can answer your post. We have games to monitor and lives to live, too.<br><br><br><font color="red"><b>Post 4:</b></font><br><br> PT takes place in real time over a month. It always ends at 11:59pm NST on the last day of the month. Prizes are usually awarded and the new game starts on the 2nd.<br><br>

DO NOT USE the Refresh or Back buttons during your PT game. You can double pay for something that way.<br><br>

Please DO NOT post plushie names. It can make the prices drop.
<br><br><br><font color="red"><b>Post 5:</b></font><br><br>
DO NOT answer other new players' questions if you are a beginner yourself. Leave the helping to the experienced helpers. Giving wrong or inaccurate advice may ruin another player's game.<br><br>

KNOWN GLITCHES<br>
Nimmos often cause all plushies in your store to be invisible. They still sell, but you can only see them on your front page.<br><br> 
Meeting taxman with over 50 million COH *WILL* crash your game.
