        <p><font color="#0000A0" size="4">Later in the month, during "Trophy Run" you may see two different Bet tables. This is because, for high score purposes, ANY return helps your score.  Therefore, I'll make bets that I expect to lose neopoints on but that should yield some return in order to boost your score. For example, a return of 6:10, while losing nps in terms of profit/loss, would add 44,000 to the score of someone with a 10 year old account if they bet the maximum.<p>
My general approach: <br>
I, personally, rarely let the Food Adjustments sway me. I figure they are usually calculated into opening odds anyway. I'm more of an odds-based bettor than anything. I usually don't cover multiple upset possibilities anymore, outside of the occasional pyramid pattern, but I'm still not afraid to skip days if the risk/reward factor seems out of whack to me...guess you could say I'm pretty conservative...I think.  LoL</p>
<p>
Lifetime ROI* (Return on Investment) = 1.834 as of Jun 2nd, 2023<br><font size="2">*Lifetime ROI is calculated as Win Total / Bet Total in my Bet History so includes returns on days I've advised skipping, both positive and negative, as well as returns where I've messed up my personal bets but corrected them for the page.</font></p></font></p></td></tr></table></center><center>

<table width="900"><tr align="center"><td>
<p>Trophies are usually awarded at 11:50 NST during Daylight Savings Time but I <b>think</b> that due to it being Standard time right now, they are being awarded at 10:50 NST instead.</p>

<p>Your score in Food Club is the amount of winnings you collect at one time. You can hold 8 <b>consecutive</b> rounds worth. So if you start holding on Round 5000, then you'll have to collect after the results for Round 5007 and before 10:50/11:50pm NST in order to get it posted for that day's trophy awarding. Also, if you wait until after midnight NST, your winnings on Round 5000 will disappear completely. That may not be a bad thing. If you only won a minimal amount (or nothing) on Round 5000 and Round 5008 looks promising, you could intentionally give up Round 5000 earnings in order to try to move up.</p>

<p>While I often reference Trophy Run, it is <b>not</b> the sole means of acquiring a trophy, it's just generally the easiest time since that's when the scores are reset.</p>

<p>You'll see me talking about Holds, that is what you do when trying for a trophy: you Hold your winnings rather than collecting them. Outside of Trophy Run, I generally recommend starting a Hold when you get a good return, say 40:10 or better, and see how the next few days go. If there is a tank or low return, go on and collect and hope for another Hold later.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, also, that you don't <b>have</b> to wait for all 8 rounds before collecting. Let's say you've got 7 rounds worth being held, you're on at 10:45pm NST, and see that if you collect you'd get a trophy (or trophy upgrade), why not go ahead and do it? You could worry about upgrading later and it saves you from the chance of others getting a better return on that 8th day and knocking you out of that spot.</p>

<p>When going for a trophy on the usual Trophy Run, keep in mind that account age plays a <b>huge</b> factor in determining your success, especially if you are following a bet page.  Consider: if 50 people are all using the exact same bets and those bets happen to have the best return, then unless your account is older than 17 of the ones that are holding for the trophy, you won't score enough to make trophy level.</p>

<p>This is a perfect example of what I mean when I say even a 6:10 day, to a 10 year old account, can make a difference. Notice that the additional 44k a 6:10 would give was the difference in both Bronze and Silver <b>and</b> Bronze or no trophy at all!<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3tAgPBC.jpg"></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#0000A0" size="4">In terms of timing, what is considered the "Trophy Run" is when your 8th bet falls after scores have been reset on the 1st of the month. For example, November 24th is day 1 of Trophy Run for the December reset. If you're going to try for the trophy then, make sure to collect after the results of November 23rd but before 4:00 PM NST on the 24th, then collect again <b>after</b> the results on December 1st (~4:15 PM NST) and <b>before</b> 10:50 PM NST!
