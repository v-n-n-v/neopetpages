<h1>Petpet Protection League: Neopia's Forgotten, Glitchy Mess of a contest</h1>
<h2>Introduction... <i>With guest appearance by famous conspiracy theorist <strong>Jindarako</strong></i>
</h2><table width="100%"><tr><td width="12%">
<img src="http://imgur.com/3ottE5C.png" style="max-width: 78%;"></td>
<td width="90%">
Deep within the magical land of Neopia, in the heart of Neopia Central, lies the headquarters of the Petpet Protection League, an international organization devoted to the welfare of Petpet kind. At the helm of this league stands Weltrude, a supposedly kind-hearted Cloud Bruce who works tirelessly alongside other league members to celebrate Neopets who have proven themselves as exemplary petpet owners.
<br><br>

Neopets who have taken care of the same Petpet for an exceptionally long time are granted the opportunity to showcase their devotion to their furry, feathered, or scaly companions through the form of <b>PPL Trophies</b>. Normally, Neopets who are rewarded with this honor receive one single trophy for their efforts, which they proudly display on their petlookups. Once a petpet has been chosen for the PPL, that same petpet can never win again.</td>


</tr></table><p>But, alas, with so many Neopets to honor, the Petpet Protection League has not been immune to its fair share of so-called "mishaps." Throughout its history, the PPL has encountered a series of perplexing, unexplained glitches.<br><br></p><table width="100%"><tr><td width="60%" valign="top" style="padding-right: 25px;">

<i><strong>Jinda:</strong> And we're not just talking about a few glitches here, folks–we're talking <b>57 separate instances</b> of unexplained, glitched rounds! And get this - instead of receiving one trophy, as intended, some winners were awarded as many as <b>NINE</b> trophies. <b>NINE</b>, people! What kind of organization does that?</i><br><br><br>

In addition to divvying out random amounts of trophies to seemingly random winners, Weltrude has also been known to mix up the types of trophies that Neopets have earned, with some receiving Participation trophies instead of the Bronze trophies they deserved.<br><br><i><strong>Jinda:</strong> What kind of sick game are they playing here?</i><br><br><br>

While the league claims these are simply technical errors, some speculate that there's a deeper conspiracy at work.<br><br><br><i><strong>Jinda:</strong> Could it be that the Petpet Protection League is intentionally awarding these excess trophies to certain winners, perhaps as part of a grand scheme to control and manipulate the Neopian petpet market? Or is it a way to curry favor with certain powerful Neopets? <b>Is that sweet looking cloud bruce hiding something darker under the surface?</b> It's time to demand answers, folks. We can't let this go on any longer. <b>The truth must come out.</b></i><br><br></td><td width="40%" style="vertical-align: top;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/rCTYxTz.gif" style="max-width: 100%; width: 400px; height: auto;"></td></tr></table><h2>Why and how did you create this project?</h2> 

<p>Idk lol. Numbers make brain go brrrrrrrr…<br><br>

…<br><br></p><table width="100%"><tr><td width="80%" style="padding-right: 20px;">
      <p>Sorry lol. I became interested in the glitch after coming back from a 7-year hiatus to find two silver PPL trophies on my Mutant Draik, <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=Elukiar">Elukiar</a>. I hatched Elukiar myself, and attached her first and only petpet, a Mutant Dragoyle named Avira.<br><br></p>
      <p>At first, I thought it was a coding error, some remnant of 7-year-old CSS, but after deleting her pet description, I found that was not the case. But that couldn't be right–Elukiar had only ever owned Avira!<br><br></p>
    </td>
     <td width="20%" style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="http://imgur.com/Xk5RPen.png" style="max-width: 20%;"><img src="http://imgur.com/wDPKvQK.png" style="max-width: 200px;"><img src="http://imgur.com/Xk5RPen.png" style="max-width: 20%;"></td>
  </tr></table><p>She had received glitched trophies!<br><br>

I've always had a fascination with glitches. As a kiddo, I was constantly trying to look up and find new ones. From intentionally jumping out of bounds in Sonic Adventure 2: Battle, to trying to glitch Missingno and Bad Eggs into my Pokemon games, I've always been charmed by their existence. So when I found out Elukiar possessed glitched PPL trophies, I simply had to know more!<br><br>

I set out to investigate and came across <a href="/~Darkiro">Neopian Antiques and Oddities</a> and <a href="/~Actuality">The Glitch Index</a>, which both informed me there were others who had the exact experience! It was known as the PPL Glitch, and, unfortunately, there was no way to prove it existed.<br><br>

You see, unlike Neopia's other contests, the Petpet Protection League has never revealed the names of users or Neopets who have won. The only information we're given is the petpet's name and age. Which… was a pretty big roadblock in my quest for information.<br><br>

But thanks to a friendly neighborhood informant, I was provided a list of all <b>2,867 pets</b> who had ever received more than one trophy on the same date, as well as the dates they received these trophies.<br><br>

Armed with a massive list and aided by my trusty best neofriend, <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=jokirs">Keagan</a>, we set about the process of organizing, categorizing, ánalyzing, and interpreting the data.<br><br>

When I set out to research the PPL, it surprised me how little information there was on the subject. I don't want this unique little contest to get swept under the rug and forgotten. I've found so many fascinating tidbits while researching this glitch, and I'm hoping it will breathe some new life into this dusty ol' part of the site.<br><br>

This was originally going to be a simple PPL directory to display some of the glitched winners, but the more Keagan and I dug into the topic, the more interesting tidbits, trends, and changes to the contest we discovered. When I was able to trade for <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=jindarako">Jindarako</a>, a bizarre glitched winner with 8 PPL trophies from his Sklyde (WHO WAS STILL ATTACHED! ;0;), I knew I had the perfect place to put all the information<br><br>

I hope you guys get as excited about the strangeness as I have, and that you enjoy this tiny rabbit hole of Neopets history.

<h1>The <span style="color: #f69094;">Red</span> Weeks <strong>June 11th, 2003-July 21st, 2004</strong></h1>
<h2>The Very First PPL</h2>
The Petpet Protection League <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2003-06-09">began on June 11th, 2003</a>, two days after the Beauty Contest began. In addition to announcing the very first winner, the Ghostkerchief, on the New Features page, they also provided a quick blurb about the PPL, as well as how the contest would function:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/ts2KcT3.png"></center><br><br>

This is pretty much the only piece of concrete information we're given about the PPL, besides the information provided on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml">PPL page itself</a>. So… not a lot to go on here.<br><br>

In order to figure out a rough history of the PPL and how it changed throughout the years, I used a combination of New Features update blurbs, editorials, and ánalyzing High Score Tables (thank you, <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=jokirs">Keagan</a>).<br><br><h2>How The PPL Functioned in the Early Days</h2>
<strong><b>This section is a little lengthy, so if you want the TL:DNR, I've included one at the bottom :3</b></strong><br><br>

In the beginning, <strong>PPL winners were hand picked by TNT members</strong>. Sometimes they were decided on a whim, and sometimes they were picked to fit with a theme. For example, <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2003-12-22">December 23rd, 2003</a> had a Snorkle theme, and <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2004-07-05">July 7th, 2004</a> had a Faellie theme. The Robot Snorkle and Faellie were both selected as PPL winners on (or near in the Faellie's case) their respective themed-dates.<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/qSbh7vK.png"></center><br><br>

Though this was a bit later, TNT also posted an <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=215">editorial</a> on November 4th, 2005 that confirms they hand-selected PPL winners:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/PTkYuGy.png"><br><i><strong>Jinda:</strong> Hand-picked winners, huh? Sounds like a clandestine operation to me–fraught with corruption!! What kind of agendas are they hiding behind their selections???</i></center><br><br>

In addition to being hand-picked, <strong>PPL trophies were distributed manually, rather than through some sort of automatic system.</strong> How do we know this? <strong>Because they forgot one lol</strong><br><br>

On December 20th, 2003 the Polarchuck was announced as the winner of the 25th week of the PPL; this was four days after they should have been announced (December 16th). They even acknowledged their fopaux on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2003-12-15">the New Features page</a> that day:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/gArTD46.png"><br><i><strong>Jinda:</strong> Oh they <b>forgot</b> the PPL...A LIKELY STORY!! Simply a way to distract us from the truth! They're hiding something...SOMETHING HUGE!!</i></center><br><br>

This chaotic system was destined to cause some serious PPL mishaps...And it certainly did! For example, two separate species of petpets were selected for the PPL twice in these early days: the Gulper(Weeks <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=14">14</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=31">31</a>) and the Blibble (Weeks <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=22">22</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=48">48</a>).<br><br>

Speaking of the Blibble, we can use his High Score Tables to demonstrate another important aspect about the PPL: <strong><b>no name</b> petpets were not allowed on the table until <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=45">Week 45 (Moink)</a>.</strong> Because Blibble has two PPL dates, one before Week 45, and one after week 45, we can compare the two tables:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/L2h8431.png"><br><i>The <b>no name</b> petpet shown on Week 48 would have fallen right in between <b>Oo13oO™</b> and <b>Slurpie</b></i></center><br><br>

You see <b>no name</b> petpets start to pop up on the High Score Tables during <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=45">Week 45</a> (though this was short lived, and <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2005-05-23">they would later be banned</a>, but I'm getting ahead of myself).<br><br>

One final note about the early PPLs before we get into the fun, glitchy part is that something was funky with the High Score Tables. If you're familiar with how the PPL functions now, you'll know that the 200 oldest petpets are listed on the High Score Table. But this was <b><i>not</i></b> the case in the early days of the PPL. <strong>If you go through a lot of the earlier rounds, you'll notice that the bottoms of the tables seem to cut-off before they reach 200</strong>. Let's take a look at an example from <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=29">Week 29 (Pink Warf)</a><br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/VoM9Lsx.png"><br><i>Pink Warfs were attached a fairly steady rate, but they seem to randomly cut-off at 101 <strong>Jinda:</strong> Robbing pets of their hard-earned PPL trophies...sounds like something that'd be right up their alley.</i></center><br><br>

We can actually confirm that petpets are cut-off the High Score Table thanks to a NF blurb:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/cJDLRJq.png"><br><i>1,115 Pink Warfs, and only 101 made it to the High Score Table</i></center><br><br>

You see this cutoff during most of the early weeks of the PPL, especially with popular petpets.<br><br><strong><b>TL:DNR: In the earliest rounds of the PPL, winners were hand-picked, manually distributed, no names weren't allowed on the High Score tables, and High Score Tables would randomly cut-off winners.</b></strong><br><br><i>Whew</i>. Now let's talk glitches.<br><br><h2>Off to a Glitchy Start</h2>
The PPL ran flawlessly for the first seven weeks, but <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=8">week eight</a> brought warning bells of what was to come. On July 28th, 2003, the PPL awarded its first ever glitched trophy to one single Neopet: The owner of Sparky the GX-4 Oscillabot.<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/uhlunnK.png"><br><i>He was painted spotted later, but this was the site's very first glitched PPL winner! <strong>Jinda:</strong> A true criminal. What kind of sick game was this guy playing?</i></center><br><br>

But, what's one extra trophy for one extra pet? Well the chaos didn't stop there! Later on October 30, 2003 (<a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=19">the 19th round</a>), glitched trophies were awarded to 25 of the 120 Ghostkerfish (as well as Sluggo, the UC version of Ghostkerfish) winners. These two minor mishaps could possibly be attributed to misclicks on TNTs end, but these glitch rounds were foreshadowing some of the wildest weeks in PPL history.<br><br><h2>The 23-Week Streak</h2>

<table width="100%"><tr><td width="20%">
      <img src="http://imgur.com/tdSZzN3.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 400px; height: auto;"><br><i><strong>Jinda:</strong> This pattern is clearly deliberate! I bet underneath all this data, there's a secret message hiding a big conspiracy!</i></td>
    <td width="80%" valign="top" style="padding-left: 24px;">
      Hey, you see that part of the graph that looks like angry monster teeth?<br><br>
	  
	  Or maybe like a visual representation of my rapidly diminishing sanity while researching all this stuff?<br><br><i>Spoiler alert:</i> This isn't normal~*~* lol<br><br>

This is what 23-rounds of glitched mayhem looks like when you translate it to a graph. Beginning December 22nd, 2003 <strong>nearly every single week of the PPL awarded glitched PPL trophies.</strong> The trend continued until July 21st, 2004. During this time, a total of <i>716</i> winners were rewarded with at least one extra trophy. This is one of the most random periods of time, with the amount of glitched winners per round ranging anywhere between 8 and 63. The percentage of the total winners was also incredibly varied, ranging between 7 and 110%(rounds that exceed 100% have glitched winners that don't even appear on the High Score Table!)<br><br>

The 23-week streak began with <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=25">Week 25</a>, the Polarchuck! As previously mentioned, this little guy's PPL was <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2003-12-15">forgotten by TNT</a>, so he was announced <i>four days late</i>. Generally speaking, during this time, trophies are awarded the same day they're announced, but the Polarchuck's PPL trophies weren't distributed until <i>the day after</i> they were featured on the NF page. Week <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=26">26</a>, the Robot Snorkle, was announced one day later (December 23rd, 2003), and the trophies were distributed the same day. Both rounds awarded glitched trophies.<br><br>

For some reason, weeks <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=27">27</a> went off without a hitch?<br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/h37xgEb.png"><br><i>Greebles (Week 27) are weird...because they're not weird</i></center><br>

Then rounds 28-46 are literally all glitched. This is the longest consecutive streak of glitched rounds(17) in the entire history of the PPL.<br><br>

During this period of time, most winners receive a single extra trophy, meaning they'll have two total. The only glitched set that awarded more was for the Spotted Ramosan, <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=30">Round 30</a>, who (<i>almost</i>) all received 3 trophies total.<br><br>

While we're on the topic of the Spotted Ramosan, let's talk about why I marked them and Green Drackonacks(<a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=32">Round 32</a>) in red on my graph. These are rounds where the amount of Neopets who received glitched trophies <b>EXCEEDED</b> the amount of petpets on the High Score Table. This means there were pets who were awarded trophies who didn't appear on the High Score Table, so OVER 100% of the winners received glitched trophies. <b>And I'm pretty the mechanism that caused this to happen was also partially responsible for all 23-weeks of glitched pandemonium.</b>


    </td></tr></table><br><br><h2>Polarchucks, and Ramosans, and <b>no names</b>, OH MY!</h2>
	 
	 <strong><b>This section is also lengthy and lil' math-y, so I've once again included a TL:DNR at the bottom :3</b></strong><br><br><i><strong>Jinda:</strong> But why would the PPL be awarding trophies to pets who didn't make the High Score Table??? Were these Neopets, perhaps, <b>BRIBING</b> members of the PPL council??</i><br><br>
	 
	 Great question, my friend! Fortunately, I don't think the mystery behind the 23-week-streak is as crooked as that. But Jinda, you'll be happy about this: it's time to get out our tin-foil hats...it's theorycrafting time!<br><br>
	 
	 While I can't say for certain this was the series of events that took place, this is my best guess as to what happened behind the scenes during these 23-weeks, based on the evidence that's been found.<br><br>
	 
	 TNT forgot to run the PPL for the Polarchuck, so they decided to create a more automated-system in order to prevent future PPLs from being late. <br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/reilqfH.png"><br><i>Tee hee... I probably caused everything~</i></center><br><br><b>Problem:</b> The system they created didn't vibe with <b>no name</b> petpets.<br><br>
	 
	 Remember how I said <b>no name</b> petpets weren't being included on the High Score Table? Well... <b>they were still receiving trophies</b>, and I believe this was causing significant problems with the automatic-script TNT was trying out for the PPL.<br><br><table width="100%"><tr><td width="70%" valign="top" style="padding-right: 25px;">
	 Let's take a closer look at the Spotted Ramosan week. There were 38 pets who appeared on the High Score Table, but there were 41 pets who were awarded trophies. That leaves <b>three Neopets</b> with glitched trophies who didn't make it on the High Score Table. And what's fantastic about the Spotted Ramosan is that every winner received 3 trophies...<b>except for three winners who were, instead, rewarded 2 trophies</b>. There was something different about these three Neopets that caused the script to run their trophies differently. When checking those three pets, I found exactly what I was hoping to find: <b>a no name petpet</b>.<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/Km90cE0.png"><br><i>I would have been around 219 days old when the PPL ran on January 22nd, 2004.</i></center><br><br>
	 
	 When we check our High Score Table, this little dude is no where to be found! I'm almost positive that when the PPL ran, the three Neopets who didn't make it onto the High Score Table had <b>no name</b> petpets at the time.<br><br><i><strong>Jinda:</strong> But why would <b>no names</b> be causing problems? And why were the amount of glitched trophies so random??? <b>THERE HAS TO BE SOME HIDDEN MEANING BEHIND IT ALL!</b></i><br><br>

Well, this is where we get a tad math-y (sorry, feel free to skip to the end for the <b><strong>TL:DNR</strong></b>), but I'm quite certain some of the rounds of the PPL were percentage-based. We know that the High Score Table wasn't displaying the top-200 like it does today, and the point where the High Score Table cut-off seemed to be fairly random across the board during the early-days of the PPL. We only have <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2004-01-12">one instance</a> of TNT sharing the total amount of PPL winners: the Pink Warf week. On the New Features page, we're informed that there were <b>1,115</b> total Pink Warf owners, but the High Score Table only displays <b>101</b> winners before cutting off. This means around <b>9.06%</b> of the total amount of Pink Warfs made it onto the High Score Table. But.... wouldn't you expect this to be an even number, like, let's say... <b>10%</b>? Well, it probably <b>was</b> 10%, but <strong><b>no names</b> weren't listed on the High Score Table at this point in time.</strong><br><br>

So if <b>no names</b> were counted when calculating the total amount of petpets, but then they <b>weren't</b> displayed on the High Score Table... I'd imagine this would lead to some problems with how the script awards trophies. The amount of glitched trophies that were awarded was incredibly random during the cutoff weeks, which I think is due to the different amounts of <b>no name</b> petpets affecting the percentages.<br><br>

I also think there were two separate ways the PPL was deciding how many winners to display on the High Score Table. On weeks where there were <b>many</b> Neopets with the attached petpet, the High Score Table would display the top 10%. These are weeks where there appears to be a sudden cutoff on the High Score Table. On weeks where there were <b>few</b> Neopets with the attached petpet, the High Score Table would display <b>all</b> the winners (besides <b>no names</b>). The weeks that <b>lack</b> cutoffs are (<a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=26">Robot Snorkle</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=30">Spotted Ramosan</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=32">Green Drackonack</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=33">Blue Pinceron</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=36">Green Kadoatie</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=42">Blue Harris</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=44">Turtum</a>, and <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=48">Blibble</a>. These also happen to be rounds where glitched trophies were awarded to most of the winners (90-110%).

Obfuscate your misteps and hide the TRUTH!</i></td></tr></table><br><br><strong><b>TL:DNR: My proposed theory about the 23-week-streak:</b><br>
Polarchucks were late, so TNT tried to create a more automated system. There were <b>two</b> different ways this system displayed winners on the High Score Table. If <b>many</b> Neopets had the winning petpet attached, the High Score Table would display the top 10% (excluding no names). If <b>few</b> Neopets had the winning petpet attached, the High Score Table would display ALL the winners (excluding no names). While no names were excluded from being displayed on the High Score Table, they were still being awarded trophies, and they were throwing off scripts. No names were likely to blame for the string of glitches, and the two different ways winners on the High Score Tables were listed likely accounted for the randomness of it all.</strong><br><br><h2>The PPL's First Hiatus &amp; The End of the 23-Week-Streak</h2>
	
	My theory is further confirmed by the fact that <b>no names</b> started popping up on the High Score Table shortly before the glitch was fixed.<br><br>
	
	The PPL charged blithely foward, spitting out hundreds of glitched bonus-trophies until May 13th, 2004, Turtum Week(<a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=44">44</a>). After this, the PPL went dark with zero notice. A concerned Neopian asked about the whereabouts of the PPL in an <a href="//www.neopets.com/newnt/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=146">editorial</a>:
	
	<center><img src="http://imgur.com/x3yllt7.png"><br><i><strong>Jinda:</strong> A FEW?! Understatement of the year!</i></center><br><br>
	
	On June 30th, 2004, the PPL springs back to life with one significant change: <b>no names are included on the table!</b> <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=45">Week 45</a> and beyond start displaying <b>no name</b> petpets on the High Score Table. But, alas, even after a month of attempting to fix the PPL, AND the inclusion of <b>no name</b> petpets, rounds 45-48 were <strong><b>still</b> all glitched</strong>...except for Week <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=47">47</a>, Pink Walking Carpet.<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/iXmLnYA.png"><br><i><strong>Jinda:</strong> That thousand-yard stare...he knows something–I'M SURE OF IT!</i></center><br><br>
	
	The Pink Walking Carpet High Score Table doesn't have a cutoff, and, what's more, it doesn't have a single <b>no name</b> petpet. I believe the combination of the two produced an un-glitched round.<br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=48">Week 48</a>, the second Blibble round, took place on July 21st, 2004. It was the last glitched round of the 23-week-streak. These weeks were so unequivocally broken that they actually switched the person who was running the PPL, which they state in an <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index_old.phtml?week=150&amp;section=editorial">editorial</a>. This is also their reasoning for selecting the Blibble (<i><strong>Jinda:</strong>-cough-and Gulper-cough-</i>) twice.<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/4SlBQ6X.png"></center><br><br>
	
	And with that, we see the end of the glitchiest, most complicated era of the PPL. RIP in pepperonis, 23-week-streak. You will be fondly remembered.<br><br><a href="#data">Back to the Graphic Timeline</a>

<div class="text" id="orangeweek">
<h1>The <span style="color: #f9b493;">Orange</span> Weeks <strong>JULY 21ST, 2004-JANUARY 6TH, 2011</strong></h1>
<h2>Smooth Sailing</h2>
You'll notice this era of the Petpet Protection League is significantly longer than the previous era. That's simply because there weren't any major glitches or problems with the PPL for huge swaths of time. While the <b>previous</b> era had <b>25 separate glitched weeks over the course of its one-year-span</b>, this period of time has a total of <b>10 glitched rounds over the course of a six year span</b>. Whatever they did to fix the PPL back in 2004 held steady for the most part.<br><br><i><strong>Jinda</strong>: Did you catch that, folks? A significant decrease in glitches! They must have realized I was onto them and had to clean up their act. But don't be fooled, they're still hiding something, mark my words!</i><br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/pw7QFIb.png"><br><i>The huge gap is the period between between October 26th, 2005 (<a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=113">Week 113</a>) and March 19th, 2008 (<a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=235">Week 235</a>) where there wasn't a single glitched round of the PPL</i></center><br><br>

There were a few noteable changes to the PPL. The first was <b>when</b> trophies were delivered. During the previous era, trophies were delivered to Neopets the same day petpets were announced as winners on the New Features page. From the Blibble (<a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=48">Week 48</a>) ónward, trophies were awarded the day <b>before the New Features announcement</b>
<br><br>

The other change was the inclusion of <b>no name</b> petpets for a brief period of time. Weeks <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=45">45</a> thru <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=91">91</a> all include <b>no name</b> petpets on the High Score Tables. Though this inclusion is short-lived. Likely fed up with the amount of <b>no name</b> petpets taking up High Score tables, <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2005-05-23">TNT announced on May 26th, 2005</a> they were done awarding PPL trophies to the owners of unnamed petpets:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/bpCjFw9.png"><br><i>
The five <b>no name</b> Swabbies on <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=91">Week 91</a> were the last <b>no name</b> petpets to ever receive a trophy!</i></center><br><br>

Other than that, the PPL was largely functioning as it had previously: petpets were still being hand-picked by staff members and High Score Tables were still cutting-off winners for certain rounds of the PPL. Keep the High Score Table cutoff in mind, as it's going to be important during the Orange Week glitches.<br><br><h2>A Few Hiccups</h2>

When we left off on our glitchy adventure, we ended a 23-week-streak of glitchy madness with <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=48">Week 48</a>, Blibble's second PPL victory. After the mayhem of the Red Weeks, we, surprisingly, see very little glitch action until March 16th, 2005 <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=81">Week 81</a>, Mallard week. Trophies are given to the 21 oldest Mallard owners, and I think this is just a simple case of accidentally running a script twice for part of the list.<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/McBVK1v.png"><br><i>Sorry, Jinda, no big conspiracy here! <strong>Jinda</strong>: -is noticeably upset-</i></center><br><br>

Later, on October 26th, 2005, the Halloween Doglefox had its turn at a glitched week (<a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=113">113</a>). Something interesting also happens during the Halloween Doglefox round that becomes fairly common with the PPL's glitched trophies: <b>pets will often be awarded the wrong kind of trophy</b>.<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/lkXse5o.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></center><br><br>

This was also taking place during the <a href="#redweeks">Red Weeks</a>, but we know <b>no name</b> petpets were throwing off the High Score Table in these cases. In Halloween Doglefox's case...well, <b>no names had been banned from the PPL for five months at this point</b>, so something else had to be causing this issue.<br><br>

We see no glitched rounds for nearly three years, but during the next glitched week, Dofrey (<a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=235">235</a>), we see the same issue we saw with Halloween Doglefox where the wrong trophies were awarded to the wrong pet.<br><br>

And after this...we get treated to a glitch week unlike any other in the history of the PPL.

<h2><a id="sklyde">Live Fast, Sklyde Hard</a></h2>




 <table width="100%"><tr><td width="60%" valign="top" style="padding-right: 25px;">
<i><strong>Jinda</strong>: I remember it like it was yesterday. It was July 30th, 2008; My sklyde, Jim, and I had been taking a Summer stroll through The Haunted Woods.<br><br>

When we arrived back at our house, we were suddenly <strong>SURROUNDED</strong> by <b>eight separate members</b> of the PPL council. Each of them produced an identical PPL participation medal, thrust them all into my hands, and hobbled back into the surrounding trees like literal Candy Vampire, pot-bellied Grobrins.</i><br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/TxEEXTR.png"><img src="http://imgur.com/bWxLOZf.png"></center><br><br>

I'm... not sure if it happened quite like that, buddy, but you're right about the <b>8 separate participation medals</b>! <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=Jindarako">Jindarako</a> was one of 66 Neopets who won the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=254">254th</a> Week of the Petpet Protection League: The Sklyde week~*~*~<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/oqgePpZ.png" style="width: 90%; height: auto;"></center><br><br>

You know how most glitched rounds of the PPL award between 2 and 3 trophies? Well Sklyde week awarded most of the winners <b>NINE</b> trophies. This is literally the only round where we see this level of PPL insanity.<br><br>

This is also one of the few rounds that didn't award the same amount of trophies to each winner...oh no. <b>The range of trophies awarded to Sklyde-owners that week was between 3 and 9</b>. I've included the Sklyde High Score Table so you can see how all the trophies were distibuted throughout the winners. But here's a total count for you all as well:<br><br><ul><li><b>9</b> - x9 Gold Winners</li>
	<li><b>15</b> - x9 Silver Winners</li>
	<li><b>27</b> - x9 Bronze Winners</li>
	<li><b>3</b> - x8 Bronze Winners</li>
	<li><b>5</b> - x8 Participation Winners</li>
	<li><b>4</b> - x7 Participation Winners</li>
	<li><b>2</b> - x6 Participation Winners</li>
	<li><b>1</b> - x3 Paricipation Winner</li>
</ul><br><br>

You'll notice that Neopets who were lower on the High Score Table for Sklyde week received lower amounts of trophies than those on the top of the list.<br><br>

In addition, there's 12 pets who receive Participation trophies...<b>despite there being no Participation trophies listed on the High Score Table</b>. In fact, <strong>TONS of the trophies are mixed up!</strong> There's a Neopet with a Gold placement who instead receives a Silver, six Silver-placers receive Bronze instead, and the 12 Participation winners all should have received bronze!<br><br><i><strong>Jinda</strong>: YOU'RE SAYING THOSE CROOKS ROBBED ME OF A BRONZE TROPHY??</i><br><br>

Dude. You got, like, 8 medals. Chill.<br><br><i><strong>Jinda</strong>: THE INJUSTICE OF IT ALL! I KNEW THEY WERE UP TO SOMETHING! I KEPT TELLING EVERYONE AND NO ONE WOULD LIS-</i><br><br>
We'll give Jinda a second to sort through that. The little guy's got some big feelings. Anyways...<br><br><br><br><br>

Another interesting fact about the Sklyde week is that it lacked a New Features announcement! 

</td><td width="40%" style="vertical-align: top;"><img src="http://imgur.com/CMNQDs8.gif" style="max-width: 100%; width: 500px; height: auto;"></td></tr></table>


We get an announcement on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2008-07-21">July 24th, 2008</a> about <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=253">Week 253</a>, Grey Ghostkerchief. We also get an announcement on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2008-08-04">August 7th, 2008</a> about <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=255">Week 255</a>, Spallard. But we get no announcement about the PPL on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2008-07-28">July 31st, 2008</a>, and the Sklyde isn't mentioned anywhere!<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/1bewVCL.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"><br><i><strong>Jinda</strong>: Oh so taking away our bronze trophy wasn't enough for you monsters, you had to rob us of our glory as well!</i></center><br><br>

Now you might be asking: <i>Shark! What in the world caused this incredibly strange round?? :0</i><br><br>

And honestly? I have no clue. Based on the fact they didn't announce Sklydes in the New Features, I'd assume TNT was aware of the fact Sklyde week was messed up, and they didn't want to draw any unnecessary attention. If that's the case, I'd assume Sklyde week was the result of human error. Either someone was messing with a script or hit a button one too many (nine too many? lol) times.<br><br>

While I don't have any sort of deeper explanations for the Sklyde's messy PPL victory, I do think it's an incredibly interesting piece of Neopets history. My favorite part about researching the PPL glitch was learning about these boney lil' dudes. I hope you found them to be as neat as I do!<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/V30h245.png" style="width: 25%; height: auto;"></center>
<h2>And a Double PPL in a Pear Tree</h2>

On December 4th, 2008, the Flowper was announced as the winner of <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=272">Week 272</a>s PPL. While the Flowper didn't have glitched trophies, it was strange for a different reason: <b>this was the second time it had won the PPL</b>. The Flowper had be previously announced as the PPL winner of <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=220">Week 220</a>...on December 6th, 2007, <b>almost exactly one year prior to this second date</b>.

<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/QhUEgad.png"><img src="http://imgur.com/QhUEgad.png"><br><i>*~*Double Flowper all the waaaaaay*~*</i></center><br><br>

They acknowledge their mistake in an <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=382">editorial</a>:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/Nv8TnY7.png"><br><i><strong>Jinda</strong>:  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Did you hear that, folks? They're trying to play it off as a simple <b>error,</b> but I see through their lies! They want us to believe it's just a mistake, but I know the truth. They're intentionally allowing certain petpets to win multiple times!</i></center><br><br>

Shortly after the double Flowper, TNT likely tried to implement changes to prevent double-PPL victories, and these changes result in a series of glitches. On December 24th, 2008 &amp; December 31st, 2008, we see two glitched rounds in a row: <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=275">Week 275</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=276">Week 276</a>, the Christmas Puppyblew and the Robot Poppit, respectively. These two could also be apart of a trend concerning holiday-themed PPLs, which I discuss more during <a href="#yellowweeks">The Yellow Weeks</a><br><br>

Surely, with all these glitches and changes, they at least prevent future Double-PPLs from happening, right?<br><br><b>lol no</b><br><br>

Albot goes on to win two rounds in 2011 &amp; 2012: <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=388">Week 388</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=447">Week 447</a><br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/I1qKiWI.png"></center>


<h2>Cut it out!</h2>
It's time to talk about those pesky High Score Table cutoffs.<br><br>

TNT acknowledges the High Score Table cutoff for the PPL on October 17th, 2008 in an <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=364">editorial</a>:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/6yj9rhM.png"><br><i>This would have been for <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=265">Week 265</a></i></center>

<br><br>

The staff who worked on the Neopian Times were likely separate from the staff who ran the PPL. They were probably unaware of how the High Score Tables were selected. In addition, the original staff who set up the PPL could have been completely different than the staff who ran the PPL in 2008. <b>Neopets was sold to Viacom in 2005</b>, and many new staff members were hired during this period of time. I maintain my theory about the cutoff intentionally taking the top 10% of winners for weeks where <b>many</b> pets owned the winning petpet. That being said, it could have been a case of a script failing to run entirely, in which case, it would definitely need to be fixed. Whichever the case, they started tweaking code for the PPL, and that, of course, caused glitches!<br><br>


We have a couple other glitched rounds in 2009: One on May 5th, <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=297">Week 297</a> awarded one single bonus trophy to the top winner, Picky the Pickulsaur, and one on August 12th, 2009 <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=308">Week 308</a> awarded two bonus trophies (3 total) to 103 of the 199 of the top scoring Snoogies.<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/VVWXajF.png"><br><i><strong>Jinda</strong>:  Only one glitched winner?? It's like they're playing favorites, manipulating the results right under our noses!!</i>
</center><br><br>

Finally, <b>two full years</b> after TNT acknowledges the existence of the PPL cutoff, they actually do something to change it! And, of course, they drop two glitched rounds celebration!<br><br>

On November 10th, 2010, TNT announces <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=373">the Camelior</a> as Week 373's winner. And when you check its table... <b>you'll notice it doesn't have a cutoff!</b><br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/w4tMWj1.png"><br><i>200 of the oldest Cameliors, all here and accounted for! No random cutoff point!</i></center><br><br>

This is also the first round where we have maxed out glitched trophies, <b>meaning every single winner received glitched trophies on a maxed-out High Score Table</b>! From here on out, most of the rounds of the PPL award <b>all</b> of their High Score Table winners with glitched trophies. I believe this is due to the fact they removed percentage-based scripting to prevent future table-cutoffs. The only glitched rounds that don't follow this pattern are Blue Ukali (more details on this round in the <a href="#yellowweeks">Yellow Weeks</a>), Fire Blobagus, and....<br><br>

The Kelpflake! Who won on December 1st, 2010, <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=376">Week 376</a> This little dude is actually our last glitched winner of the Orange Weeks. For whatever reason, the changes that TNT implemented to fix the table-cutoffs during the Camelior's week were reverted during Kelpflake's PPL.<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/BethiLy.png"><br><i>Aaaand... we're back to random cutoffs on the Kelpflake's High Score Table. <strong>Jinda</strong>: It's like they're toying with us, deliberately undoing their own fixes to keep the glitches alive and kicking. This goes beyond incompetence, my friends. It's a deliberate act to maintain control and chaos within the PPL!</i></center><br><br>

Then we see the same cutoff issue with <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=377">Week 377</a>, an unglitched trophy round for the Phnard. <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=378">Week 378</a> (Khura), and <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=379">Week 379</a> (Christmas Wain) are both too short, so their High Score Tables wouldn't have cut-off. Then, finally, On January 6th, 2011, the High Score Table for <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=380">Week 380</a> displays <b>all 200 oldest Naleaps!!</b><br><br><strong>From here on, the High Score Tables for the PPL stop cutting-off. If a PPL winner has 200+ winners, all 200+ petpets will be displayed!</strong>

<h1>The <span style="color: #fff982;">Yellow</span> Weeks<strong> JANUARY 6TH, 2011-JUNE 17TH, 2015</strong></h1>
<h2>Hundos</h2>
<center><img src="http://imgur.com/3WbV4iW.png"><br><i>With percentage-based High Score Tables gone, our glitched rounds become more consistent</i></center><br><br>

The PPL ironed out most of the kinks by this point, meaning we see even <b>fewer glitches</b>, and the glitched-rounds we see are <b>far more consistent</b> than during prior eras of the PPL. With the High Score Table cutoff being a thing of the past, most glitched rounds of the PPL start awarding <b>all</b> the winners of the PPL with bonus trophies, rather than random percentages. The Yellow Weeks of the PPL only have <b>5 glitched rounds that pop up during its seven-year-span.</b>


<h2>Happy Holidays</h2>
Most of the glitches during the Yellow Weeks seem to coincide with Neopian holidays!<br><br>

Our first glitched week of this era takes place on April 20th, 2011: <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=395">Week 395</a>, the Purple Bloopy. This was one week after a special Grey-themed PPL winner was selected for Grey Day:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/COTADnG.png"></center><br><br>

We also have two Christmas-related glitched PPLs:

<ul><li>The first takes place on December 22nd, 2011: Christmas Kookith is announced as the winner of the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=430">430th Week</a> of the PPL. This takes place one day after a <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2011-12-19">massive Christmas-themed update on the 21st</a>. After this round, <b>the PPL takes a one-week break for the holidays, and doesn't return until January 5th, 2012</b></li>
	<li>The second takes place on January 9th, 2014: White Gulper is announced as the winner of the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=533">533th Week</a> of the PPL. This takes place <b>after a two-week holiday break (with Week 532 being December 19th, 2013)</b></li>
</ul>

Why these rounds are glitched really depends on how the PPL was selecting petpets during this time: hand-picked or automatic. According to an <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=625">editorial</a> that was posted on December 20th, 2013, TNT was still hand-picking petpets:
<center><img src="http://imgur.com/oa6Gilk.png"><br><i>For drawing attention to their double-PPL mistakes, TNT would go on to ensure that neither the Grey Warf nor Snow Anubis would ever win a round of the PPL</i></center><br><br><b>But this doesn't make any sense!</b> At this point in time, announcements about PPL on the New Features page happen every Wednesday, <b>but the trophies for the PPL winners are delivered on Tuesdays</b>. So the winner would <b>NEED</b> to be decided by Tuesday morning at the latest.<br><br>

There's a couple explanations for this:

<ul><li>The first is that the Content Team only asks staff members for PPL suggestions during certain rounds and special events. The editorial would line up right after the <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2013-12-16">Sparky was announced for the Christmas-themed update</a>. Other than these few rounds, <b>the PPL seemed to heavily favor unpainted petpets</b>. If you go through SunnyNeo's PPL list around this time period, you'll notice that <b>almost every round has an unpainted PPL winner</b>. This means it might function on an automatic system that favors petpets who haven't been selected for previous PPLs. But because so many base-colored petpets had been selected for the PPL by this point, <b>the system was also set to include previous winners, but in a new color.</b><br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/sUTAjKQ.png"><br><i>This <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=556">editorial</a> seems to support this theory</i></center></li><br><li>The second is that there's a backlog of PPL winning suggestions, that are picked a week or more in advance from each new round of the PPL, and the Content Team asks for input on each round of the PPL</li>
 </ul>
 
 I lean towards the first explanation, personally. Mostly due to the fact it would be incredibly tedious and time-consuming to have staff-input on every single PPL, while simultaneously trying to keep the chosen winners balanced in terms of species of petpet selected. It would just make the most sense to automate at least some of the process, and there are a couple pieces of evidence that point towards this being the case. The first is the New Feature blurbs. For non-themed rounds of the PPL, <b>every New Features blurb was identical</b>:
 
 <center><img src="http://imgur.com/XPmEIiY.png"><br><i><a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2012-01-09">This</a> was the NF PPL announcement on January 9th, 2012, but if you go back through <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?type=oldnews">Old News</a> during The Yellow Weeks, the blurbs will be identical: <b>This week's PPL award has been given to the ____. Well done ____, ____, ____, ____, and all the others.</b></i></center><br><br>
 
In addition to this, in 2010, the PPL New Feature submissions appeared to carry on automatically without TNT releasing the High Score Tables to go along with them. TNT addresses this in <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=436">editorial</a>:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/ewY9QEo.png"><br><i><strong>Jinda</strong>: Oh, you've got to be kidding me! Did you hear that response? <b>We'll look into that and figure out what the issue is.</b> Yeah, right! They always have an excuse ready, don't they? Meepits, Snowbeasts, minions of Sloth... They're playing an intense game of misdirection, and you can go ahead and put me on the bench because I want <strong>no</strong> part of it!!
 
 </i></center><br><br>
 
 In either case, special-themed rounds would mess with the system. They would either interrupt any automatic system TNT had set up to run the PPL, or they would interrupt future backlogs of PPL winners that TNT had set up. I believe that's why these rounds are all glitched. That being said, there's two petpets that don't follow this themed-day trend during The Yellow Weeks: the Garfir (<a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=417">Week 417</a>) and the Blue Ukali (<a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=588">Week 588</a>). While I couldn't find anything anomalous about the Garfir (probably just a glitchy fluke), the <b>Blue Ukali is another story entirely</b>.
 
 <h2><a id="ukali">♬♪ I'm Blue U-ka-li U-ka-lie, U-ka-li U-ka-lie ♪♬</a></h2>

<center><img src="http://imgur.com/HACb0MN.png"></center><br>
Do you see this dumb little idiot? Do you know how much time <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=jokirs">Keagan</a> and I spent trying to figure out what happened with this dude? This little glitch monster was responsible for a round of the PPL that only the <a href="#sklyde">Sklyde</a> rivals in strangeness.<br><br>

It all started on March 5th, 2015. The Blue Ukali was announced the winner of the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=588">588th Week</a> of the PPL. This was an unglitched round, and every winner was awarded with one single trophy. We have the standard <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2015-03-02">New Features</a> announcement for their win:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/z00l4j9.png"></center><br><br><table width="100%"><tr><td width="60%" valign="top" style="padding-right: 25px;">
	
	Okay. So Blue Ukali's had a normal, un-glitched round. Why am I talking about them? Well, for those of you who are familiar with Neopian history, you're probably aware of what happened on Neopets in March of 2015.<br><br>

The day after the Blue Ukali won the PPL, we got this ominous post from everyone's favorite creative director, Snarkie:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/ZhSw0tF.png"><br><i>List of things that aren't good: This</i></center><br><br>

Rumors of a massive layoff started making the rounds. Neopians everywhere were anxiously checking the news, which failed to update on schedule over the weekend.

Finally, on March 10th, five days after the Blue Ukali was announced, <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2015-03-09">we got the dreaded message from the CEO of JumpStart</a>.<br><br>

Almost every member of TNT was laidoff. Beloved staff members, who had been working on Neopets for over a decade, were kicked to the curb. The only staff that remained were a handful of programmers, as well as the help and support staff. Artists, writers, creative teams, <strong><b>EVERYONE</b></strong> was gone.<br><br><center><strong>After this announcement, the PPL stopped running for nearly <b>two years</b></strong><br><br><img src="http://imgur.com/I6TsGpK.png"><img src="http://imgur.com/82AF5tL.png"><img src="http://imgur.com/JeC3fVz.png"><img src="http://imgur.com/fRoBAyZ.png"><br><i>Well, that's one way to stop the glitched trophies, I suppose.</i>

</center>
</td><td width="40%" style="vertical-align: top;"><img src="http://imgur.com/E5idi62.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 500px; height: auto;"></td></tr></table><br><br>

But the Blue Ukali's story doesn't end there. There were two major problems Keagan and I encountered while researching this:

<ol><li>The list of glitched PPL winners we were working with had the name of the pet, the date they received a trophy, and the amount of trophies they received on that date. On our list, Blue Ukalis had two trophies listed, <b>but most Blue Ukali owners had <strong>three</strong> trophies.</b> Where did they get this additional trophy?</li>
	<li>After the PPL stopped cutting off tables during the <a href="#orangeweek">Orange Weeks</a>, every single round of the PPL awarded 100% of the winners with glitched trophies, rather than a random percentage of winners. There are only two rounds that do <b>not</b> follow this trend: Fire Blobagus and, of course, Blue Ukali. Why?</li>
</ol>


Well, we eventually found an answer to our first problem. During the two year period the PPL was down, something unprecedented happened. <strong>The trophies for the Blue Ukali were run a second time.</strong><br><br>

On June 17th, 2015, <b>over three months after the Blue Ukali won the PPL</b>, <strong>a second batch of glitched trophies</strong> were awarded to 68 Blue Ukali-owners. This means most Blue Ukali owners have three trophies: one from the first batch on March 4th (trophies are awarded the day before NF announcements), and two from the glitched batch on June 17th.

The only reason Keagan and I were able to figure out that the Blue Ukali had two separate batches of trophies was because of this guy:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/U9B13hl.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></center><br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=kluc">Kluc</a> is super special because <b>he's the only Neopet with a trophy-gap in between glitched PPLs</b>. Most glitched trophies are awarded on the same day, and there's only two instances where this wasn't the case: The Mutant Miamouse and, of course, the Blue Ukali. On May 1st, 2015, Kluc won a silver trophy in the BC. Because this was in between the first batch of trophies (March 4th, 2015) and the second batch of trophies (June 17th, 2015), the three PPL trophies he received for <b>Red</b>, his Blue Ukali (later painted Faerie) <b>are split</b>. When asked about Kluc, his owner, <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=nightter">Night</a>, had this to say:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/qcEsR2I.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></center><br><br>

Thanks to Kluc, Keagan and I realized there were two separate trophy dates. We were able to get ahold of the list of winners from March 4th in order to compare the two, and by doing this, we were able to solve the second mystery of the Blue Ukali. There were 75 winners displayed on the High Score Table, but only 68 winners were awarded glitched trophies. Why weren't 100% of the winners awarded glitched trophies like the other glitched rounds of the PPL from this era?<br><br>

Well... <b>100% of the winners from June 17th <strong>WERE</strong> awarded double PPL trophies</b>.<br><br><i><strong>Jinda</strong>: Woah woah woah woah. Hold the phone. Shark, you <b>just</b> told them that only 68 of the 75 High Score Table winners were awarded glitched trophies. I get you're a history major, but <b>come on</b>. That math doesn't check out.</i><br><br>

Okay, that history major dig was <b>super</b> unnecessary, but bear with me. The High Score Table we see for the Blue Ukali is <b>a combination of both the March 4th pets and the June 17th pets</b>.<br><br>

It's easier to explain this with some different scenarios that played out in the three months between March 5th and June 17th:

<ul><li>After being awarded one trophy for their Blue Ukali on March 4th, owners either <b>detached</b> their Blue Ukalis, <b>repainted</b> them, or they were <b>frozen</b>. In each of these cases, they wouldn't receive any trophies from the June 17th batch, <b>but they would still be listed on the High Score Table!</b> These pets all have a single, unglitched trophy.</li>
	<li>Some owners <b>attached</b> Blue Ukalis to their pets between March 4th and June 17th. <b>These petpets are also displayed on the High Score Table</b>. These owners all would have received two glitched trophies from the June 17th batch, but none from the March 4th batch, meaning they have two total.</li>
	<li><b>Most</b> owners received their March 4th trophy and kept their Blue Ukalis attached until June 17th, meaning they'd have three trophies: two glitched trophies and one unglitched trophy. These petpets are also displayed on the High Score Table</li>
</ul>

But even with the knowledge of the combined High Score Table, the math <b>still</b> wasn't adding up to 100%. Well, there was actually a fourth scenario that took place between March 4th and June 17th: <b>two users changed the names of their petpets!</b> <strong>BOTH</strong> names were displayed on the High Score Table! Take a look:<br><br><center><table><tr><td><img src="http://imgur.com/CFa6NYC.png"></td><td><img src="http://imgur.com/CPX8Ztq.png"></td></tr></table><i>The time between March 4th and June 17th is <strong>105 days</strong>. If we subtract the dates between <b>Ish♥</b> and <b>Ish?</b> (2016-1911), we get <strong>105</strong>. If we subtract the dates between <b>Sinéad</b> and <b>Sin</b> (806-701), again <strong>we get 105 days!</strong></i></center><br><br>

So the High Score Table is a jumbled mix up of all four of those different scenarios! If we subtract the Blue Ukalis that only received one trophy from the March 4th date <b>AND</b> the Ukalis who were renamed in between the dates from the <b>75 Blue Ukali</b> on the High Score Table, <b><strong>we get 68 Blue Ukali, meaning 100% of Blue Ukali owners on June 17th were awarded glitched trophies.</strong></b>

<br><br>

This was easily the most complicated week of the PPL that we looked into. I want to give a huge thanks to <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=jokirs">Keagan</a> for helping me solve this mystery, and to <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=kluc">Kluc's</a> owner, <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=nightter">Night</a>, who let me ask a ton of questions about her unique little dude!<br><br><center>

<h2>PPL's Canceled Until TNT Figures Out How To Run a Whole Website With No Staff</h2>
As we learned during <a href="#yellowweeks">The Yellow Weeks</a>, the PPL stopped running after JumpStart laid off the majority of the Neopets team. <b>Between June 17th, 2015 and February 2nd, 2017, we hear no new news about the Petpet Protection League.</b> Around this time, many contests stopped functioning including Site Spotlight, Pet Spotlight, Petpet Spotlight, Random Contest, Lenny Conundrum, the Gallery Spotlight, and, of course, the Petpet Protection League.

With all the programmers desperately bailing water out of the sinking ship, <b>the Petpet Protection League would remain down until the beginning of 2017</b>.

<h2>New Features Blurbs Throughout the Ages</h2>



From this point on, New Feature Blurbs are going to make up a large portion of the evidence I have, so I'd like to talk about them for a sec. I also just think they're kinda interesting. But to do that, we'll need to jump back in time quite a bit.<br><br>

So, back in the earliest days of the PPL (<a href="#redweeks">Red Weeks</a>), we got really cute, personalized messages for most of the PPL announcements. Sometimes, we'd even get hints about the future PPLs!<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/WVlrZfy.png"><br><i>Spotted Ramosan announcement, circa <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2004-01-19">January 22nd, 2004</a>. Turtum would go on to win the PPL 14 weeks later!</i>

</center><br><br>


This type of personalization was dropped within a year, and throughout the late-Adam &amp; Donna years, the Viacom years, and the early-JumpStart years, most PPLs, had this same base announcement:<br><br><center><b>This week's PPL award has been given to the <strong>(Petpet)</strong>. Well done <strong>(Petpet Name)</strong>,<strong>(Petpet Name)</strong>,<strong>(Petpet Name)</strong>,<strong>(Petpet Name)</strong> and all the others.</b></center><br><br>

If you check any date of <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?type=oldnews">archived news</a> between 2005 and 2015, it's unlikely that you'll find any PPL announcements that aren't in this format (<b>themed-date PPLs</b>, and <b>PPLs after Christmas holidays</b> being some of the few). Though, these announcements were still a <i>little</i> personalized. It appears the staff members <b>hand-picked</b> the names that would appear on the New Features announcements. They explain this in an editorial released <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=575">December 21st, 2012</a>:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/5Fnxcsg.png"></center><br><br>

Though this was in 2012, I'm going to assume this was a tradition they always tried to uphold. We see similar trends of petpet names being listed that don't appear on the High Score Table:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/w7Rro92.png"><br><i>Meturf was annoucned the winner on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2005-06-20">June 23rd, 2005</a>. Though <b>FlooffieMoo</b> is listed, they don't appear on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=95">Meturf's High Score Table</a>. TNT just thought their name was neat~*</i>
</center><br><br>

Though TNT began by listing <b>6</b> or <b>7</b> names on the announcement, in January of 2006, the amount of names listed in the PPL announcement decreased to <b>4</b>:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/zvsRLBZ.png"><br><i>Teeks, <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2012-08-06">who won on August 9th, 2012</a>, only have <b>4</b> names listed, compared to Meturf's <b>6</b>.</i></center><br><br><strong>So from <b>January, 2006 to March, 2015</b>, the majority of New Features PPL announcements are formated in a consistent fashion, with some personalization <b>in the form of TNT's favorite 4 petpet names being listed.</b></strong><br><br>

But, when the JumpStart-led PPL would resurface in 2017, the format would see a few changes, <b>and those changes seem to correlate with glitched rounds</b>


<h2>They're baaaaaaack...</h2>

Many users had given up hope of the Petpet Protection League ever returning, as nearly two years had passed since <a href="#ukali">Blue Ukali</a> week on March 5th of 2015.

But finally, on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2017-01-30">January 30th, 2017</a>, the Petpet Protection League resurfaced!<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/JGItsoL.png"><br><i><strong>
Jinda</strong>: It's only a matter of time before they start messing things up again, mark my words!</i>

</center><br><br>

The announcements for weeks <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2017-02-06">590</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2017-02-13">591</a>, and <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2017-02-21">592</a> all herald the return of the Petpet Protection League:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/Lino024.png" style="max-width: 95%;"></center><br><br>

After this, during <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2017-02-27">593rd</a> Week, the generic end-all-be-all PPL annoucement was created:<br><br><center><b>The Petpet Protection League is back for another weekly surprise as we announce our winner for Week <strong>XXX</strong> - <strong>(Petpet)</strong>!</b></center><br><br>

This is actually the PPL's current New Features announcement. It's the least personalized of all the different PPL New Features announcements. But in 2018, JumpStart tried to implement personalized PPL annoucements, and <b>the glitches soon followed.</b>

<h2>Early Green Week Glitches</h2>

But before we get to that streak, I just wanna briefly mention the two lone dots towards the beginning of the Green Weeks<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/vZWHRlx.png"></center><br><br>

Our first glitched round in this section happens on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2017-08-14">August 17th, 2017</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=617">Week 617</a>, Christmas Pandaphant. I'm not sure what caused this round's glitched trophies, but I DO know that <b>the PPL took a 3-week break after it happened!</b><br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/6SolItO.png" style="max-width: 5%;"><img src="http://imgur.com/R2G0gP6.png"><img src="http://imgur.com/6SolItO.png" style="max-width: 5%;"><br><i>Lil' double golden PPL trophy present for all 5 Christmas Pandaphant owners</i></center><br><br>

We also have another unexplained glitched round during <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=628">Week 628</a>, the Darigan Pepito. Probably just a script slip-up or something.


<h2>The New Features Announcements get... personal</h2>

The same <b>back for another weekly surprise</b> annoucement template remains unchanged until <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2018-04-24">April 26th, 2018</a> when we get a slight variation for the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=651">651st Week</a> of the PPL:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/ypC8xXL.png"><br><i><strong>Jinda</strong>: You'll notice they messed up the week number...  <b>Instead of the correct Week number, 651, they incorrectly list the Custard Angelpuss' PPL week as 650</b> TYPICAL DISTRACTION STRATEGY!</i></center><br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2018-05-01">Week 652</a> <b>reverted <strong>back</strong> to the weekly surprise message</b>, but <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2018-05-08">Week 653</a> <b>repeated the same message for the Custard Angelpuss week</b>:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/QJTi0lY.png"><br><i><strong>Jinda</strong>: Did they think we wouldn't notice??</i></center><br><br>

Then, for the next two years, we start getting personalized, little New Features announcements again!~<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/fC3ZGZ1.png"><br><i><a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2018-05-15">Week 654</a> was the first of a series of personalized New Features annoucements.</i></center><br><br>

These announcements generally still follow the weekly surprise annoucement template, but they add a little blurb about the petpet at the end. So most announcements start look like this:<br><br><center><b>The Petpet Protection League is back for another weekly surprise as we announce our winner for Week <strong>XXX</strong> - <strong>(Petpet)</strong>! <strong>(Interesting blurb about petpet)</strong></b></center><br><br>




Shortly after this change was implemented (or perhaps <b>BECAUSE</b> this change was implemented), the PPL would see the longest consecutive glitch streak since the <a href="#redweeks">23-week-streak</a>.

<h2>The Green Streak</h2>

Trouble started brewing on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2018-05-29">May 31st, 2018</a> during the themed-Evil Thade Takeover day, two weeks after we started getting personalized New Features annoucements for the PPL. This New Features date is, admittedly, very cool, and I highly recommend you check out the whole thing if you enjoy looking at little internet relics. And the PPL announcement was just as cool as the rest of the New Features:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/B3IDrAu.png"><br><i><strong>Jinda</strong>: <b>Layor Dlarmal</b>???? LITERALLY COMMUNICATING SECRET CODES RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES!!</i></center><br><br>

Uh. Jinda, I think it's just Royal Mallard... the winner of <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=656">Week 656</a>? Anyways, when they tried to go back to the old format during the next week, the Purple Slogmok (<a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=657">Week 657</a>), the template was...a little off.<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/Z55y6dP.png"><br><i>For some reason, Purple Slogmok was in bold font. This was the only time I found bold font in a PPL annoucement.</i></center><br><br>

The week after Purple Slogmok, <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=658">658</a>, the format went back to normal:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/rUvkV96.png"></center><br><br>

And with that, <b>the Spotted Warf starts off the Green Streak.</b> Which is simply a series of four consecutive glitched rounds of the PPL. These rounds awarded <b>340</b> separate glitched PPL trophy batches, <b>which makes up nearly 12% of all glitched PPL pets</b>.<br><br><center><table style="max-width: 50%;"><tr><td width="3%" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: top;">

	After the Marquan Floud was announced on June 28th, 2018, the PPL went on a one week break (likely to try to stop the double trophy bug), and returned on July 12th, 2018 for the Mutant Dragoyle. I believe all of these rounds are, at the very least, correlated with the changes to the New Features blurbs, if not caused by them. They occur too close together, and after a year with little to no issues. <b>Whenever they implement changes to the PPL, glitched rounds are almost always sure to follow.</b> Keep this in mind, <b>as the exact same trend will happen during the <a href="#blueweeks">Blue Weeks</a></b>

<h2>Happy Holidays, Part 2: Electric Boogaloo</h2>
So, during the previous section, <a href="#greenweeks">The Green Weeks</a> glitches seemed to go hand in hand whenever changes were implemented to the PPL. During the Green Weeks, those changes came in the form of creating more personalized New Features annoucements. Well, during the Blue Weeks, <b>these changes come in the form of the petpet being picked for special themed-rounds</b>! In this case, <b>Christmas</b>!<br><br>

On <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2018-12-03">December 6th, 2018</a>, the Christmas Angelpus was announced as the winner of the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=682">682nd</a> round of the Petpet Protection League. These little guys would begin a series of Christmas-themed petpets that would bring the month of December some holiday cheer.<br><br><center><table style="max-width: 50%;"><tr><td width="3%" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: top;">

This was actually the first time the JumpStart-run TNT tried to do a themed PPL. When JumpStart brought back the Petpet Protection League in 2017, I'm almost positive it ran on an automatic system. It would be set to randomly select a petpet, and it would spit out a generic <b>The Petpet Protection League is back for another weekly surprise...</b> New Features annoucement. When they started doing personalized New Features annoucements for each petpet, they had to turn off at least part of that automatic system. This was when we got the glitched <a href="#greenweeks">Green-Streak</a>. So, again, <b>when they had to stop this automatic system for these Christmas-themed weeks, things would get.... weird when they started it back up</b>.

<h2><a id="garooda">Post-Holiday Blues</a></h2>

After the Christmas-themed weeks in 2018, TNT and the PPL would take a long-holiday break until <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2019-01-07">January 10th, 2019</a>, when the Blue Garooda was announced as the winner of the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=685">685th</a> round of the PPL:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/7DNioJ9.png"></center><br><br><strong><b>PROBLEM:</b></strong> They Blue Garooda was <b>not</b> the winner of 685th round of the PPL...The Pink Bluna was. In fact, <b>the Blue Garooda has <strong>NEVER</strong> won the PPL</b>. This is the only time in the history of the PPL where a petpet was announced as the winner <b>but did not actually claim the victory</b>.<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/ilkkvpi.png"><br><i>Sorry lil' guy...</i></center><br><br>

Things would only get weirder about three weeks later when a long series of non-consecutive glitched rounds would take place.

<h2><a id="bluewave">The Blue Wave</a></h2>

On <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2019-01-28">January 31st, 2019</a>, three weeks after the holiday break and the bizarre Blue Garooda round, the Blue Lynins would kick off the glitched Blue Wave. The Blue Wave was a 9-week-long series of non-consecutive glitched rounds that happened between <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=688">Week 688</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=707">Week 707</a>.<br><br><center><table style="max-width: 80%;"><tr><td width="3%" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: top;">

The issues with Weeks 688 through 707 didn't stop with the glitched rounds. These weeks were... quite weird to say the least. One of the first issues was something we've never seen in the PPL in the past: twin release dates.<br><br>

Six petpets during these weeks <b>shared release dates with each other</b>, and most of the rounds with shared release dates were also <b>glitched trophy rounds</b>.<br><br><center><table style="max-width: 80%; text-align: center; vertical-align: top;"><tr><td><img src="http://imgur.com/1hLX1Cx.png"><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=688">Week 688</a></td>

	</tr></table><br><i>Of these guys, the only non-glitched trophy round was for the Babik. <strong>Fun fact</strong>: Babik is actually the ugliest out of all the petpets on Neopets.com</i></center><br><br>
	
I'm not entirely sure what would have caused this, but I have a theory TNT was trying to implement a new system for selecting PPL winners that took release date into account. It could also be a total coincidence, but the Rotweilie and Babik winning <b>a week apart</b> after having only been released <b>less than two months prior</b> is... suspicious. The Royal Scarabug and Royal Wadjet were also released extremely close to their PPL dates.<br><br>

Another strange thing about these weeks are possible table cutoffs. There are three rounds that only list <b>a single winner</b>. While that makes sense for new petpets like the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=692">Rotweilie</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=693">Babik</a> (also, let's be real, who's putting a Babik on their pets? lol), it makes far less sense for the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=697">Fire Uniocto</a>, who had been released <b>eleven years prior to its PPL date</b>.<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/UtGfXqJ.png"><br><i><strong>Jinda:</strong> Do they really expect us to believe only one user attached a Fire Uniocto during the span of <b>ELEVEN YEARS</b>???</i></center><br><br>

There's also a few rounds that appear to have other random table cut offs. For example, <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?limit=200&amp;place=704">Pink Wadjet</a> seems to cutoff at bronze trophy mark:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/VnyQ13I.png"><br><i>Bronze trophies are awarded to the 31st-70th oldest petpets. They're attached at a fairly consistent rate, so it seems unlikely that not a single Neopian would attach a Pink Wadjet for <b>5 and a half years</b>.</i></center><br><br>

There's one other thing I'll mention about the Blue Wave, and it relates to an individual petpet, who's week is especially bizarre: the Mutant Miamouse.

<h2><a id="miamouse">Of Mutant Miamouse and Men</a></h2>
<a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=699">Mutant Miamouse week</a>, which happened on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2019-04-15">April 18th, 2019</a>, was a strange little anomaly. There were two big standout's that <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=jokirs">Keagan</a> and I noticed while sifting through the data. The first was that <b>there were more glitched trophy receivers than there were pets on the High Score Table</b>, which hadn't happened since the <a href="#redweeks">23-week-streak during the Red Weeks</a>. The HST table lists 33 winners, but <b>34 pets were awarded glitched trophies</b>. Who was this mysterious extra pet?? The second strange thing about the Mutant Miamouse week was the fact that, according to our list, Mutant Miamouse only received 2 glitched trophies, but <b>nearly every winner on our list had 3 trophies total</b>! Well... nearly every winner except for one:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/y507Aji.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></center><br><br>

Meet <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=jexcora">Jexcora</a> the Shadow Cybunny, the only winner from the Mutant Miamouse week with 2 glitched trophies instead of 3! Jexcora was a mystery, and I had lots of questions about him. I was, thankfully, able to track down his owner, <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=i_love_troy_and_blac">Ariel</a>, through an external website. On the subject of Jexcora, she had this to say:<br><br><center><b>Jex was a lab ray pet, and when he turned to Cybunny thats when I decided to step back and transfer him to hihelloitsariel .. Jex was never a main pet I used on my original account, only as a lab rat. However sometimes I attach a petpet to my neopet, to transfer the petpet over to my side instead of just trading/sellin the petpet .. I have a hunch that I did this with Jex, I attached a miamouse to Jex, then when Jex was on my account I removed my miamouse and either it's in my inventory, or its attached to one of my other neopets now</b></center><br><br>

Sure enough, she was able to find the Mutant Miamouse in question attached to one of her <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=Grimter">other pets</a>:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/TK8hRyi.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></center><br><br><i><strong>Jinda</strong>: Shark, that's all well and good, but it doesn't explain why Jexcora has two trophies instead of three, or why his Mutant Miamouse wasn't included on the High Score Table.</i><br><br>

Ah, impatient as you are perceptive, my friend. Well, there was one other key detail about Mutant Miamouse week that Jexcora led me to realize: <b>the glitched trophies were dispersed on April 24th, 2019, six days after the <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2019-04-15">Mutant Miamouse PPL announcement</a>.</b> By this point in time, PPL trophies were being delivered the day before PPL announcements. If Mutant Miamouse were announced on April 18th, 2019, they should have received trophies on April 17th, 2019. <b>So why didn't they receive their trophies until April 24th?</b><br><br>

Well, the winners <b>DID</b> receive trophies on April 17th. Or I guess I should say, <b>almost</b> all the winners.<br><br><b>Because Jexcora didn't yet have a Mutant Miamouse attached on April 17th, 2019, he didn't receive a trophy from that date.</b> Which explains why he's the only pet with two trophies rather than three. Ariel must have attached the Miamouse at some point in time <b>between April 17th, 2019 and April 24th, 2019</b>. The High Score Table only displays the Mutant Miamice from the first date, meaning <b>Jexcora was the mystery pet who was left off</b>.<br><br>

It also means that the Mutant Miamouse round is the only other known instance of a PPL trophy dispersal being run twice besides <a href="#ukali">Blue Ukali</a>. This is why most Mutant Miamouse owners have <b>three trophies</b>–one unglitched trophy from the first dispersal date, and two glitched trophies from the second.<br><br>

I'm unsure why the trophies were run twice, but I do know they were delievered the same day as the trophies for the next week's winners: <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=700">Water Smiley</a>. If I had to guess, TNT just sent out an extra trophy batch to the Mutant Miamouse instead of the Water Smilies.<br><br>

I wanted to give a special thanks to <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=i_love_troy_and_blac">Ariel</a>, Jexcora's owner for helping me complete this section. Without her, I don't think I would have solved the Mutant Miamouse mystery!<br><br><center>

</center><br><br><h2>The Blue Wave Subsides</h2>

<a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=707">The Reptillor</a> was awarded a glitched set of 3-trophies on June 12th, 2019. And with that, our non-consecutive glitch streak comes to a close. It took them <b>nearly 5-months</b> to fix whatever was causing The Blue Wave. This is the last known instance of a glitch streak.

<h1>The <span style="color: #b1afd4;">Purple</span> Weeks<strong>JUNE 12TH, 2019-PRESENT DAY</strong></h1>

<h2>The End of Custom Announcements</h2>

As we learned during <a href="#greenweeks">The Green Weeks</a>, JumpStart started doing custom Petpet Protection League announcements on the New Features page on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2018-04-24">April 26th, 2018</a> for <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=651">Week 651</a>, the Custard Angelpuss. These personalized little blurbs would last nearly 3-years before coming to an abrupt hault.<br><br>

We get our very last personalized announcement on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2020-03-17">March 17th, 2020</a>:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/PFATDpl.png"><br><i>Farewell personalized PPL annoucements, you will be missed</i>

</center><br><br><i><strong>Jinda</strong>: Wait. March of 2020? Wasn't that when–</i><br><br>

WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT.<br><br><i><strong>Jinda</strong>: But–</i><br><br>

NOPE! IT WAS A SUPER NORMAL MONTH! EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT! THE BIRDS WERE BUZZING, THE BEES WERE SINGING. EVERYTHING WAS SUNSHINE AND RAINBOWS.<br><br>

Ahem. Excuse me. Moving on. After this we get a few weeks (746-749) of a different generic message that we haven't seen before:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/PMCTipP.png"></center><br><br>

Then, on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2020-04-20">April 23rd, 2020</a>, the PPL announcement returns to the same, generic blurb that we've come to know and love:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/c089dHO.png"><br><b>The Petpet Protection League is back for another weekly surprise as we announce our winner for Week <strong>XXX</strong> - <strong>(Petpet)</strong>!</b></center><br><br>

From this point on, I'm almost positive the Petpet Protection League has been entirely automatic. There are no unique blurbs, top names listed, or themed rounds. The contest gets almost no attention, and it exists as a shell of what it once was. Because the system is automatically run, there are incredibly few glitched rounds that occur during The Purple Weeks.

<h2>Purple Glitches</h2>

<center><img src="http://imgur.com/pTsQqq8.png"></center><br><br>

As you can see, there have been a measly two glitched rounds between 2019 and present day. This is less than any other era of the PPL. Because the Petpet Protection League is running entirely automatically, it means TNT isn't messing with it as much. This means there's far fewer chances for them to make the changes that result in glitched rounds.<br><br>

I can't find any discernible cause for the first glitched week of this era, the Fire Blobagus (<a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=826">Week 826</a>). These guys are a bit strange because they're the only instance after <a href="#orangeweek">The Orange Weeks</a> where <b>100% of the winners weren't awarded glitched trophies</b> (unless you also count <a href="#ukali">Blue Ukalis</a>, but technically speaking, 100% of the winners from the second date were glitched, the High Score Table was just weird). I have absolutely no idea what would have caused this, but I think <b>it may have to do with table cutoffs</b> that occurred during some rounds of the Purple Weeks. The Fire Blobagus <b>might</b> have had a table cutoff:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/gbh09DJ.png"><br><i>Fire Blobagus <b>seem</b> to have a cutoff after the Silver Trophy mark.</i></center><br><br>

According to <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=964">an editorial</a> <b>table cutoffs during this era are caused by the script failing to run completely</b>:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/Bx9FVf3.png"><br><i><strong>Jinda</strong>: Ah the ol' Meepit excuse. A classic.</i></center><br><br>

Our only other glitched winner of this era, the Water Intesteen (<a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=860">Week 860</a>), occurred one week prior to the Fire Hydruplits that were mentioned in this editorial, meaning they were likely the other table cutoff Aesop is referring to. <b>This further lends to my theory about table cutoffs and glitched rounds being correlated</b>.<br><br>

The three sets of glitched trophies awarded to Water Intesteen owners on June 15th, 2022 were the <b>last glitched trophies ever awarded</b>. Since then, the Petpet Protection League has remained fairly uneventful. <b>At least for the time being...</b><br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/aH85AHH.png"><br><i>Bye for now...</i></center><br><br><h2>New Developments</h2>

In June of 2023, it was announced that Neopets' parent company, Jumpstart, would be shut down by Netdragon. The fate of the entire site appeared to be up in the air, but on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2023-07-17">July 17th</a>, it was announced that Neopets would now be under independent ownership for the first time in nearly a decade.<br><br>

The first PPL under the new ownership went off without a hitch on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2023-07-17">July 20th, 2023</a>:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/vKycdBT.png"><br><i>The first PPL under the new ownership was awarded to the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=916">Faerie Spardel</a></i></center><br><br>

After this... the rounds started to get a little... funky.<br><br><i><strong>Jinda</strong>: Surprise, surprise...</i><br><br>

On <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2023-07-24">July 27th, 2023</a> there was no announcement for the winner of <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=917">Week 917, Gold Mauket</a>. I spoke with a user who won that week, and I was able to confirm the trophies for Gold Maukets were delivered on time and were unglitched.<br><br>

On <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2023-07-31">August 3rd, 2023</a>, the date the winners of Week 918 were supposed to be announced, we were instead greeted with this announcement:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/uVy9n1t.png"><br><i>This is the first time a late PPL has been communicated via New Features announcement. Historically, these announcements have come through Editorials.</i></center><br><br>

Two days later, on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2023-07-31">August 5th, 2023</a>, the PPL winner for <a href="//www.neopets.com/ppl.phtml?place=918">Week 918</a> is announced. TNT also includes the announcement for the Gold Mauket nine days late:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/ndyBEXr.png"><br><i>This is the first time in the history of the PPL that two petpets have shared a PPL announcement.</i></center><br><br>

Five days later, we get an announcement on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2023-08-07">August 10th, 2023</a> for the winner of Week 919: Yellow Gathow:<br><br><center><img src="http://imgur.com/HfhsTjT.png"></center><br><br>

Everything appears to be back on track schedule-wise and announcement-wise, but the Yellow Gathow week has a glaring issue: as of writing, the Yellow Gathow appears to lack a High Score Table. Week 919 currently doesn't exist. I will be checking back daily to see if or when it drops. This is the first time since the <a href="#garooda">Blue Garooda</a> that a petpet has not received a win after being announced in the New Features.<br><br>

If you have any additional information about any of these rounds (Week 916-Week 919), <a href="#directory">PLEASE contact Shark with any glitch leads.</a>

<b>Update as of 2/19/24:<br><br>

Hello! I'm so excited to be able to announce a new glitch-streak that may or may not be ongoing_  This streak began (as far as I'm aware of currently) with the Halloween Symol week on October 5th, 2023. Since then, I've been able to confirm at least 6 new glitch weeks. Most excitingly, these weeks have awarded the most trophies in PPL history, a record which was previously held by Skylde winners. Every single pet from these rounds have been awarded 50+ PPL trophies, with some totaling over 100 PPL trophies! Even stranger, these rounds have been awarding trophies continuously. So a pets that I have proof of having 45 trophies a month ago... now have over 90 trophies.<br><br>

I'm continuously doing research on these recent glitch rounds, and am taking my time to complete a write-up of my findings.<br><br>

I've been a little slower to update as of late. I haven't been spending as much time on Neopets, and it's been good for me. But I'm still dedicated towards keeping this directory occasionally updated. :3</b>

<h2>Farewell for now...</h2>



If you stuck around from beginning to end, I want to sincerly thank you. This niche little project took an insane amount of my time and effort, and it means a lot to me that you'd take the time to read through all this. I tried to make it as entertaining as possible, and I hope you enjoyed this tiny piece of Neopets history I tried to weave together.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">

<ul><li>Research, coding, and writing by me, <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?randomfriend=smartalecked">Shark</a>!</li>
	<li>Research, editing, coding help by <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?randomfriend=smartalecked">Keagan</a>! Thank you for the super rad, animated Mutant Miamouse art! And just all your help in general. You're the raddest.</li>
	
	<li>Base layout by user <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?randomfriend=coco_bella">coco_bella</a>, who has since noped off Neo. Their original can be found on my <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Elukiar">old 2014 portfolio</a>. If you want that code, I put it there, but you have to use my old high school cringe as your base (you're welcome ;3). Make sure you leave coco_bella's credit, or mention they made it somewhere.</li>
	
	<li>Thank you to <a href="/~Actuality">The Glitch Index</a> and <a href="/~Darkiro">Neopian Antiques and Oddities</a> for their information on the PPL glitch and its existence.</li>
	
	<li>Special thanks to <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=nightter">Night</a> for allowing me to interview her about Kluc, and for the lovely Blue Ukali Art</li>
