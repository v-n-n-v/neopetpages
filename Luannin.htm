<h3>★ Hi there!!</h3>
Nice to see you here, in my little Habi Corner ^^ My name is Luannin, and Mom put me in charge of her Habitarium. I'm here to teach you a few things about Habitariums, from the basics of the game to much more specific things! If you have any questions, you can always neomail <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=black_heart_nemesis">Mom</a>, or go to the <a href="/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=39">Habi Chat</a>, and ask your question on the Q&amp;A thread there - don't be shy! ^^<br><br></td></tr></table><table width="1000"><tr><td valign="top">
<h3>★ What is Habitarium</h3>
<a href="/habitarium/">Habitarium</a> (habi) is a game in which you take care of petpetpets (p3s). You make them do chores and gain experience points (exp). For every level you get in-game-rewards and nps. (<a href="/~ColdWeatherPingGing">Quick Ref</a>) Lv.50 is the highest level. Getting there earns a total of 503k nps. Once at level 50, depending on how efficient you play, you could make about 60-80k nps a day on average. The game starts with an easy tutorial, is generally not difficult to play, and does not need non-stop attention from you.

<h3>★ P3s: species, job-types, &amp; more</h3>
</td></tr></table><table><tr><td valign="top">
<b>☆ Species:</b> There's three species of p3 in the game: mootix, pinchits, and larnikins. The different species are just for the purpose of variation: how good they are at certain chores depends on their job-type, not on their species. You are free to decide whether you want to keep all three species, only two, or even only one.<br><br></td>
<td width="230" valign="top">
<img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/hot_poison/Luannin/Species.gif"></td>
</tr></table><table width="1000"><tr><td valign="top">
<i>☆ Stats:</i> Clicking on a p3 will give you more info in the Info Bubble (its species, job-type, stats, lifespan, etc). The state it's in is indicated by three stats: health (a heart), hunger (fork &amp; knife), and sleep (Zz).<br>
• If the health-bar depletes to a dangerously low level, the p3 gets a heart thought-bubble, and should be placed in a house/hospital/barrack asap to heal. If it depletes completely (from pest attack or raid) the p3 will die.<br>
• If the hunger- and/or sleep-bars deplete to a very low level, they'll get a fork &amp; knife and/or Zz thought-bubble. If these bars are both completely depleted, the p3 will stop working and fall asleep on the ground. This does NOT restore their bars again, they'll need to be placed in a house/hospital/barrack for that.<br><br></td></tr></table><table width="1000"><tr><td width="850" valign="top">
<b>☆ Job-types:</b> There are three job-types: worker, nester, and soldier. Each species can have p3s of each job-type:<br>
• Workers can do the following chores: Harvesting resources, building/repairing structures, fighting (only if a pest directly attacks the resource they're harvesting).<br>
It is best to let workers ONLY harvest. Their hunger- and sleep-bar deplete in about 8 hours of harvesting.<br>
• Nesters can do the following chores: Nesting, harvesting resources, fighting (only if a pest directly attacks the resource they're harvesting).<br>
It is best to let nesters ONLY nest. The hunger- and sleep-bar of nesting nesters barely depletes; if you put them in a house/hospital through at least one 30-second-game-update, while dealing with their eggs after each egg-cycle, their bars remain almost full their entire lives.<br>
• Soldiers can do the following chores: Fighting, building/repairing structures.<br>
It is best to let soldiers do all the building/repairing of structures (so workers can keep on harvesting). Their hunger- and sleep-bar deplete in about 6 hours.<br><br><table><tr><td width="90">
<center><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/hot_poison/Luannin/PassinOn.gif"></center>
     </td>
<td valign="top">
<i>☆ Lifespan:</i> P3s have a natural lifespan of 7 days. So regardless of how you take care of them, they will die of 'old age' 7 days after they were either hatched or given to you by the prof. This means every week you have to keep repopulating your habi with new p3s. P3s do not die from being hungry or tired. They can only die prematurely if their health-bar reaches zero, which can only happen from fighting pests or a friend's soldiers. When a p3 dies, it leaves behind a diamond-like gem. Depending on how long the p3 had lived, clicking a p3-death-gem will give you either 50 exp (if it was in the first half of its lifespan-bar), 100 exp (if it was in the second half), or 150 exp (if it had lived out its full lifespan).<br>
→ Note: Should you completely run out of living nesters, the prof will give you a new one. You receive the new living nester (of random species) either immediately after your last living nester dies (while the game is opened), or upon reopening the game after your last living nester died while the game was closed. If you were, on the moment he gives you the new nester, already out of workers and/or soldiers, he THEN also gives you one random species p3 of each job-type you were missing (<a href="/~Rimzin#scr01">screenies</a>).

</td>
</tr></table><table width="1000"><tr><td valign="top">
<b>☆ P3 Upgrades:</b> Reaching levels 11 and 31 will allow you  to upgrade your p3s, to make them more efficient at their various chores (harvest more, nest faster, etc). This goes per job-type, meaning: upgrading one soldier will upgrade all current and all future soldiers. So you only need to upgrade 3 p3s (1 of each job-type) to upgrade your entire population, and it's permanent.<br>
P3 upgrades are extremely cheap and very important, so there is no reason not to do it. Upgrading your entire population to level 3 (so all workers, all soldiers, all nesters first to lv.2, then to lv.3) permanently, costs a total of ONLY 165 pollen, 330 water, and 165 grass.

<td valign="top">
<i>☆ Harvesting resources:</i> Making your p3s collect the resources that are the main currency in this game.<br>
To make a p3 harvest something, pick them up and drag them to a tile directly adjacent to a resource tile. Once they start harvesting that resource, they will not stop until you place them elsewhere.<br>
Workers harvest units every 30 seconds, nesters harvest units every 60 seconds; so nesters should never harvest.<br><br></td>
</tr></table><table width="1000"><tr><td valign="top">
<b>☆ Nesting:</b> Making your p3s lay and incubate eggs, so that you can keep repopulating your habi with new p3s – only nesters can do this chore. To make a nester nest, pick it up and drag it onto a nest. It should lay an egg within minutes, indicated by a progress bar that shows up under it. (If it doesn't, refresh to make sure the game registered you placing the nester on the nest, if needed, replace the nester on the nest until it does register, more on lag issues under <a href="/~Neshiri#mis">Issues &amp; Glitches</a>)<br>
→ Note: The species of the egg is always the same as that of the nester that laid the egg, but any other nester can finish incubating it (so should a nester die before it finished incubating its egg, you can let another nester finish it).<br><br></td>

</td>
<td valign="top">
<i>☆ Building and repairing:</i> To use a structure you've bought, it must be built first. To build it, open your bag and drag the structure onto your field. The default status of an unbuilt structure will always say "Being Built", but it will not build itself. Drag your soldiers or workers to a tile directly adjacent to the structure to make them build it.<br>
Structures will decay over time, a little bit every day, so they'll need to be repaired; this works exactly the same as building a structure: just place the p3s beside it.<br>
As workers should be allowed to constantly harvest resources to continuously make exp from that, and soldiers just walk around waiting for pests to randomly spawn, let only your soldiers build and repair.<br><br></td>
</tr></table><table width="1000"><tr><td valign="top">
<b>☆ Fighting:</b> This is not a chore you have to manually set your p3s to do. If your habi gets attacked (either by pests or through a raid) any soldiers that are in the field will go to them and fight them. (If you want your soldiers to fight pests in a different order than they are doing, you can of course pick them up and drop them by a different pest.) Workers and nesters only do it if the resource they're harvesting is directly targeted by pests, they will not seek pests out by going to them like soldiers do, and they will not fight in raids at all.<br>
Soldiers usually cannot see pests that attack your nests, and will not fight them. <a href="/~Rimzin#blo">Blocking</a> your nests solves that issue though.

<h3>★ Eggs</h3>
Eggs are vital in this game; as said p3s die each week, so each week you have to hatch new ones to replace them. While leveling up, you get an egg (of random species &amp; random job-type) as level-up reward for reaching every even level, which isn't nearly enough to keep repopulating, so you'll need to have at least one nester of each species you want to keep in your habi nesting all the time.<br><br>
Laying an egg takes only a minute or so, incubation times depend on the level of both the nester and the nest (varying from two hours for a lv.1 nester on a lv.1 nest, to 50 minutes for a lv.3 nester on a lv.3 nest).<br>
Incubation is complete when the egg's progress bar is completely filled, and upon lifting up the nester the egg will wobble and wiggle in the nest. Once it is, clicking the egg will tell you what species/job-type is in it (if your population is not maxed out), and give you a maximum of three options, in the Info Bubble:<br>
• Harvest <img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/hot_poison/Luannin/eggHarvest.gif"> will place the egg in your bag, for later use.<br>
• Hatch <img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/hot_poison/Luannin/eggHatch.gif"> will give you a new p3, and 30 exp.<br>
• Discard <img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/hot_poison/Luannin/eggDiscard.gif"> will throw the egg away permanently, and give you 200 exp.<br>
(If your population IS maxed out you will only have the options to harvest or discard, and it will not show the egg's species/job-type - to see that you then have to harvest the egg first, and hover over the eggs in your bag to see what types you have)<br><br>
As your nesters can, at best, only produce one egg each per 50 minutes, you've gotta harvest plenty of eggs to be able to always repopulate quickly. When p3s die, you want your population back to full strength as soon as possible.<br>
It's recommended to keep at least once your population (so the same amount of each species/job-type combo as you have alive) in eggs in your bag, though many players keep twice that, just in case of emergencies. That way you will be sure you ALWAYS have enough eggs to completely rebuild your entire population, no matter what.<br>
→ Tip 1: If you want to get many eggs of a certain species fast, but have only one nester of that species: let that one nester lay an egg in every nest you have, but only let it incubate the last it's laid, while your other nesters (at the same time) incubate the other eggs. (Make sure to refresh in between taking one nester off a nest, and placing another nester on that nest, to make sure the first really WAS off the nest and thus prevent getting two nesting nesters stuck on the same nest - more on lag issues under <a href="/~Neshiri#mis">Issues &amp; Glitches</a>)<br>
→ Tip 2: Make sure you deal with an egg (harvest/hatch/discard) in time. Once an egg is fully incubated but left on the nest for too long, the p3 inside will break out of it and escape your habi, leaving you with an empty egg-shell, which you can only discard (10 exp).<br><br>
→ NOTE! While there are eggs in your nests, the top corner of your habi (the 0x0) will act occupied: it'll show a move icon when you open your bag - even if nothing is there, and you won't be able to place any items on that tile. While your nests have no eggs, the 0x0 will be available again.<br><br></td></tr></table></div>

<div style="width: 1036px; height: 433px; overflow: auto;">
<table width="1000"><tr><td valign="top">
<h3>★ Structures &amp; Foods</h3>
All structures are bought and upgraded with wood, mud, and stone (<a href="/~ColdWeatherPingGing">Quick Ref</a>), with the exception of NC items. Structures must be upgraded individually. Building each structure awards 200 exp, upgrading each structure awards 300 exp per upgrade.<br>
Structures decay a little bit every day, and can also be damaged by pests or raids. Except for storages, decayed/damaged structures become less efficient at what they do (restore p3-bars slower, incubate eggs slower). You can let your soldiers (or workers) repair them (awards 5 exp per repaired level of decay), or buy hammers to repair one or two levels of decay yourself (rewards no exp). Structures never disappear from damage/decay.<br>
Clicking on a structure will tell you its name, level, and state (from perfect to broken), as well as give you the options to reset ink, and upgrade.<br><br><b>☆ Houses:</b> Placing p3s in a house (drag the p3 ON the house and drop it in) will restore all three of their bars: health, hunger, and sleep, in only a few minutes. P3s do not come out by themselves once fully healed, you'll have to take them out yourself by clicking on the house (the p3s that are inside will pop up), then dragging the p3s back on the field one by one.<br>
A lv.1 house holds 3 p3s at once, lv.2 holds 5, and lv.3 holds 7 at once.<br>
Seven lv.3 houses can hold your entire population at level 50, all at once.<br><br><i>☆ Hospitals:</i> Work the exact same as houses, but restore bars a tad bit quicker, and hold far less p3s at once.<br>
A lv.1 hospital holds 2 p3s at once, lv.2 holds 3, and lv.3 holds 4 at once.<br>
Hospitals are not a necessity in the game.<br><br><b>☆ Barracks:</b> Work the exact same as houses, but restore bars a tad bit quicker, and can only hold soldiers. They can also not be upgraded to lv.3 (yet).<br>
A lv.1 barrack holds 3 soldiers, and a lv.2 barrack holds 5 soldiers at once.<br>
Barracks are not a necessity in the game.<br><br><i>☆ Storages:</i> Your storages in the field are like your in-game wallet. Any resources stored in them can be used in the shop to buy things with. When you place filled storages into your bag, the resources stay in them safely, but cannot be spent until you place the storage back in the field. Discarding a full storage from your bag, will also discard all resources inside.<br>
Harvested resources automatically go into storages in the field that still have room for them, and resources you spend in the shop are automatically taken out. Clicking on a storage will tell you how much of each resource is in it - numbers in white means there is still room for more, numbers in green means there's no more room for that resource.<br>
A lv.1 storage holds 2500 of each resource, a lv.2 holds 3500 of each, and a lv.3 storage holds 4500 of each resource.<br>
Most players keep anywhere between 10-20 storages in their field. (Though if you want to keep your habi opened over night at level 50, 6-10 is a better number to avoid Gem Lockout - more on Lockouts under <a href="/~Neshiri#mis">Issues &amp; Glitches</a>)<br><br><b>☆ Nests:</b> Nesters have to be in a nest in order to lay eggs. Just drag the nester over and drop it on the nest. You should have one designated nest for each nester, and always place each nester (back) on the same nest its entire life, OR refresh after taking nesters off the nests, but before placing nesters back on the nests, to ensure you won't accidentally get two nesters stuck on the same nest (more on lag issues under <a href="/~Neshiri#mis">Issues &amp; Glitches</a>).<br><br><i>☆ Foods:</i> Food is NOT a necessity in the game, in fact, you should never buy it to feed your p3s. It just gets eaten, and then you have to keep buying more, which is a waste of time and resources, considering houses will take care of all 3 bars at once, and can be reused over and over.<br>
(The only situation in which it COULD be useful, is when you leave you habi opened overnight - you could then leave out some foods for your soldiers, though there's no guarantee they will eat it in time.)<br>
There are three types of food in the game, to restore the three different bars of your p3:<br>
• Small, Medium, and Large Droplet of Nectar restore health.<br>
• Cornmeal, Speck of Cheese, and Bacon Crumb restore hunger.<br>
• Apple Bite, Candy Sprinkle, and Bit of Berry Jelly restore sleep (energy).<br>
These are bought with water, pollen, and grass. (There is also an NC equivalent for each type of food: Magical Mini Honeycomb for health, Magical Meatball for hunger, Magical Marshmallow for sleep, and Pluburb Magical Seeds for all three bars at once.)<br><br></td></tr></table></div>

<h3>★ Resource tiles</h3>
The three most important resources are wood, mud, and stone. You will need these three for almost everything, so focus your harvesting mostly on these. There's also water, pollen, and grass. You will need these three as well, but in very, very, very small quantities, so don't waste too much time at all collecting these.<br></td></tr></table><table width="1000"><tr><td width="300" valign="top">
• Wood is harvested from trees.<br>
• Mud is harvested from mud bogs.<br>
• Stone is harvested from rocks.<br>
• Pollen is harvested from flowers.<br>
• Grass is harvested from grass.<br>
• Water is harvested from water-pumps.<br></td>

<td width="400" valign="top">
<br><br>Some resource tiles change appearance slightly with every refresh (eg. the flower changes color, the rock changes size, etc), this is just for variation and doesn't mean anything. However, resource tiles CAN get damaged by pests, and then they'll look broken/wilted (only on the water there is no visible difference).<br><br>
P3s will not harvest from damaged resources, so it's important to keep them in good health. You cannot repair your own resources, but damaged resources will repair themselves 3 hours after they were damaged (unless they get damaged again in the meantime), or you can ask a NF, or a Gifter on the <a href="/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=39">Habi Chat</a>, to repair your resources for you.<br>
Resource tiles will not 'run out' from continuous harvesting – only pests or raids can damage them.<br><br>
A good way to protect your resource tiles would be to block them (<a href="/~Rimzin#blo">Blocking Guide</a>). Resource tiles that are fully blocked can never be attacked and damaged by pests.

<h3>★ Decorations &amp; Inks</h3>
In essence, decorations have no special purposes other than to be decorative, items to make your habi look prettier.<br>
They can be put to use, though, to block/fence things off (more on that under <a href="/~Rimzin#blo">Blocking</a>).<br>
It is NOT recommended to have too many decorations in your habi, as the more decorations, the more lag they will give you, especially the animated ones (click <a href="/~gupppppppy#two">here</a> to see which decorations are animated, and which are not). Best to keep any decorations/blockings to a minimum – don't add more than you need (especially if lag is already an issue; more on lag in <a href="/~Neshiri#mis">Issues &amp; Glitches</a>).<br><br>
Inks are purely decorational, but can be used to organise your habi, too (eg. red nest for the larnikin nester, blue nest for the mootix nester, yellow houses for pinchit workers, red storage means full storage, etc, etc).<br><br></td></tr></table></div>

<h3>★ The Difference between Pests &amp; Raids</h3>
</td></tr></table><table width="1000"><tr><td valign="top">
<b>☆ Pest Attack:</b> Pest attacks will happen randomly, only while your habi is opened, and they are a built-in part of the game. Pests (the little blue bugs) can spawn on any unoccupied tile in your habi, and will then navigate to whichever (unprotected) resource tile, structure, egg, or food that is near them, and start 'eating away' at it. If they get to do this to it long enough, they'll damage the item/resource tile they attacked; Structures will lose a few levels of decay/damage, resources become temporarily unusable for harvesting, eggs' incubation bars are set back, etc.<br>
Any soldiers that are out in the field will seek out the pests as soon as they spawn and fight them. Every pest they defeat before the attack is over will turn into a red gem, worth 30 exp.
</td>
<td>
<center><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/hot_poison/Luannin/PeAt03.gif"></center>
</td>
</tr><tr></tr></table><table width="1000"><tr><td valign="top">
Though pest attacks happen randomly, certain things can attract them more frequently: having food out in the field (they seem to especially like a Bacon Crumb), and any activity by you (having your bag opened, moving p3s/items around, building/upgrading things, etc).<br>
As long as your habi is well protected, pests shouldn't be feared - they'll just give you some extra exp! However, should they come at a more awkward time (eg. you're just hatching eggs, your soldiers are just resting, or you have no soldiers at all, etc), you can always just refresh to make them go away, providing you refresh before the last pest is defeated/disappears. Because the results of the attack (injuries, damages, and red-gem-exp) don't get permanently registered into the game until right AFTER the attack (if you have the sound on, it's when you hear the sound of damages, sometimes also called the 'hiss' or 'scream' sound), refreshing BEFORE the attack is over, will reload the game as if the whole attack never happened: no damages, injuries, and no exp from any red gems you might've clicked during the attack that you then 'refreshed away'.<br><br><i>☆ Raiding:</i> This is done by players, not by the game. You can only raid/be raided by your friends in habi, and only when the habi being raided is not opened.<br>
• Raider: To raid one of your friends, find their username in your friend-bar, and click on the sword-icon. Select how many of your soldiers you want to send. A raid will take about 7-8 minutes, during which the soldiers you sent out will not be able to protect your habi, should pests appear. (Your population will drop, as well, but don't hatch more p3s: that's considered taking advantage of a glitch, something TNT does not appreciate.) If your raid was successful, upon your soldiers' return (those that survived, at least) a message will pop up with the results of the raid: How many of your friend's resource tiles they damaged, how many structures they damaged, how many of your friend's soldiers died, how many of your soldiers died, and what resources your soldiers looted from your friend.<br>
• Raidee: If you were raided by one of your friends while your habi was closed, upon opening your habi a message will pop up telling you who raided you, and what the results were (similar to those mentioned for the raider).<br><br>
Most players do NOT appreciate being raided, so before you do it to one of your friends, make sure that they are okay with it - if they are not, respect their wishes and don't raid them. A lot of players will delete or even block people who raid them against their wishes, and though raiding IS a legit part of the game, ask yourself if losing a friend, and all their potential habi-help, is really worth the few resources you might get out of it.<br><br></td></tr></table></div>

• Taking care of a p3 - though it says "worker", it will restore all 3 bars on any one random p3 to full.<br>
• Repairing a structure - though it says "house", it will restore any one random structure to perfect condition.<br>
• Repairing all resources - restores all resource tiles to perfect condition (the "100" does not mean this costs you anything, it just means 100%; all help you give is free).
</td>
<td width="300">
<center><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/hot_poison/Luannin/Helps01.gif"></center>
</td>
</tr></table><table width="1000"><tr><td valign="top">
You can help out each friend once per 24 hours (meaning after you helped a friend, you cannot help that friend again for 24 hours). Each help you give earns you 50 exp. Repairing resource tiles is usually most preferred, as it is the only thing you cannot repair yourself in your own habi.<br><br><i>☆ Gifting:</i> Clicking the gift-box icon will open your bag, as well as a window in which you can drag an item from your bag, to gift to your friend. Just like helping, gifting can be done once per friend per 24 hours.<br>
→ Note: For some reason, if you send a friend a regular, non-habi item, habi counts this as your 'once per 24 hours'-gift in habi, and then will not let you send that friend a gift in habi for the next 24 hours after sending the regular item. So if you want to send both, make sure to send the habi item first - as there's no limit to how many normal items you can send to friends, so you can still send them as many regular items as you like, after sending the habi item.<br><br>
On the <a href="/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=39">Habi Chat</a> you'll see a LOT of Gifting threads; these are usually hosted by higher leveled players, who at that point in the game have great excesses of resources - more than they need. In order to keep emptying their storages, they chose to buy and gift items to lower leveled players (who usually still have big shortages of resources), so that their workers can keep on harvesting, making them more exp/nps. Asking them (on their own topics) for habi gifts is not considered rude (just make sure to respect their wishes and follow their personal rules on friending, unfriending, raiding, etc - more on Habi Chat Etiquette <a href="/~Neshiri#eti">here</a>), and is beneficial for both giftee and gifter alike.<br><br></td></tr></table></div>

<h3>★ Lv 50</h3>
</td></tr></table><table width="1000"><tr><td valign="top">
Right now level 50 is the maximum level you can reach in habi. There are 'preparations' in place in the game already for when more levels will be added (eg. storages cannot be upgraded to lv.4 until you'd reach level 67, houses cannot be upgraded to lv.4 until level 59, etc), but as of yet there is no word on when (and IF) new levels will actually be added.
</td>
<td width="175">
<center><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/hot_poison/Luannin/expbar02.gif"></center>
</td>
</tr></table><table width="1000"><tr><td valign="top">
Up to level 50, you only earn nps by leveling up (a little more each level, adding up to a total of 503,450 nps).<br>
Once you've reached the max level, however, in order to still earn nps, your exp-bar changes to a purple bar that fills up to 1000 exp, over and over. Every time you have earned 1000 exp and thus fill that exp-bar, a purple gem appears in your habi. Clicking a purple gem gives you 500 nps. Depending on how efficient your habi is set up, how long you leave it opened each day, if you put in any extra effort for extra exp (like tips #6 and #10 on <a href="/~Neshiri#lev">Tips to Leveling</a>), etc, you could make anywhere from 20-150k a day, some people even manage up to 180k (average is about 50-110k).<br>
Basically, at lvl.50 you keep doing what you've always been doing: make as much exp as possible (good guide <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Phieso">here</a>). At this point you should have everything upgraded as far as you could, and have all the structures you need set up in an efficient way; so if anything your habi will need even less maintenance. Many people create a "Hatching Day" (also called "Dying day"), meaning they make it so each week they hatch out their entire population on the same day, so that each week all p3s die on the same day, as well. This also makes your habi be lower-maintenance; you only have to worry about hatching once a week, and you have a more accurate knowledge of what eggs are in your bag (more on how to set this up under <a href="/~Neshiri#swe">Getting Rid of P3s</a>).<br><br>
There is one thing you have to be mindful of, though, and that is that purple gems cannot stack (like p3-death-gems and the red pest gems can). If your habi accumulates more purple gems than you have room for, and is then made to reload (by you refreshing, your computer restarting, shockwave crashing, etc), you'll get a Gem Lockout (more on Lockouts under <a href="/~Neshiri#mis">Issues &amp; Glitches</a>).<br><br></td></tr></table></div>

<h3>★ Job-ratios</h3>
An ideal job-ratio depends on how you (can) play. There's three most common ways, described below. In any scenario, though, it is wise to leave one spot open in your population (so keeping 27/28 p3s, or 45/46, etc), so you can see what species/job-type is in an egg without having to harvest it first - when your population is full, clicking on an egg in the field/nest will not tell you what is inside. You'd then have to first harvest it and go over all eggs in your bag, to find out what it was - very time consuming.
<br><br><b>☆ The Worker-way:</b> When it comes to making exp, harvesting resources is the fastest and most continuous way – once p3s are harvesting a resource they will keep doing that, without any supervision or additional required actions by you. That said, this does require the game to remain opened – once closed, all harvesters will only earn 10 exp each, then stop.<br>
A lv.3 worker harvests about 300 exp per hour, a lv.3 nester harvests about 200 exp per hour, at best (so again: don't let nesters harvest).<br>
Discarding one egg earns 200 exp, the egg taking 50 minutes to incubate (lv.3 nester on a lv.3 nest). If you discard it on the dot every 50 minutes, the worker will have still made 250 exp in the same time.<br>
So, if you can leave your habi opened (from a few hours while you're on – 24/7 if you can/want) it is most efficient to have a population of mostly workers, harvesting resources all the time (except for the few minutes every +/- 8 hours that they'll need to be housed to restore their bars).<br>
With a well-blocked habi, you won't need more than 2-3 soldiers. Using the Worker-way, you also want to cut down on nesters as much as possible, but how much depends on how many of their egg-cycles you can catch while you're on each day. If you know you can catch most and throughout a considerable portion of the day, you only need one nester of each species you want to keep in your habi, to still be able to harvest enough eggs to repopulate every week. If you can't catch that many egg-cycles, try 2 nesters of each species. (This is something you have to check out for yourself by just trying it over the course of 1-3 weeks; and then stick with the lowest possible number of nesters while still being able to harvest back your entire population in eggs in one week or a little less.)<br>
All other p3s should be workers (minus leaving that one spot open, of course).<br><br><i>☆ The Nester-way:</i> If you cannot leave habi opened throughout the day, but CAN check in briefly from time to time every day, mostly nesters is a better option for you. If your habi is closed most of the time, harvesting resources will hardly earn you anything, but as egg incubation continues while the game is closed, you'll at least be able to discard a whole bunch of eggs every time you check in.<br>
Once you're at level 50, you could even do with no soldiers as with habi closed most the time, pests are not an issue anyway. (Just make sure you DO still keep at least some soldier-eggs, just in case). You will also still need a few workers to repair all your nests and/or harvest resources to buy hammers.<br>
The Nester-way obviously won't earn as much as the Worker-way, but if you simply cannot leave habi opened, it's just the next best thing to still make a decent amount.<br><br><b>☆ The Hybrid-way:</b> This is for those who are less concerned by a stable income each week, and/or have very varying schedules of when they can/cannot be on a lot. It's basically a combination of both the Worker- and Nester-way:<br>
One week: only nesters – harvesting most eggs so you'll have an egg-supply in your bag that can last for several weeks of hatching new populations, without having to nest and harvest more eggs during those weeks. (Be selective about the eggs you harvest, though, DO harvest enough of each type you'll need, without over-hoarding and risking Bag Lockout; more on Lockouts under <a href="/~Neshiri#mis">Issues &amp; Glitches</a>.)<br>
Next few weeks: 2-3 soldiers (to build nests for extra exp to keep emptying the storages) and the rest workers (harvesting resources).<br>
When after a few weeks the egg supply is starting to grow thin, you have a Nester-week again, and so on.<br>
This way doesn't provide a reliable weekly income, so if you know you will be around most the time every week, and leave habi opened a lot every week, the Worker-way would still be better. The Hybrid-way is, like the Nester-way, just a second-best method if you know the Worker-way won't be efficient for you.<br><br></td></tr></table></div>

<h3>★ NeoCash</h3>
Some items in the in-game shop are bought with NC, instead of resources. (List of all items, including NC-items, <a href="/~gupppppppy">here</a>.)<br>
NONE of these items are necessary in the game, most are even purely decorational (eg. backgrounds, decorations, ink-bottles and -droppers), so buying them is personal choice. (Ink bottles paint structures, and that WILL last - unless you discard the structure.)<br>
• Ink-droppers will paint p3s. You get 10 drops per Dropper, each drop will paint one p3. When this p3 dies (after 7 days), that ink-drop is gone, too, and in case of nesters: they do NOT pass their new color on to their offspring.<br>
• A lot of NC items can cause extra lag in your habi.<br>
• Too much NC items in your habi has also been linked to potentially causing WID Lockouts (more on Lockouts under <a href="/~Neshiri#mis">Issues &amp; Glitches</a>).<br>
• NC is bought with real money. Spend it very wisely :)
