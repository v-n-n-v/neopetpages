</p>
<br><br><br><p>I am not an artist. I am, however, fairly good at YYB. This guide is going to try and help you figure out how to play this game. It's not going to be prettiest guide out there, but it might just be the most helpful.</p>
<p>With that said, if anyone wants to make me a neato page for this guide, hit me up with a neomail :o</p>
<br><br><br><p><font size="5"><b>Start of the game</b></font></p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gECGS87.png"><br><br><p>This picture assumes you are in the 1+3 format, but you can do this with any of the three formations. While it seems tempting to just go straight for the Yooyu as soon as you can move, that's not the smartest move. What you should do is wait for the opponent to grab the Yooyu first, then steal it from them as soon as they grab it.
<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/da0TwuE.png"><br><br>You want stand around there. Right above where the Yooyu sits, but not close enough that you grab the Yooyu. As soon as you see the AI grab the Yooyu, steal it from them by tackling down.
<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/eBvo0lb.png"><br><br>Your player's position should look similar to this. After that tackle, this usually makes the AI move in really weird ways. I'd say about 70-80% of the time, you are in perfect position to get into scoring position with absolutely no interference from the AI. Now where are your shooting positions? This depends mainly your controls.
<br><br><br><br><font size="5"><b>Scoring Positions</b></font>
<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/rIlUZ4f.png"><br><br>You're probably wondering what you're looking at. The areas the players are standing at are what I like to call the scoring sweetspots in this game. If you have your shooting bar charged to full, your shot will go in all the time, outside some very rare occasions. When there's a scramble situation because you missed your shot, the AI moved differently and intercepted you, you missed your tackle, etc, just remember these spots. Knowing where you can score will help minimize the time you waste, giving you more opportunities to score in a game.
<br><br><b>Dinksy's (Shoyru's) Spot:</b> I have heard from some players that they cannot move while charging up their shoot, shoot the Yooyu while moving, and/or shoot the Yooyu diagonally while moving. I am fairly incompetent when it comes to computers, but I believe it's a problem based on your keyboard. This is still possible to do with the mouse controls, so if you cannot pull this off with keyboard controls, try and see if you can get comfortable with the mouse controls. If you are incapable of shooting diagonally due to faulty keyboard controls/cannot get used to mouse controls...this spot is basically useless for you.
<br><br>For the rest of you, congratulations. This spot is, by far, where I score the majority of my points. After stealing the Yooyu at the start of the tipoff, you can hug the wall in the bottom and just move to this spot, usually with little to no interference from the AI. The idea is to start charging up your shot after stealing the Yooyu and as you're moving to this spot. As soon as you reach this spot, shoot towards the opposing goal. The Yooyu will pass right by the goalie and hit the top edge of the goal net.
<br><br>The main reason why this is the best spot to shoot from in the game is mainly due to the AI's reaction after getting the Yooyu stolen at the start of the game. If you do what I instructed, most of the time, the AI players like to crowd the middle of the field. This generally leaves the bottom of the field empty/poorly defended, which lets you reach this spot and score with ease.
<br><br>You can score in this spot with every Yooyu except the Faerie Yooyu. Note the Mutant Yooyu randomly curves and the Darigan Yooyu only goes in the right direction 12.5% of the time.
<br><br><b>The Blue Box:</b> The Blue Box shoots the Yooyu at the same angle as Dinksy's spot, but I make note of it for one reason: it's the best spot to shoot the Ice Yooyu from. Due to the Ice Yooyu's slow traveling speed and the fact it travels a shorter distance, that spot is there to compensate for both factors. If you have the Ice Yooyu, try to shoot from this spot, as shooting it from Dinksy's spot does get it intercepted by the AI sometimes. Should be obvious, but since it lets the Yooyu travel at the same angle, you can use the same Yooyus that work in Dinksy's spot here.
<br><br><b>Hawkshanks' (Quiggle's) Spot/Line:</b> The most consistent spot to score if you cannot shoot diagonally. If you choose this method of scoring, stealing the Yooyu by tackling down-right puts you in a better position to reach this spot. The spot that Hawkshanks is standing in is the max distance that you can be away from the goal to get a successful shot to hit all the time (barring the Yooyu getting intercepted by an opposing player as its heading towards the goal). As long as you are standing on Hawkshanks' spot or standing on the red line and shoot straight, your shot will go in, just hitting the bottom of the goalie net. 
<br><br>You can score in this spot with every Yooyu except the Faerie Yooyu. Note the Mutant Yooyu randomly curves and the Darigan Yooyu only goes in the right direction 12.5% of the time.
<br><br><b>Nitri's (Moehog's) Spot:</b> Basically Hawkshanks' spot, except you're aiming towards the top of the goalie net instead of the bottom. I've personally found it to be kind of finicky sometimes compared to Hawkshanks' spot for some reason. Good spot to keep in mind during scramble situations.
<br><br><b>Zayle's (Grundo's) Spot:</b> He's in the bottom right corner if you couldn't find him :U
<br><br>This is the spot where you go to shoot the Darigan Yooyu. If you're wondering how the Darigan Yooyu actually works, when you shoot it, it shoots off in one of 8 directions: North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest. So you only have a 12.5% chance of it going in the direction you want it to. By locking yourself in the bottom right corner, your chances of scoring goes up to 25%. If the Yooyu goes straight up or straight down when you are in the corner, it will actually go in right behind the goalie's back.
<br><br>However, here is a bit of a warning. <b>The goalie likes to move around and fidget around. One of the areas he fidgets around is right in position to block your shot from that area.</b> He always moves in a predictable manner, so make sure you don't shoot when he's headed towards the bottom of the net.
<br><br>Finally, you can score from this spot with any of the Yooyus that goes straight. Just go to this spot and shoot upwards (remember to watch the goalie's position!), and it'll go right into the goal behind his/her back.</p>
<br><br><font size="5"><b>The Faerie Yooyu</b></font><br><br><p>
The Faerie Yooyu requires the strangest strategy to score with consistently due to its shooting arc, which is the reason why it gets its own section. Note that you can do this strategy with any of the Yooyus that you can shoot straight, but this takes a much longer time to actually get a goal and the AI is more likely to steal the Yooyu from you due to the path you take.
<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SaSfA4x.png"><br><br>
Unlike with every other Yooyu, you want to tackle the AI up, due to the path you need to take. Position yourself like this, then tackle upwards.
<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/czmUIjI.png"><br><br>After tackling the AI, follow this path. What you do by taking this path is you lure the goalie to the top-right corner of the goalie's box. As you make your way down, you'll actually be slightly faster than the goalie, letting you just shoot it right in. By being that close to the goal, the Faerie Yooyu does not have enough space to start curving and it'll just go straight in.
<br><br><br><br><font size="5"><b>Random Notes</b></font>
<br><br>
- Try to save your power ups by avoiding them if possible, only grabbing them when they're starting to de-spawn.
<br>- The Giant power up basically powers up your shot to the point where every Yooyu moves at 2-3x the Fire Yooyu's speed and distance. Use this to your advantage by using Hawkshanks' and Nitri's lines. Your shots become so strong in fact, you can actually score with relative ease with your goalie by standing on the lines.
<br>- If the AI steals the Yooyu from you, don't just rush in and try to steal it back immediately. Give the AI some time with the Yooyu, then steal it from them. Also try to tackle them in a direction that leads you away from the crowd of players.
<br>- When you're feeling pressured by the AI, start charging up a shot while moving away from the opposing team, then shoot the Yooyu in the opposite direction you were moving. Let the AI grab the Yooyu, tackle them to steal it, then work your way towards the goal from there.</p>
