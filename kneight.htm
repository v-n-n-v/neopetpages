<h1>Breaking into UCs, a Guide</h1>
<center><a href="/~Maldrycent">EN ESPAÃ‘OL</a></center>

<p>Welcome to my guide on breaking into UC trading! I often see boards asking for tips on how to get into UC trading, and there is just so many ways to go about this and it is such a frequent question that I thought a petpage guide would help a lot! A lot of this information will be based on my own experiences so please keep that in mind, but I hope it helps you! Breaking into UC trading will require a lot of patience and luck. I wish you the best in achieving your goals!

</p><p><b>PLEASE REMEMBER!!!</b> I understand that working towards your goal can be disheartening at times. Please take care of yourself! It is okay to take a step back and take a break. Your goals are valid, but it is still important to put your health and happiness first.

<p></p><hr><h1>Names</h1>
<p>A lot of people break into UCs with trading names. Names are tricky because they are so subjective. If you're not sure how people like your name, you can always ask on the boards what they would personally trade for it to get an idea! Here I will break down different types of names to hopefully help you out.

</p><p><b>Common RW/RN</b>: These are common real words or real names, usually in the English language. Many people enjoy common rw/rn, but what they value these names can be very subjective and depends on the word/name. It helps a lot if the name has a lot of character potential!

</p><p><b>Fandom RW/RN</b>: These are words and names that come from certain media such as tv shows, movies, video games, etc. For fans, they can be valued very high! It all depends on how popular the fandom is and the word/name in particular.

</p><p><b>CVCV/VCVC 4ls</b>: These are four lettered names that follow a consonant / vowel / consonant / vowel pattern (i.e. Tibu) or a vowel / consonant / vowel / consonant pattern (i.e. Erub). Depending on the arrangements, they can trade relatively well.

</p><p><b>3l/2l/1l</b>: Names that are 3 letters long that are nice and pronouncable can trade very well! As well as names that are 2 letters and pronouncable. Names that are 1 letter are so rare that they're probably valued very high.

</p><p><b>Obscure RW/RN</b>: These are less common real words and names in the English language or just words in other languages. They can be difficult to trade unless you find just the right person, and when you do they are often traded for low tiered UCs.

</p><p><b>Pronounceable 4ls</b>: These can be nice depending on the arrangement, and are subjective whether they click with others. They can be difficult to trade unless you find just the right person, and when you do they are often traded for low tiered UCs.

</p><p><b>Misspells</b>: A misspell is a word that is slightly spelled differently but they are pronounced the same way (i.e. wulf is a misspell of wolf). They are also very subjective, but they may go for low tiered UCs.

</p><p><b>Other names</b>: For those very badly named low tiered UCs, many people don't mind looking for other kinds of names that are simply "feminine", "masculine", "pretty", "compound words", etc.

</p><hr><h1>Other Pets</h1>
<p>Older pets that are very well named can be highly valued! Pets that were born in <b>Year 1</b> can trade for around Tier 5, while pets in <b>Year 2</b> can trade for low tiered UCs. You can check what year your pet was born in on their lookup!

</p><p></p><hr><h1>Battledome Training</h1>
Battledome trading is, in my opinion, the most consistent way of giving a pet value, as it isn't reliant on subjectiveness. Your pet's value goes up for every stat it gains. However, the catch is that it is expensive and takes a very long time. People often pair training a pet with nice names mentioned above, but usually people either value the pet based on the stats or the name and not combined (but please, if anyone has different experience let me know!)

<p>There are many guides about training already, but I can go through some main tips:

</p><p>Training at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/academy.phtml">Swashbuckling Academy</a> is cheaper, but takes longer while training at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/training.phtml">Mystery Island Training School</a> is more expensive, but the training time is shorter.

</p><p>There is a method of training that is popular where you train evenly up to level 100. Then you train health up to 300, and after that you train only levels up to level 250. Once you reach level 250 you can train at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/fight_training.phtml?type=courses">Secret Ninja Training School</a>. This method is done by many because it is considered faster and cheaper. Many people looking for BD pets for their UCs also are more likely to consider pets that have 250+ levels!

</p><p>Some abbreviations used with battledome pets are:

</p><p><b>HSD</b> means <b>health, strength, and defense</b>. This is when you add up all the stats of health, strength, and defense. <i>Notice that movement is not included!!</i>. As of now, movement doesn't do anything in the battledome, and people do not take movement into account with BD pet values. Thus, you can skip training movement at all.

</p><p>Also to note is that strength and defense are capped at 750, so you should not need to train them past 750, but you can continue training health and add value that way.

</p><p><b>e/t</b> means <b>even and trainable</b>. <b>Even</b> means that the pet's stats are pretty equal (i.e. Strength = 100, Health = 100, Defense = 100), while <b>trainable</b> means that the level isn't too low to train the pet.

</p><p>You can use <a href="/~Trelm">Trelm</a> to see the BD stats to UC values.
</p>
<hr><h1>Customs</h1>
For the converteds above, it helps to add a custom to the pet you are trading. This means you will be willing to change the species/color of the pet to trade by buying potions and brushes with neopoints, using a Faerie Fountain Quest to change the color, or a Premium Perk.

<p></p><hr><h1>General Trading Tips</h1>
If your pets aren't trading for UCs, you may have to trade them with other converteds before you can break into UCs, and that's okay! It is helpful to have multiple trading fodder to increase your chances of finding a good trade. A good place to trade around converteds are <b>Pet Auction Houses</b>. Rules can be found <a href="/~cheesy">here</a>. The main idea is that people list their pets to be bid on, and they must choose someone to trade with by the end of the auction!

<p><b>UC Shuffles</b>: UC Shuffles are a great way to break into UCs! Rules and more information to the shuffles can be found <a href="//www.neopets.com/~medicare">here</a>. For the basic gist of it, it's a board where people list UC pets to be bidded on. The key here is when they list under "quiggle" <img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/quiggle.gif"> they are accepting converted offers. The best shuffles to enter are <b>No Pass</b> shuffles because listers have to choose an offer and trade. As someone who has broken into UCs through these shuffles, I believe they really increase your chances of getting into UCs! It still doesn't hurt to try an offer on <b>Pass Shuffles</b>. You don't know if they may click with your offer c:

</p><p></p><hr><h1>Applying for a UC</h1>
When a UC goes up for adoption, this can be a good opportunity to break into UC trading, or even directly adopt one of your goals! Here are some general tips for applying for UCs. A more thorough guide can be found <a href="/~adopter">here</a>!

<p><b>Be reasonable.</b> Apply for UCs that will probably be able to trade for your goal. This is not a rule, but many people who adopt UCs will be looking for applicants with goals they can achieve pretty quickly with their pet.

</p><p><b>Be honest!</b> Tell the owner why you want their pet. If you want to retrade, what do you plan on retrading them for? If you made them a character, tell them about this character. If you do customization, then show off some customization ideas! The person adopting out will probably be looking through your account(s) and see if are consistent with what you say with your other pets.

</p><p><b>Follow the rules!!</b> Make sure you read the rules carefully and follow them!

</p><p><b>The person adopting out the UC has the final say</b>. Things happen, and UC adoptions can get very time consuming and tiring for the person adopting out. The process may become lengthened or postponed. Please do not pester or nag the owner! You do not know what they are going through, and perhaps adopting out a UC is not in their highest priority right now. I understand that you may put a lot of work into an application, but nothing is certain when applying for pets and you're never entitled to the pet just for applying. Also, do not pester the new chosen owner if it was not you. Be mindful, be patient, and be empathetic.

</p><p></p><hr><h1>Project Pages</h1>
Project pages are very similar to an application. They can consist of most of what an application does such as why you want the pet and your plans. Simply, you are putting effort into a pet you plan to own in the future, whether it be from applying or trading for them. Some owners who want to adopt their UC out in a quick fashion and who wants to know if people definitely want that particular UC, they may choose to instead adopt out to someone who has a project page for their UC already. <a href="/~eggso">Eggso</a> is a page full of project pages that people may go to look to adopt out their UCs, so it is a great place to list your project page!

<p></p><hr><h1>Conclusions</h1>
That is it for now! I hope this guide is comprehensive and helps you out. I am always looking for advice and for your experience if you broke into UC trading and how you went about it to update and add to this petpage!
