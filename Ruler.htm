					<h1>Catz1 Mobile-Friendly Beta Testing</h1>
					
					
					<ul class="list"><li><div id="specs">Hey TNT, I'm catz1. I'm a long-time player and love Neopets! I'm very excited to be able to test the mobile-friendly beta launch. I was a software tester for a mobile app and desktop software for many years, so applying those skil.ls to something I love is really awesome! 
<br><br>
My specs are as follows: 
<br><br><strong>Android Phone</strong>: LG V60 ThinQ 5G. Running Android 12. Display size is 6.8 inches at 1080x2460 resolution. 395 ppi. Browser is Kiwi Browser 101.0.4951.48 (as of July 19, 2022. Previously, it was Samsung Internet, v12.1.2.5 with "Webpage text size" (Settings - Appearance) set to 110%.)
<br><br><strong>iPhone</strong>: iPhone 7 Plus. Latest version of Safari. Running iOS 13.4.1. Display size is 5.5 inches at a 16:9 ratio with ~441ppi density. 1080x1920 resolution.
<br><br><strong>Laptop</strong>: 17.3in, Core i7, Dell Precision M6800. Running Windows 10. Browser is Vivaldi 5.3.2679.61. (Vivaldi is Chromium-based.) Additional browser testing done with Firefox 76.0.1.
<br><br><strong>Mobile screenreader</strong>: Android TalkBack.
<br><strong>Desktop screenreader</strong>: NVDA 2020.1. 
<br><br>
Let's get started!</div>
					</li></ul><br><div id="updates"><h2><b>Updates</b></h2></div>
<p><strong>August 24, 2023</strong></p>
<p>1. On the new Settings page, your grey font fails accessibility contrast standards. Tools to check this are FREE. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ra7WPGk.png" title="Screenshot of AIM's color contrast checker showing the failed contrast of 2.88."></center>
<p>2. Making dropdowns grey typically has a heuristic meaning of "can't edit." These dropdowns should match the theming of existing dropdowns across the site, where the text inside the dropdown is dark.
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Rg5jEga.png" title="Screenshot of dropdown on Settings page versus a dropdown in a mystery capsule."></center>
<p>3. The buttom theming for the "Essentials" capsule doesn't match existing theming for capsules where you can choose your category. It doesn't match any existing Neopets styling, actually.
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ng0w2VN.png" title="Screenshot of Essentials capsule vs a Strawberry Rerelease capsule."></center>

<p><strong>November 15, 2022</strong></p>
<p>1. The Haunted Woods mobile beta theme isn't automatically applied on Halloween, but the Birthday mobile beta theme is applied on November 15th. Haunted Woods theme may need fixing.
<br><br></p><p><strong>July 19, 2022</strong></p>
<p>Prettied up this page a little and added an "Events" section for things like Festival of Neggs, Neopies, etc. 
<br><br>
1. Mobile-only - Altador Cup - When viewing Team Player details, the expanded menus get stuck over each other, and you can't close them (or view all details). 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vYViAU9.png" title="Altador Cup Team Details Screenshot"></center>
<br><br><p>2. I got a random event upon logging in, but the format was really strange.
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Tajuxo8.png" title="RE Screenshot"></center>
<br><br><p>3. NC Collector's Album: His name isn't Chadle, it's Chadley. Also, why don't the buttons here use the established site styling (green and blue rounded buttons with gradients)? 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fe8FnFj.png" title="NC Collector Album Screenshot"></center>
<br><br><p>4. When you're using the Grey Day beta theme, the Money Tree donation modal header can't be read. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Cnuk0qt.png" title="Money Tree Screenshot"></center>
<br><br><p>5. Mobile only - When signing in, can you PLEASE collapse this bit above the keyboard? I always end up tapping that button instead of the button below the PW field, and the one above the keyboard refreshes the page instead of signing you in, thus removing your UN and PW that you just entered. (Side note, why are "Lo//gin" and "L//og In" spelled two different ways?) 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5fMNjdY.png" title="Sign In Screenshot"></center>
<br><br><div id="pets"><h2><b>My Pets</b></h2>		
<p>1. Nothing but the arrow to switch pets is selectable with TalkBack on. The site needs to work for screenreader users.
<br><br>
2. Arrow button to scroll pets is labeled "button." Consider using help text here to indicate it will scroll you to the next pet.
<br><br>
3. There's no indication or focus change when you tap the arrow. You should have some sort of signal for screenreader users that the pet changed, even if that signal is putting focus on the pet name after switching. (Consider rearranging the UI to put pet names at the TOP of windows in order to give more context to both screenreader and non-screenreader users. The visual hierarchy makes more sense, too.)<br><br>
4. Reads out "Welcome to Neopets Web View" when opened; shouldn't read "web view." 
<br><br>
5. Can't navigate with keyboard, even when screenreader isn't on.
<br><br>
6. No way to disable animations for the decorative icons in top toolbar of My Pets and sidebar (WCAG 2.3.3, since they're non-essential animations).
<br><br>
7. Pet icon in the top left should have an arrow indicating there's more content available if you tap it - right now, it doesn't look actionable.
<br><br>
8. The hill background for my pets is really cute! But on a desktop, I have lots of room. What if they were spread out on the hill, and then only scooted into a scrollable view when I zoomed in far enough? 
<br><br>
9. Show me the backgrounds for my pets... that's part of a customisation just like the pet's clothes are. If you don't want to enable it for everyone, make it a user-level setting to Show/Hide.
<br><br>
10. Once I have clicked on the beta Kacheek/event button, make him smaller, collapse him, or make him or go away. He's informational and I don't need to see him all the time. Especially when I zoom in and the site reflows, he gets REALLY BIG and covers some of my pets.
<br><br>
11. The hierarchy of Pet Care could be improved by putting "Details" as the title of the popup, the pet name within the popup/close to the stat table, and a link to view the lookup elsewhere in the popup (especially since viewing the lookup and the homepage are often equally accessed from the current non-beta equivalent of this functionality). Both screenreader and non-screenreader users would benefit from something like this: 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/heB86uy.png?1=" title="New Pet Details Screenshot"></center>
<br><br><p>12. The icons for stats are not intuitive - they need to have tooltips or labels that indicate what they are. Screenreader users will also benefit from this. 
<br><br>
13. Make the stat table and the blank square use the full width of the popover or align them with the Feed/Groom/etc. buttons.
<br><br>
14. Several of the images in the popover are off-center (Dress Up, Read, Groom, Take Photo).
<br><br>
15. In Pet Care, if I click on a button that will "take me out of the mobile-friendly Neopia" (e.g. Equip), clicking X exits me entirely from the popover, not just dismissing the warning, thus adding a click. 
<br><br>
16. Clicking the NPs button, NC button, or any button in the Bell Alert menu doesn't give me the warning for leaving the mobile-friendly site.
<br><br>
17. Mobile-only: are the tap targets for user profile and pet in the sidebar large enough? 44x44px or 48x48dp as noted in the Google Material guidelines and Apple HIG?
<br><br>
18. The tap target for the Neopian calendar is way too small and doesn't look actionable - it looks like the other decorative icons next to "My Pets" etc.
<br><br>
19. I can't see my petpetpets (P3s) anywhere easily. 
<br><br>
20. Mobile-only - can't pinch to zoom.
<br><br>
21. Mobile-only: In the bottom bar, the green "1" badge only reads "One" when TalkBack is on, giving no indication of what "1" means. Consider using accessibilityHint to indicate what the "1" means. 
<br><br>
22. <strong>EDIT 9/16/2020:</strong> Can confirm that the pet image is expanded by default in the sidebar for 17-inch laptops and NOT expanded by default on the form factor directly below that, 15-inch. If this is intentional, it makes no sense.
<br><br>
23. Sidebar: Kind of distracting to have "AM/PM NST" move slightly with each second. Is there a way that that string could have a fixed position?
<br><br>
24. In landscape, Pet Care is cut off in many different ways. It's hard to see anything: 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/E5q88C1.png" title="Pet details in popover - landscape"></center>
<br><br><p>25. In landscape, I can't scroll fully down to all my bookmarks - the menu is only the length of the screen and I can't scroll farther. Most notable in the Grundo Plushie activity.
<br><br>
26. If you are planning on implementing submenus in the layout, please ensure the nav elements include aria-labels so that screenreader users can select more than just the top menu! *pray hands emoji*
<br><br>
27. If you are scrolled to a certain pet, after you use an item on them, the refresh brings you back to the beginning of your pet list. It should stay on the pet I had selected.
<br><br>
28. Desktop-only: Weird bug after grooming - pets will flash up at a lARGE size before resizing. Just a brief image.  
<br><br>
29. Playing with pets or reading them a book in Pet Care shows "Toys: [x]" or "Books: [x]" while Grooming, Feeding, etc. show "Grooming items LEFT: [x]." The wording should be consistent between all of them, regardless of whether the items are consumable or not. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kqlQ3Ai.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>30. Mobile-only: With large text on, "Community" overlaps with the other words in the toolbar. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IUYSZ9R.png" title="Overlap screenshot"></center>
<br><br><p>31. Desktop-only: When zooming in, the Usul and Techo that appear in the bottom bar are very low-res next to the (really clean!!) new assets for Premium, Shops, etc.
<br><br>
32. The font in the item description does not pass contrast standards.
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/krtG1bu.png?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><br><br><p>37. iPhone only: In landscape, the warning for less mobile-friendly Neopian lands gets cut off oddly. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gA90Uu4.jpg?1=" title="Screenshot"></center>
<br><br><p>33. Text on the NC/NP toolbar looks weirdly bold - the ones look a bit like sevens. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/c3CpNfS.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>34. Vivaldi, mobile (iOS and Android) ONLY - There's no scrollbar that appears in the Pet Care view when you've expanded their image to the full size. Firefox has one, which is good, because it indicates that there's more content. Not sure if this is Firefox's handling, but it would be nice to have it in all browsers. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/m7LdtEw.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>35. Firefox only: If you've expanded the image of your pet in the Pet Care view, when you click on another pet, the scrollbar will start at the place you'd scrolled to in the view BEFORE. For instance, if I open the popup for Adereil and scroll to the bottom, then close it using the "X" button, when I click on LindyPop, the scrollbar will be at the bottom again.
<br><br></p><center>I made a gif of this issue, but it's really large. It lives at http://i.imgur.com/8gxv5P0.g i f (minus spaces).</center>
<br><br><p>36. iOS only - None of the Neopets interface (sidebar, bottom bar, NC/NP bar) in Safari respects the large text settings. If you visit a certain encyclopedia site in mobile Safari, you'll be able to see that the page content resizes according to large text setting, but on Neo, it doesn't. See in the screenshot, the text in the URL is large (respects large text) but the site isn't.
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aWtPtTI.jpg?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>37. iOS only - With VoiceOver on and the screen scrolled down to see the Pet Name button, VoiceOver can select the NC/NP button (which is, at this point, below the Search/Bell bar) and read it like, "Two thousand four hundred and three." 
<br><br>
So there's two problems here - 1) Text that isn't visible is selectable (because, with VoiceOver, you double tap to select whatever you're focused on - so in this case, you'd be navigated away from this screen), and 2) The number of NC/NP is read with no context as to what the number means, because the NC icon and NP icon are not selectable or readable by VoiceOver. 
<br><br>
Hard to see, but in the screenshot here, you can see that the NC button is selected. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ea6rzcP.jpg?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>38. iOS only - With VoiceOver on, if I open the Shop via the link in the toolbar, VoiceOver automatically selects the Community notification when the page loads. So it reads something like, "Web page - character mode - is editing - [Number]." Focus should start at the... hmm, normally I'd say on the Back button, so they can quickly undo an action, but you've got no back button that will take you back to My Pets here - only back to the map. 
<br><br>
39. I see that the max zoom-in is 300% (which satisfies the WCAG criterion!). Is there a way to fail gracefully once a user can't zoom in anymore? Maybe have a popup that appears once that indicates that this is as far as you can zoom in? (Nice to have, not really a dealbreaker.)
<br><br>
40. iOS only - With VoiceOver on, nothing in the top yellow toolbar is selectable: you can't tap it OR swipe to it. <strong>This means you can't open the sidebar.</strong>
<br><br>
41. Clicking on a Neomail alert doesn't clear the notification when it takes you to the Classic site. 
<br><br>
42. For a Neomail alert, the whole card should be tappable, not just the envelope icon. You could perhaps pin the "X" button to the top corner of the card, echoing how you do it for the Closet portion of the Customisation activity on desktop.
<br><br>
43. iOS only - You can scroll the "My Pets" page when the Alerts toolbar is open if you: Open News/Alerts bar, then scroll down in the News tab, then switch to Alerts tab, then switch back to News tab and scroll on the News tab. 
<br></p><center><b>Video lives at i.imgur.com/QOPDBZF dot mp4.</b></center>
<br><br><p>48. On the Pet Details popover, the bottom bar covers the drop shadow of the bottom row of buttons, so it looks a little wonky. 
<br></p><center><b>Video lives at https://i.imgur.com/IegKhdr.m p 4</b> (minus spaces)!</center> 
<br><br><p>44. If I have no bookmarks, I am told to tap the "heart icon." But if I tap Manage Bookmarks, it's called the "Favorite Icon." Should be consistent!
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hzC3Uoc.png?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>45. On the Bookmarks page, tapping the "?" icon doesn't do anything. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Qfk11Jo.png" title="Screenshot"></center>
<br><br><p>46. My Pets - when you scroll down to see your pet's name, then rotate to landscape, you end up with half a page of white space. Does not happen if you don't scroll down first. 
<br><br></p><center><b>Video lives at https://i.imgur.com/lnjUxGN.m p 4 (minus spaces!)</b></center>
<br><br><p>47. I'm in the Altador Constellations theme - should these buttons be styled like the Pet Name buttons (grey) or are you keeping them the semantic colors? 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/o3K0qZp.png" title="Screenshot."></center>


<br><br><br><div id="cr"><h2><b>Create-a-Pet</b></h2>
<p>1. Mobile-only - Most pet names are spelled out when read by TalkBack, resulting in "T-u-s-k-a-n-i-n-n-y" and "O-g-r-i-n" and the like. I'm not sure if there's anything you can do there, though.
<br><br>2. Mobile-only - With TalkBack on, you get a weird "Blue - unchecked, Yellow - unchecked, Red - Unchecked" etc. when swiping through pet color options. 
<br><br>3.  If a pet name is taken, it changes the name to "Name is taken," and when rotated to landscape (mobile), gives an "Undefined" error.
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/OnIMq7o.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>4. There's no error given if you can't create a pet. When you tap the Create button, it just doesn't execute. Ideally a toast or popover should appear here telling you why you can't create the pet - name taken, missing required item, etc.
<br><br>5. On the Stats part, the alignment is weird, and there's no way to know what "S, D, M" or "A, B, C" mean. Additionally... how do I select one?
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3WzMGmk.png" title="Screenshot."></center>


<br><br><br><div id="custom"><h2><b>Customisation</b></h2>
<p>1. Desktop-only: I can't click to apply/remove, I can only drag. <font color="red"><strong>This violates WCAG 2.5.1 regarding path-based gestures.</strong></font>
<br><br>
2. What is the significance behind the first item that appears underneath your pet? Is it the first item alphabetically, first item in the top zone...? 
<br><br>
3. Items aren't arranged in the closet alphabetically. 
<br><br>
4. What is the "Newest First" on the Filters page? Is that newest by release date, newest since you've put in your closet, or something else?
<br><br>
5. Mobile only: With TalkBack on, the large image of our pet just reads "Graphic." Would be great if it could say "Outfit Preview." Or maybe, if possible, "[Pet Name] Outfit Previw." 
<br><br>
6. Mobile only: With TalkBack on, in the pet chooser at the top of the screen, when selecting a pet, it reads "[Pet Name] Graphic." Could it read something like, "Customise [Pet Name]"?
<br><br>
7. Mobile only: None of the UI buttons like Save, Wearing/Closet, or the Help button are labeled, so TalkBack can't read them. 
<br><br>
8. Mobile only: With TalkBack on, if you tap on the big pet image, you can't swipe to navigate. You're stuck. 
<br><br>
9. Mobile only: With TalkBack on, if I let the screen time out and then unlock with an in-screen fingerprint sensor, the page will read the item name that's under my fingerprint. So something like this: "Device unlocked - Neopets Customise your Neopet web view - Sunset Makeup." 
<br><br>
10. Mobile only: With TalkBack on, if you select the Filters button to open that page, none of the forms on this screen are selectable.
<br><br>
11. On the buttons for "NC" and "NP," you could improve usability by adding the words "only" to indicate that you'll only be searching those items. Helpful for screenreader users as well. 
<br><br>
12. Mobile only: With any level of large text on, item names get cut off. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FPkY0KD.png?2=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>13. The error that appears when you select an item that's applied to another pet is very hard to read, since the whole thing is in the Title font. It should say something like this: "Oops! [Pet Name] is already wearing [Item Name]." (If you can't dynamically get the name of the pet, I'd just say "Another pet" instead.) 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5ApojEg.png?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>14. The loading JubJub is very cute :) But the black font is hard to see against the grey of the Shield of Justice behind it, and fails contrast standards. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/m1fpv3G.png?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>15. <font size="2"><strike>By contrast, the popup that appears for item details fails contrast standards. Since it's essential text, it needs to pass.</strike></font> It passes now! The only issue left is that there's too many stylings - I'd remove the bold styling here. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cWh6OIZ.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>16. Not the biggest fan of the red and white frame to indicate that there's more information available. This is really easy to fat finger, and it won't be read in a meaningful way to screenreader users. (Indeed, it isn't read at all - Android just gives you the standard "Double tap to activate.") Consider using accessibilityHint to tell a user what this is going to do, or just showing the item multiple times if multiples exist. 
<br><br>
17. As above, ^^ the amount of items that appear in the purple bubble needs to be given some context as well, probably with using the same code. 
<br><br>
18. Mobile only: Closet items are not selectable with TalkBack on.
<br><br>
19. The icon for Wearing/Closet toggle is not intuitive at all. Consider just having a toggle with the words "Wearing" on it - it wouldn't take up that much more space than what you have.
<br><br></p><p>20. Android only - <font color="red">Customisation just disappears when you rotate to landscape.</font> It loads fine in portrait, but if you flip to landscape, you're faced with a blank screen. This definitely isn't how it used to operate, and it is a WCAG violation to only hae it available in portrait. iOS works fine.
<br><br></p><center><b>Video lives at i.imgur.com/3l4dqdc.m p 4</b> (minus spaces)!
<br><br>There's another video of the actual animation that makes it not load (it sort of slides off to the right of the page when rotated): https://i.imgur.com/KFSZL3V.m p 4 (minus spaces).</center>
<br><br><p>21. In the Customise activity, tapping the "Expand" button and then rotating to landscape leads to some SERIOUSLY bugged layout. I'm talking walls of text in the against a dark grey background, chaos, etc. (Works fine when rotating back to portrait.)
<br></p><center><b>Video lives at https://i.imgur.com/5qMOT72.m p 4</b> (minus spaces)!</center>
<br><br><p>22. Similarly, in the Customise activity, tapping the "Filter" button and then rotating to landscape isn't handled gracefully. (Works fine when rotating back to portrait.)
<br></p><center><b>Video lives at https://i.imgur.com/wyIzXSh.m p 4</b> (minus spaces)!</center>
<br><br><p>23. Customisation still only allows for drag and drop on desktop - why not allow me to just tap once to put it on my pet, tap once to take it off? This way you don't violate the WCAG criteria for path-based gestures (and you're not losing functionality compared to the old version). 
<br><br></p><p>24. The loading jubjub in the Customisation activity can sometimes appear right over the Neopet's name. What if the screen dim was limited to a smaller, darker square and the text made white instead? Or you could use the animated traditional loading spinner that's in the News/Alerts bar (the yellow one) as long as that one is eventually announced to screenreaders? 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/r4yebCg.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>25. Mobile only - in the Filters part of the Customisation activity, in landscape, it's really hard to scroll to the bottom of the page (not the bottom of the filter container), because you have to grab that tiny bit of uncovered page on the side. Could we make this container smaller in landscape? It's less of a problem in portrait because you aren't scrolling as much. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VpRTzv3.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br>26. What if we had the word "Filters" in front of the filters, when they're applied? It's clearer and also makes things easier for screenreader users (otherwise you're just being read "NC Items" with no context). 
<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0i0Ntxd.png" title="Screenshot."></center>

<br><br><br><div id="shop"><h2><b>Shops/Wiz &amp; Search</b></h2>
<p>1. The text overlaps with the haggle box.
<br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CEskDf7.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>2. There should be a period after the word "Inventory." (Might be pre-existing?)
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/u2krH3w.png?2=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>3. Mobile only: Landscape view makes it really hard to haggle in shops. I know you can't control the keyboard behavior, so maybe the haggle box could be in a separate popup? That way, when the keyboard zooms in on the text field, it won't be so small.</p><div id="haggle"></div> 
<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yHXViNk.png?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>4. Should be a period after "Marketplace" (might be pre-existing?).
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VWWdVUS.png?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>5. It's odd that the "Back" arrow for the Shop doesn't take me to the last page I was on (usually My Pets) and instead takes me to the area map. Semantically, it looks like a browser's Back button and I'd expect it to behave as such. Maybe it could just be the words "Back to map" instead of an arrow? Or an arrow with a globe on it?
<br><br>
6. You do need a Back button that will take you back to My Pets, though. A browser button isn't always accessible, especially with a screenreader - usually a screenreader doesn't land on the browser controls first, it lands somewhere on the webpage. That somewhere should be a Back button, so folks can easily "undo" the navigation action they just took if they made it by mistake.
<br><br>
7. iPhone only: Weird screens appearing over each other if you: Go to Money Tree - Rotate to landscape - Tap "My Pets" - quickly rotate to portrait while your pets are loading. Easier to do on a slow connection.</p><div id="weirdscreens"></div>  
<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/thU10AJ.png?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>7a. iOS only - Can get a similar bug if you: Go to Mystery island in portrait - tap on Beach Volleyball - rotate to landscape while it's loading - rotate back to portrait. The top Neopets bar will appear over the Mystery Island map. If your connection is very fast, you probably won't see this. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qZkwpkk.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>8. There are two refresh buttons at the Money Tree ONLY when you are in portrait - I think it would be helpful to have two in any orientation!
<br><br>
9. Mobile-only: If you gently swipe up so that the header "bumps" against the top of the screen, you can get the NC and NP toolbar (which includes the bookmarks icon) to overlay the top portion of any screen. This is very unhelpful, especially in shops and the Customisation activity. 
<br></p><center><b>Video lives at https://i.imgur.com/JTJQG2J. m p 4</b> (minus spaces).</center>
<br><br><p>10. Haggling - what do you think about clearing the text in the input box after you've haggled once? You can see your previous bid in the little bubble boxes above the input box, so I don't think it's necessary to have it there. Most people aren't going to be deleting one number for a new haggle (they'll probably enter two or three), so there wouldn't be too many extra clicks compared to the current workflow.
<br></p><center><b>Video lives at https://i.imgur.com/Z4cCEjs.m p 4</b> (minus spaces!)</center>
<br><br><p>11. In the new Super Shop Wiz, the options are "Containing my phrase" and "Identical to" instead  of "Identical to phrase." The old SSW has matching sentence structures; they should both have "... my/to phrase."
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/I2yDqNz.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>12. The "Containing/Identical" words run out of the container. Maybe just add truncation with "..." there? Or just the word "Containing?"
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DC3xOxV.png" title="source: imgur.com"></center>
<br><br><p>13. I really like the way the SSW moves with the keyboard in mobile! Could we do this for haggling in shops? Just for the entry box, not the whole page.
<br><br></p><p>14. Somehow I can get a toast that just says "Error" when searching in the Shop Wiz. This particular case happened when I typed in "Sausage and pepperoni omelette" into the regular Shop Wiz (operator: Identical). After I searched with a "containing" operator, it seemed to work fine. Regardless of whether this is reproducible, the error message should be more descriptive.
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mspYpUd.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>15. The old Shop Wiz had your original search term AND what term it was matching when you saw your results. I think we should keep this - if you go Back, there's no way to actually see what you searched, because Search is cleared. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TqEtjAV.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>16. For the error message that appears when you try to take NPs from The Money Tree and have too many, "The Money Tree" should be capitalized, as it's capitalized in the button right below. (Might be pre-existing.) 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/AfZlNqZ.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>17. The Search button in the Shop Wiz and SSW isn't selectable via tap or swipe with TalkBack or VoiceOver on.</p>
<br><br><p>18. Regular Shop Wiz - magnifying glass on the search button is off-center.
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bE2Ad1S.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>19. iOS only - you can play a really fun game of ping pong when the Super Shop Wiz is open. (Not sure if there's anything you can do about this though.)
<br><br></p><center><b>Video lives at https://i.imgur.com/Y3tpwf9.m p 4 (minus spaces!)</b></center>
<br><br><p>20. This may be intentional - are you not allowing bookmarks for the regular Shop Wiz? 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KBg5aXD.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>21. Android only: The Shop Wiz and SSW could benefit from some padding before the first character in the price field. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/r21TtzP.png" title="source: imgur.com"></center>
<br><br><p>22. When I search a term that won't be fulfilled - like "1/3" with the operator "identical to" - the Shop Wizard shows me a "..." in place of the term on the results screen. Could we actually see the term here, like in the old Shop Wiz? 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jUYdMjD.png?1=" title="Screenshot"></center>
<br><br><p>23. Shop Wiz: The Resubmit button is at the bottom, meaning if I want to resubmit my search on mobile, I have to scroll down, tap it, then scroll back up to the top of the table. Consider putting "Resubmit" and "New Search" at the top of the Shop Wizard page for ease of use (it's frustrating to have to scroll a lot to complete one task). (And then do it multiple times because the price isn't low enough.) 
<br><br>11. Search: Why are these buttons different colors? I'd imagine they should both be blue or green, since they both take you to a different page. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6ptSjcK.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>12. Search: When I tap the "Shop Wizard" link after clicking on an item, could we pre-fill the name on the next page? Otherwise it's just a link to the Shop Wizard, which already appears in the top bar, if I'm a Premium Member.
<br><br>13. Mobile-only: When the phone is in landscape orientation, could we show the results in a grid? Scrolling line by line is a bit troublesome! 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/rPFSlwr.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>14. In shops, why is the X button on the bottom left? There's an established convention of the modal windows having the X on the top right, and shops are breaking this convention. If it's for easy backing out, I don't see how that's... very helpful, given that you can just click anywhere outside of the modal to dismiss it. The X should be on the top right. (This is also an issue for Pet Details.)
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fnPLA1Q.png" title="Screenshot."></center>

<br><br><br><div id="boards"><h2><b>Neoboards</b></h2></div>
<p>1. iOS only - When typing in a text box on iOS, Safari zooms in so that you can more easily see what you're typing. This action, however, cuts off the Submit button, so users have to scroll in order to submit a post. I know you can't control iOS behavior, so what about putting the submit button on the bottom, or the left? Just something to think about. Left would probably be weird if all of your Send/Accept actions across site are on the right, though.
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bcfnLV7.png?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>2. When you hop into a forum / topic list, the only available link to go back is "Neoboards," but this scrolls you all the way to the top of the subforum list if you tap it, instead of going back to the category you were viewing. What if you also included a link to the subgroup? So like, "Neoboards - Feedback" if you're on the HC.  
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/eVDW8ZQ.png" title="Screenshot"></center>
<br><br><p>3. Mobile only (both iOS and Android) - when rotating from portrait to landscape, username links become grey instead of the semantic blue. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HAPz6Wj.png?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>4. One of the boards on the forum made me remember another WCAG criterion: boards that I created shouldn't be differentiated ONLY by bolded text or other styling. There should be an icon or something! This is laid out in WCAG 1.3.3 - Sensory Characteristics.
<br><br>5. When a screenreader is on, the numbers for going to board pages are read without context, just "One" or "Two." This presents problems because the Community green alert button ALSO just reads a number. Screenreader users would be super confused!
<br><br>
6. Mobile only: When you open a Neoboard topic with a screenreader on, the focus starts on the number for Community Alert. Should start at a back button!
<br><br>
7. In the "header" of a post (where a user's pet image and avatar are), pet images and avatars read something like "pet lookup phtml link image" with VoiceOver on. Android Talkback reads "link." Ideally, they should give more context about where the link would take a user when tapped!
<br><br>
8. When reading the emoticons in the "Reply" box, VoiceOver reads "topic phtml" for all of them, and Talkback reads "Link." Ideally they'd say the names of the emoticons.
<br><br>
9. Android only - when selecting a forum to view and Talkback is on, the page will read "Neopets Neoboard webview out of list." I'm not sure this is something that you can control, though - it might be Android's default handling.
<br><br>
10. Instead of having "Create a topic" at the top and bottom of the page, what if mobile had a floating action button instead? Just something to think about.
<br><br>
11. When creating a Neoboard topic, the title box should expand as I type. It's also very difficult to use in landscape, though this is the same problem as we see <a href="#haggle">in the Shop when haggling.</a>
<br><br>
12. Some titles are cut off by the pet picture - seems to be things like Ls and exclamation points. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ERwwHeC.png?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>13. For some reason, topics that I create use a whole line for the Author/Replies count/Last Reply line, but topics where I am NOT the author do not. <font size="2">EDIT: I think this is actually due to the length of usernames - text wrapping must go funky.</font>
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FsINsOc.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>14. Mobile only: when VoiceOver or Talkback is on, the "?" icon in the Neoboards topic list isn't able to be swiped to. 
<br><br></p><p>15. Neoboards FAQ that appears when you tap the ? icon - I'd make this bolded with a Strong tag so that it's semantic and can be read by screenreaders. Bolding it would also help indicate its importance in more than just color, which fulfills WCAG 1.4.1. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MedP8Du.png" title="Screenshot."></center>

<br><br><br><div id="worldmaps"><h2><b>World &amp; Maps</b></h2></div>
<p><strong>Mystery Island</strong></p>
<p>1. The text for Mystery Island should be above the map in order to provide context for screenreader users. <br><br></p><p>2. I really like how the Cooking Pot shows only a bit of text when in portrait and all of the text in landscape. I like that a LOT! I'd advise maybe putting the bit about "correct items" in the portrait view though, just so folks using it in that orientation have all the info they need.
<br><br></p><p></p><p>3. As others noted, the Mystery Island map is too large for the screen, and the text is aligned very closely to the left side of the screen. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/V9THzgi.png" title="Screenshot."></center></div>
<br><br><p>4. This may just be a bug for me, I'm not sure. But whenever I go to the Brightvale map, I always get the leftover text from the HTML5 conversion event, and it does not play nicely with the table of links. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ElHhOxq.png" title="source: imgur.com"></center>
<br><br><p>5. Krawk Island map: large space between world description and beginning of link table. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8cYPPCl.png" title="source: imgur.com"></center>
<br><br><p>6. The Wheel of Misfortune was going to zap one of my items, but it told me I didn't have any. But... I do? This has been noted on Jellyneo as being bugged since Inventories were updated. 
<br><br></p><p>7. The Wheel of Extravagance should come with some flavor text like "You have been awarded [item]." Right now it just shows you the item name, which means for screenreader users, they'd just hear "Five zero comma zero zero zero" out of context.
<br><br></p><p>8. Why on some quest pages do we have a box that has the character speaking, and on some quest pages, they just speak? 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fzWvdwR.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>9. Typo: Kitchen Quest. Missing period on the last line after "special."
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/O7hmwB7.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>10. Typo: Snow Faerie. "Its" should be "it's."
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kOJwfpn.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>11. Typo: Jhudora. "Ill" should be "I'll."
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2Ws6DYr.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>12. Mobile: On the Community Central page, if you answer the question incorrectly, the answer flows out of the box. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qdSvcr6.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>13. Mobile-only: As best I can gauge, the first or second swipes on the Community Central page won't load after you scroll to them. For instance, when you load the page, swiping on the "Daily Puzzle" element will not work the first 1-2 times. After that, it does! Until you scroll all the way down the page... then back up again, after you've swiped 1-2 times on the Partner Sites element. This video might explain it better? 
<br><br></p><center><b>Video lives at https://i.imgur.com/SAu8ZbN.m p 4 (minus spaces).</b></center>
<br><br><p>14. For all wheels, they begin to spin when you touch the image, not when you tap. (Key down vs key up, basically.) This is really awkward, and may lead to users spinning wheels and NPs they didn't intend to. 
<br><br></p><p>15. The "X" button when you receive your wheel prizes isn't selectable by a screenreader, so a user who's using TalkBack, Voiceover, etc. would have to exit the page entirely to clear the wheel and see the timeout message. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uxN0xC7.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>16. Mobile only: In the original version of the activity, both the Grumpy King and the Wise King have flavor text above their pictures, then a few more paragraphs below. In the mobile version, the longer paragraphs are under the "?" button. Now, the Wise King keeps that little blurb of the flavor text on the mobile view, and the longer version is included in the "?" button. But the Grumpy King does not have that little blurb in the new version, and all of his flavor text is in the "?" button. They should match! (Not only for aesthetic reasons, but also because it gives context to screenreader users for what activity they're in.)
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7v7y9Vm.png?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>17. Neopia Central, Neopian Bazaar, and Neopian Plaza are missing the flavor text that's present in the old Flash version of the activity. This seems to be an error rather than a redesign, since Happy Valley/Ice Caves have their text added. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/T2kKx5l.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>18. Weird discrepancy in spacing between map and links in Terror Mountain. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/r2K8nOU.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>19. Mobile only: Wise King and Grumpy King both have buttons, but the CSS on the Wise King's is weirdly constrained and makes the button look chonky. Since there's a lot of text on the button, could it use the whole width of the screen? 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VNEdj6E.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>20. Underwater Chef page seems to be broken - I think it's supposed to be like Edna's, but it's just showing as Times New Roman: 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XNCYwjB.png" title="Screenshot." width="1000"></center>
<br><br><p>21. As a note, the Edna boxes are very very hard to read? Why do we have three boxes? I've detailed this a bit below in the World section as well, for Jhudora and Illusen. It makes more sense to have two. Or zero, since we know that Edna is the one talking, and don't need three conversation bubbles if there's no other character onscreen_   
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wg39tlF.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>22. Anchor Management seems to have its font and alignment all wonky - it's Times New Roman instead of the new sitewide text font. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TTH7dg2.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>23. When the Tombola is closed, it also has the font issue that Anchor Management has - the text is in Times New Roman instead of the normal font.
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EHPYsMQ.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>24. In Grave Danger, not everything aligns properly. Text should all be centered together.
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/De6Kobs.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>25. On the beta Neopian Post Office, there's a missing space between the two senteces of the Shopkeeper's greeting. (May be pre-existing.) 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SzQclTQ.png" title="Screenshot."></center>

<br><br><br><div id="inv"><h2><b>Inventory</b></h2>		
<p>1. The "Total [X]/50" item count makes it seem like I've selected 11 out of 50 items in my inventory. What if it said "Total: [X] Items" then had a Help icon that gave us the "The maximum amount of items you should have in your inventory at one time is 50" message when tapped?
<br><br></p><p>2. Items stack now, cool! When tapping on a stacked item, what if there was a function in the modal that allowed us to choose the quantity, so I could put ALL One Dubloon Coins in my shop at once? 
<br><br></p><p>3. With TalkBack on, selecting the image of the item in the inventory reads the description of the item.
<br><br></p><p>4. The tabs for the inventory cannot be selected or swiped to when TalkBack is on, and neither can the NP/NC toggle or the Alphabetical Order/Recent toggle. 
<br><br></p><p>5. Mostly noticed this because I came to the Inventory from the News alert bar, but the loading spinner for the News is a yellow progress circle, while the inventory and Customisation have a static image of a Cloud JubJub. I like the JubJub, but I wish he could move a little to indicate he's not frozen? Or just replace him with the yellow progress circle, though I'd be sad to see him go. 
<br><br></p><p>6. Does the Inventory not theme to our current theme? It looks like the top row of the modal does (after I tap on an item), but the buttons are still the yellow that I as.sociate with the basic theme, not the grey of the Altador Constellations theme (when in the AC theme). EDIT: This is not limited to the Inventory - I think it's every modal, so it might be intentional. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JDbVmue.png" title="source: imgur.com"></center>
<br><br><p>7. A star to indicate all items makes me think of favorited items, instead. What if it was a little house icon, or a money bag?
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NfXxUfd.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>8. Mobile only: The link anchors for Quickstock and Item Transfer seem to be weirdly at the top of the page when VoiceOver is on. If you swipe to them, the focus moves to the top left of the page but reads out the names. If you continue swiping, it goes down to Total Inventory as if it hadn't moved out of place at all. 
<br><br></p>
<center><b>Video lives at https://i.imgur.com/cYYmo0M.m p 4 (minus spaces!)</b></center>
<br><br><p>9. The tabbed filters in the Inventory present some issues. As previously noted, there's a bar below the tabs indicating you can swipe to more. The user is not, however, allowed to tap an arrow to get there, which inteferes with <a href="/">WCAG 2.5.1</a> regarding path-based gestures. For everything I can do with a swipe or a click-and-drag, I should be able to do with a tap. So what if instead of tabs it was a dropdown list of categories? 
<br><br></p><p>10. We only get birthday cupcakes once a year, so I don't know if this issue will happen in future or previous NC birthday cupcake items, but there's a lot of issues in the result confirmation message. Obviously, the message is different each year - so I'm betting that the duplicate "Kolirel says" text is the result of incorrect flavor text and the hardcoded "[pet name] says" text that appears in a consumable - but the rest of the text is riddled with errors as well. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8QMrNfo.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>11. Shenanigift invite packs give you two buttons after activating them in your inventory.
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qTa4t0D.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>12. I've mentioned this tangentially before, but NC items sent with gift boxes in the new Inventory always show with a blank alert message, instead of the recipient. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/AS9xzL1.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>13. In the Premium Portal, which I mistakenly opened (I usually avoid it at all costs), the featured game was "Hannah Adventure." The full name of the game is not "Hannah Adventure," and I was on my PC - would it be possible to use the full name of the game here, since there's the screen real estate available?
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/W2oOCpN.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>14. When unlocking a Keyquest token from the NC Mall, the buttons in the modal window are unresponsive when clicked. You cannot close using "Close and Refresh," or go to your Collector's Case. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jCG2sdg.gif" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>15. Sometimes, the modal window takes a moment to close. When this happens, a message appears telling you to either wait or close it. This message is missing an apostrophe in the word "doesn't" and a period at the end of the sentence. (May be pre-existing.) 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CX2fw93.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>16. The message that appears in the modal when equipping a petpet has weird line breaks, with the apostrophes on a new line each. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kr8lsGR.png"></center>




<br><br><br><div id="misc"><h2><b>Miscellaneous Issues</b></h2>
<p>1. Typo in the Money Tree - when you successfully get an item, "thank" should read "than." 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/g85NfAG.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>2. There's weird formatting in the Soup Kitchen! 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/OLflBc8.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><font size="2">Note: If you're not seeing these formatting issues, please increase your system font size and turn on the setting in Firefox for "Use system font size." </font>
<br><br><p>3. On a side where I'd blocked Trudy's - should be a period at the end of "Click here to reactivate."
<br><br></p><center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/H1fqG3R.png?1=" title="Screenshot"></center>
<br><br><p>4. In the Altador Constellations theme, the Pet Details button does not match the theming of the pet name button.
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dbjI8Xi.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>5. The X and Okay buttons in the "Less Mobile-Friendly" popup aren't selectable with Talkback/VoiceOver on; additionally, the "Hold On" isn't announced when appearing.</p>
<br><br><p>6. iOS only - scrolling all the way down the page in Safari makes either of the sidebars - the Alerts/News bar or the left sidebar - have a weird animation when it reappears over the Safari bottom bar. Easier seen, I think. 
<br><br></p><center><b>Video lives at https://i.imgur.com/WxmpxMx.m p 4 (minus spaces!)</b></center>
<br><br><p>7. Extra line in the instructions on the Bookmark icon when I have no Bookmarks.
</p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FjtSWLs.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>8. Mobile only - I know you have to have the footer for Lawyerbot reasons, but it looks really awkward the way it is now - kind of hidden behind the bottom nav bar. Would Lawyerbot be appeased if you moved that information to a trademark icon that could be tapped instead? Or stuck it in the sidebar? Right now it's half-hidden and is hard to read - it looks buggy.
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KrCBUM7.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>9. I noticed that the icons for the "You have received a gift!" NC notifications do not show up! (This notification appears to the recipient when you sent them a Neocash item in a gift box.)
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JJio1eI.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>10. When in landscape, the Bookmarks dropdown (and now the NC navigation dropdown) will not fully scroll to the end of the dropdown. This means I can't access the last link of either dropdown, and renders the Bookmark feature useless in landscape. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wRyCjpk.png" title="source: imgur.com"></center>
<br><br><p>11. Haunted Woods theme: The text in the News/Alert sidebar is too dark for the purple of the background, and fails <a href="/">WCAG 1.4.3</a> for color contrast (should be at least 4:5:1, but is only 2.43:1 right now). 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/PK4GXmx.png" title="Screenshot"></center>
<br><br><p>12. I like the colorful social media icons on the Login screen now! Could the ones on the homepage be updated to match? They're currently still white. 
<br><br></p>
<br><br><p>13. Mobile only: The footer with the legal notice moves around on the page each time you scroll, and it is <em>really</em> annoying. Is there any way to fix it in place? Or perhaps put it as a popover in a little "?" icon in the toolbar?
<br><br></p>
<center><b>Video lives at https://i.imgur.com/OkQiNXu.m p 4 (minus spaces!)</b></center>
<br><br><p>14. Pre-existing issue, but: The Space Faerie Scratchcards should be able to be tapped to reveal the prizes, not just 'scratched.' That's the path-based gesture WCAG criterion at work! 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Z8BYI73.png?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>15. The more and more I use Neopets in Firefox, the harder it is to read the Neopoint and Neocash totals in their little bubbles. The Cafeteria font smushes them all together. Is it possible to make it bigger, or use a more neutral text there? For instance, in the screenshot below, the clock is MUCH more legible than the NP/NC totals. It's really hard to see how much I have on hand at any given point, because I have to divert focus onto deciphering the smushed-ness. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/a1krfp4.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>16. Premium Portal - the badge for how many Space Faerie Scratchcards you have isn't read by a screenreader, and additionally would probably give the user no context if it was. When this is implemented, consider adding a label that says something like "Space Faerie Scratchard Amount: 56." when read by a screenreader. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XhknFnb.png" title="source: imgur.com"></center>
<br><br><p>17. There are several pages that don't theme with the theme you currently have: Bank, Inventory, Premium Portal. It makes them feel really out of place. And... chunky? Like they don't feel like part of the site. The Premium Portal and the Bank are pretty terrible theme-wise, with awkward red, blue, and yellow that feel very elementary and childlike with no sense of visual hierarchy. (In the bank, my eye immediately is drawn to any of the other zillion yellow buttons instead of "Collect Interest," and in the Premium Portal, I'm immediately drawn to the "Change Species" perk button.) I don't foresee myself using the Premium Portal at all, because it's hard to look at (I find the Cafeteria text to be hard to read, honestly, we could use less of it), and I don't use any of the features that live there. 
<br><br></p><p>18. What is this page?? It is scary to look at (no color, text not aligned) and doesn't seem to offer any functionality other than clicking into my bookmarks. It would be nice if I could re-sort my bookmarks from here, or even create custom categories for sorting. (And it could use some color!)
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uByhjPo.png?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>19. When I expand the bookmarks dropdown, the bottom of the "View All" button is cut off when scrolled to the bottom. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cvAUqJg.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>20. Winter theme: The text color against the background in the News &amp; Alerts sidebar (and pet sidebar) fails contrast standards. <b>I am begging you to please test the contrast in this sidebar going forward if you ever want anyone to use it.</b>
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Z8BYI73.png?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>21. Valentine's theme: The contrast of text against background in the News sidebar and Pet sidebar fails contrast standards. <b>This seems to be an ongoing issue with the new themes? Contrast can easily be checked with a WebAIM tool that is the first result if you type "color contrast checker" into any search engine.</b>
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/oe7Wkh8.png?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>22. Grey Day theme: The text that appears in the "Alerts" sidebar drastically fails contrast standards. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EPk2jQv.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>23. Sometimes when I'm on the main Neopets homepage, there are certain random events that won't take up the full width of the banner. I've only ever seen this on the beta index page, nowhere else (though that doesn't mean it isn't happening other places!)
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6mauggU.png" title="Screenshot."></center>


<div id="events"><h2><b>Events</b></h2>	
<p>1. Neopies: The title on the main page is in a different font. Seems to be the same CSS stripping issue we see in Anchor Management, Tombola Closed page, etc.
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8cIEW4h.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>2. Neopies: You have to look at this one really closely, but the trademark text overlaps with the blue box on the Neopies page.
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/rZPxOri.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>3. Neopies VIP raffle: lowercase "i" where it should be "I."
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/slW6Ljc.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>4. Negg Fest: On each negg location page, Kari would have a lot of missing punctuation right before her dialogue. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uanTMRi.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>5. Negg Fest: When you choose a negg, there's a question mark missing at the end of the "Go Back" option. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/b5bIkh7.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>6. Negg Fest: In the Quest Log on the main Negg Fest page, why are some of the Rewatch buttons purple, but some are grey? (Additionally, what is the semantic meaning of the purple button? Are they for actions that aren't Yes/No?)
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Wrj1nhu.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>7. Negg Fest: I don't know if this is a theme issue (Grey Day) or an event page issue, but before Bart's Dip and Dye Neggs stand was open, the message that appeared was dark red text on grey, which fails the 3:4:1 contrast requirement for WCAG.
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nCrFjAF.png" title="Screenshot."></center>


<br><br><br><div id="suggested"><h2><b>Suggested UI Improvements</b></h2></div>
<p><strong>Customisation</strong></p>
<p>I made some changes to the Customisation activity that I think would suit users much better. I'm not sure if this is technically possible, but it allows the user to see the entire customisation instead of the UI of the activity. The original is on the left, and my changes are on the right.
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4HkLCn4.png?1=" title="Customisation Activity Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>What I changed: 
<br><br>
* Removed the UI from covering most of the pet customisation. Now, the Save button is anchored to the top edge of the image, echoing the filter and search buttons in the closet below it. The Wearing/Closet toggle and the Help icon are underneath the image but not in a prominent position, indicating that these aren't going to be common actions taken from this screen. 
<br><br>
* I moved the pet name to the top of the screen. Not only will this allow screenreader users to know exactly which pet they're customising when they first land on the page, it makes more sense in the page hierarchy. I don't think there's an issue regarding vertical space (which I imagine was the reason to put the name under the image). Most phones and tables these days are incredibly tall. 
<br><br>
Additionally, do we really need the black X icon in the card? Or should I be able to just tap it and take it off? 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Brg44rb.png" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p><strong>Neoboards</strong></p>
<strong>Here are a few of my proposed changes for the Neoboard design</strong> (though of course, as usual, a caveat that I'm not a designer, nor am I a developer, so I have no idea if any of these changes are possible). 
<br><br>
1. The list of topics when you drill into a board is awesome. Folks are saying it looks a bit "empty," which I agree, and take to mean that you could utilize horizontal screen real estate a bit better. The original is on the left, and my version is on the right. 
<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/pT90LSr.png?2=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>What I changed:
<br><br>
* Moved hyperlink for latest reply to the bottom right. This reduces the changes of users fat-fingering the link for replies when they mean to view a user's lookup. 
<br><br>
* Moved number of replies to below the author name. This keeps it on the same line as the "Latest replies" option, keeping all reply-related information on one line. 
<br><br><br>
2. <strong>Okay, my next few observations and suggested tweaks depend on removing the "Gender" option from the Neoboards posts.</strong> I think this is info that doesn't make much sense to include in every post BUT could be conveyed by a symbol with a label, if you really wanted, and you could remove the semantic coloring on the text. 
<br><br>
Folks have said that the posts themselves also look empty and that the report button is too big. I propose that you move the timestamp and the report button into the "header" of the message (the grey part) and put them on the same line to indicate that they're part of the same actionable scenario.
<br><br>
You could also consider having the report button be a properly labeled icon. Right now it looks like reporting a message is the main action I'm supposed to take. 
<br><br>
On the left is the original, and on the right are my proposed changes. (Timestamp and button text would have to be bigger to match WCAG standards - my apologies for ant text.)
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0zWSOBG.png?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>What I changed: 
<br><br>
* Moved timestamp into header. 
<br><br>
* Moved report button into header and removed the word "this." (If it's in the header, "this" is implied.) 
<br><br>
* Removed the Gender tag in the header.
<br><br><br>
Okay, next.
<br><br>
3. TNT staff replies are hard to read with that blue background. If possible, I'd like to propose that "The Neopets Team" is moved into the header, and the header itself is blue - not the background of the text post. I took the liberty of mocking this up in landscape and in portrait. The original is on the left, and my changes are on the right and the bottom. Note this also incorporates changes from number 2 above. 
<br><br></p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/i6bZVqa.png?1=" title="Screenshot."></center>
<br><br><p>What I changed: 
<br><br>
* Put "The Neopets Team" at the top of the header. This textually indicates that the header is different than other posts, which is valuable to screenreader users or visually impaired users. 
<br><br>
* Made the header blue instead of grey and changed post background to white. This allows for maximum usability while visually differentiating TNT replies.
<br><br>
Additionally: in a board topic, you've got both of your action buttons (Reply and Submit) as well as the section header ("Reply to Topic") in blue, which makes me think that all three of them are action buttons, since they all have the same color as... the action buttons. What if the section header was differentiated in a different way, or the Reply/Submit buttons were a different color? Right now it's a little confusing!

<br><br>
6. <b>KNOWN</b> <strike>Tapping "Dress Up" on a pet does not automatically select that pet to dress up.

<br><br>
7. <b>KNOWN</b> <strike>Neoboard pen box is off-center.</strike> Acknowledged by gutterfoot on the boards in early June.
<br><br>
8. <b>FIXED</b> <strike>On the popup that appears when I click on a pet, the "Details" button has me confused. It's styled as all the other buttons, but it doesn't do anything. A screenreader user would be focused there and they need to orient themselves.</strike> Now goes to Pet lookup, though those aren't converted yet. Fixed in July update.
<br><br>
9. <b>FIXED</b> <strike>Mobile-only: when swiping between pets that have an umbrella vs. some that aren't tall, the placement of the pets (and their details button) is different.</strike> Fixed in July update.
<br><br>
10. <b>FIXED</b> <strike>Pet Details "less mobile-friendly lands" button is blue instead of green, like the other Yes buttons.</strike> Fixed in July update.
<br><br>
11. <b>FIXED</b> <strike>Dress Up" should say "Customise" to match existing UI.</strike> Fixed in July update.
<br><br>
12. <b>FIXED</b> <strike>The Community numbers only disappear for me in landscape. (On desktop they don't appear).</strike> Fixed in July update.
<br><br>
12. <b>FIXED</b> <strike>Colouring pages for a world load wonderfully on the first load, but if you use the phone's native Back button to go back to the Release Notes page and then load the same colouring page again, it loads with a bunch of CSS/HTML broken code and images at the top.</strike> Fixed in July update.
<br><br>
13. <b>UNABLE TO REPRODUCE</b> <strike>Giant Jelly World didn't load properly for me the first time I clicked the link from the Release Notes, which was odd. I opened the page and the only thing that greeted me was the text - the "?" button didn't load the question mark, either. When I tapped it, the rest of the text loaded, but the red button didn't have words on it. When I actually GOT jelly, that's when the Giant Jelly picture loaded and the text formatted, loaded, etc.</strike> Unable to reproduce in August update.
<br><br>
14. <b>FIXED</b> <strike>iPhone-only: Customisation does not load at all on this device, in either landscape or portrait.</strike> Fixed at some point in the past.
<br><br>15. <b>FIXED</b> <strike>The ghost text for the search bar should be lighter, since it's non-essential and doesn't need to meet contrast standards.</strike> Fixed at some point in the past.
<br><br>
15. <b>PRE-EXISTING</b> <strike>What is the "Wishlist" feature under "Availability"?</strike>
<br><br>
16. <b>UNABLE TO REPRODUCE</b> <strike> On the new homepage, the ad avertising the Black Friday sale suffers from a lack of spacing.</strike> Fixed at some point in the past.
<br><br>
17. <b>FIXED</b> <strike>When I tap "Login," the social media icons near the footer are really hard to see. There's no contrast requirement for these, but consider making them a darker color to match the text in the footer.</strike> Fixed at some point in the past.
<br><br>
18. <b>NOT A BUG, WAY IT WORKS</b> <strike>There's a line underneath some tabs in the inventory... but only some. I thought there was not a line because I had no type of that item, but as you can see, the line DOES appear on other tabs when there are no types of that item.</strike> Indicates you can swipe to more, but that's not how it <em>should</em> work.
<br><br>
19. <b>UNABLE TO REPRODUCE</b> <strike>I opened Kreludor in landscape and it did not take me to the mobile version of the site with all the links, and persisted in portrait and even after I'd visited other maps. It was the only one that did this.</strike> Not happening for me as of January 2021 update.
<br><br>
20. <b>FIXED</b> <strike>iPhone only: With Safari, there's no way to get rid of the navigation bars at the top or bottom, so Pet Care gets cut off oddly. Is there a way to fit this on the screen entirely?</strike> Pet Details now shows correctly.
<br><br>
21. <b>FIXED</b> <strike> Plain Shop Wiz - please allow refreshing to recommit the search. When searching for items like training codestones or paint brushes, it's a pain to have to go back and type your whole phrase again just to see... maybe the same section of results. (It's also a loss of functionality compared to the old version!)</strike> Added a Resubmit button in January 2021 update. 
<br><br>
22. <b>FIXED</b> <strike>Tapping "New Search" takes you back to the old Shop Wiz page, which gives you a 404 error.</strike> Fixed in January 2021 update. 
<br><br>23. <b>KNOWN</b> <strike>Trudy's Surprise notifications don't show up in the News sidebar until you visit an old site page.</strike> Acknowledged in Release Notes on January 29, 2021.
<br><br>
23. <b>UNABLE TO REPRODUCE</b> <strike>On my laptop, the right arrow to scroll pets seems to be cut off.</strike>
<br><br>
24. <b>FIXED</b> <strike>Cannot choose "No" in re-release capsules.</strike>
<br><br>
25. <b>FIXED</b> <strike>Grams and giftboxes seem to use the opposite heading in the modal window - gift boxes have a heading of "Use Gram," while grams have a heading of "Use Giftbox.</strike>
<br><br>
26. <b>FIXED</b> <strike>There are two wolves inside you and they both have different fonts. (TNT Altador Cup Staff Tournament buttons.)</strike> No longer appearing in 2022 Altador Cup. 
<br><br>
27. <b>UNABLE TO REPRODUCE</b> <strike>Sometimes the gram images cover up the "Sent confirmation" message (the real one).</strike> Unable to reproduce as of July 19, 2022.
<br><br>
28. <b>UNABLE TO REPRODUCE</b> <strike>Some grams are giving me the "Sent confirmation" message before I've actually sent the item, which is BAD.</strike> Unable to reproduce as of July 19, 2022.
<br><br>
29. <b>FIXED</b> <strike>I can't see my Petpets anywhere.</strike> 
<br><br>
30. <b>NOT A BUG, WAY IT WORKS</b> <strike>Consider adding a "Neoboards" link to the sidebar.</strike> It's here to stay in the "Community" submenu, I guess.
<br><br>
31. <b>FIXED</b> <strike>Brain Tree typo: missing space between "developed" and "intelligence.</strike>
<br><br>
32. <b>FIXED</b> <strike>Brain Tree typo: "saidthat" instead of "said that" (missing space). </strike>
