The number and T means how many times we have got that place so like 18th is 5T because we got 18th place five times, for the past 14 years of playing Moltara has gotten 1st, 2nd, 3rd 1T , 4th, 5th, 6th 1T, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th 1T, 13th 1T, 14th, 15th 1T, 16th, 17th 4T, 18th 5T, but that just means we keep on trying in till we get it right and make a place for us in the altador cup.  Next year will be 2024 and the nineteenth altador cup we hope to see all the teams there. <br><br><font size="4"><font color="40AAC0">Game Play</font> How to play the games are simple for the side games you use the arrow keys, space bar and the letter keys for<br><font size="4"><font color="FFCC00">Shout Out Show Down</font> the main point of this game is to make it into the goal by using the arrow keys and the space bar to shot the maximum score you can get is 1,200 points.<br><font size="4"><font color="407E1">Make Some Nose</font> for this game you use the letter keys that are on the keyboard what ever keys pop up on the screen you have to press and keep on pressing when a letter key shows up on the top of the screen press it you will get more points the minimum score you need is 3,000.<br><font size="4"><font color=" E11718">Slushie Slinger</font> in this game you control a red tuskaninny your job is to make sure the neopets who on in line get their slushie if you give them the wrong slushie it does not matter you will get points, but not has much if you gave them the right one, there are three lines from top to bottom short to longest the minimum score you need is 300 points.<br><br><font size="4"><font color="953C00">Yooyuball</font> is the main game of the altador cup from 2005 to 2010 you would use the mouse to control the players on your team but in 2011 and we had to use the arrow keys in 2012 they brought back the mouse control along with using the arrow keys so you could pick which one you wanted just keep on trying the point of this is like soccer you try and get the ball in the other teams net.<br><br><br><table border="2"><tr><td>Ranks</td>
