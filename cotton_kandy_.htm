<i class="text2">hello</i> and welcome to my Guide to the Beauty Contest! My name is <b>bc jedi master ani</b> (more on the BC Jedi etc. later) and I've been entering the BC for almost as long as I've been on neo! I've seen the good &amp; the bad of the BC as it has changed throughout the years. I decided I wanted to create a guide to share what I have learned with the community

<p>
I've tried to make this page as easy as possible to use. The navigation on the top will take you to each section of the page. Each section has terms and definitions that you should know when entering the Beauty Contest and will link you back to the glossary in case you forget the definitions.</p>

<center><p><i>may the (bc) force be with you!</i></p></center>

<i class="text2">the</i> BC doesn't change very much, but when it does, this is the place to look. All current updates about the BC will be here! Make sure to check this section so you can stay up-to-date on all BC related news.

<b>Q.</b> <i>What time does the BC start?</i>

<p><b>A.</b> As of July 13, 2012: 12 PM NST every Friday!</p>


<br><p><b>Q.</b> <i>Can I enter on a side account?</i></p>
<p>

<b>A.</b> As of April 4, 2008: YES! You can enter on a side account. You can only advertise from the account the pet is on though!</p>

<br><p><b>Q.</b> <i>How many pets can I enter at a time?</i></p>
<p>

<b>A.</b> As many as you like! You can enter all of the pets you own, but keep in mind you need to advertise on your separate accounts for the pets!</p>

<br><p><b>Q.</b> <i>How many votes do I have?</i></p>

<p><b>A.</b> One vote for each Neopets' species each contest.</p>

<br><p><b>Q.</b> <i>What do I get for winning?</i></p>
<p>

<b>A.</b> You can get a shiny trophy for your pet's <a href="//www.neopets.com/prizes.phtml">Trophy Cabinet</a>! It will show up on their lookup as well.</p>

<br><p><b>Q.</b> <i>How do I get the avatar?</i></p>
<p>

<b>A.</b> Place 1st, 2nd, 3rd in species or overall with your entry! The avatar is not retro-active, so if you won the BC before the avatar was active, but haven't won a trophy since, you will need to re-enter and place with your entry to get the avatar.</p>

<p>Those things seem pretty simple to follow right? If you stick to those rules, your entry should get uploaded to the Neopets server and entered into the contest!</p>


<p>There are still a few things to consider, though, before you enter the contest. Read on to learn more about those considerations</p>

<h2 style="border-radius: 5px;">☞ species difficulties</h2>

Certain species of Neopets are harder to place in than others. Generally, the more popular species are harder because there are a larger number of people who can enter.

<p>The number of entries in each species has decreased dramatically since around 2014. Fewer entries means more chances for your image to win. The species below are guidelines, but sometimes there are only 3 entries in categories--a guaranteed trophy!

</p><p>The page below gathers data from different contests to determine how popular different species are. Check it out for some hard data and numbers about species popularity (and, therefore, difficulty)!</p>

<p align="center">
<a href="/~Colress" title="BC Species Popularity by Number of Entries"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/neQxI9e.gif"></a>
</p>


<h3>Easy Species</h3>

<b>definition:</b> Consists of the more unpopular Neopet species. These species can sometimes have 0-3 entries for one week. Usually less-advertised on the board.

<p align="center">Bruce <b>|</b> Chia <b>|</b> Chomby <b>|</b> Elephante <b>|</b> Flotsam <b>|</b> Grarrl <b>|</b> Grundo <b>|</b> Jetsam <b>|</b> JubJub <b>|</b> Kiko <b>|</b> Koi <b>|</b> Lenny <b>|</b> Meerca <b>|</b> Moehog <b>|</b> Mynci <b>|</b> Nimmo <b>|</b> Ogrin <b>|</b> Quiggle <b>|</b> Ruki <b>|</b> Scorchio <b>|</b> Tonu <b>|</b> Tuskanniny <b>|</b> Vandagyre</p>


<h3>Medium Species</h3>

<b>definition:</b> Usually those that are somewhat more popular Neopets species. Will usually have 3+ entries a week. Can also be species that fluctuate between few entries and lots of entries each week.

<p align="center">Acara <b>|</b> Blumaroo <b>|</b> Bori <b>|</b> Buzz <b>|</b> Eyrie <b>|</b> Gnorbu <b>|</b> Hissi <b>|</b> Korbat <b>|</b> Poogle <b>|</b> Pteri <b>|</b> Shoyru <b>|</b> Skeith <b>|</b> Techo <b>|</b> Usul <b>|</b> Wocky <b>|</b> Yurble <b>|</b> Zafara</p>


<h3>Hard Species</h3>

<b>definition:</b> Consists of the more popular Neopet species. There are usually a full page or two of entries each week. These species also usually have lots of well drawn images with people who advertise heavily.

<p align="center">Aisha <b>|</b> Cysbunny <b>|</b> Draik <b>|</b> Gelert <b>|</b> Ixi <b>|</b> Kacheek <b>|</b> Kougra <b>|</b> Krawk <b>|</b> Kyrii <b>|</b> Lupe <b>|</b> Peophin <b>|</b> Uni <b>|</b> Xweetok</p>


<h2>☞ time of year</h2>

As odd as it may seem, you also should consider the time of year you enter the BC. At certain times of the year more people enter, which could reduce the chance of a new trophy for your pet! Here are the times of year when the BC is most active:<p>

</p>
<center><blockquote>
<b>◊</b> Winter holidays
<br><b>◊</b> Summertime
<br><b>◊</b> Holidays like Halloween or Valentine's Day
<br><b>◊</b> User-run theme weeks
</blockquote></center>


<p>Usually the BC is busiest at the time when people are on breaks from school because there is more free time to go on Neopets! This might be the best time for you to enter as well, so just be ready for a lot of competition! Also, people like to dress their pet up for special holidays that come around, so Halloween, St Patrick's Day, or Valentine's Day can be busy times to enter.</p>

<p>If you can enter at an "off" time, you might have less competition. Be sure to pick a week where your schoolwork or job isn't so hectic, so you still have time to advertise.</p>

<div class="content" align="justify">


<i class="text2">now</i> comes the fun part about the BC! It's time for you to start drawing your BC entry! There are several methods you can use to make your artwork. Don't worry if you've never draw before. Just try it out for fun!

<h2>☞ ways to create your BC entry</h2>

There are a variety of ways to create your artwork for the Beauty Contest. Read the sections below to find out ways to create your entry either with traditional methods or with digital ones.

<h3>Traditional Art</h3>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>Traditional Art</b> - When you draw art without using a computer or technology, it's considered traditional art. Grab some paper and a pencil and you can get started!

<p>Here are some materials you can use to create an entry <i>traditionally</i>:</p>

<center><p></p><blockquote>
<b>◊</b> Watercolors
<br><b>◊</b> Crayons
<br><b>◊</b> Markers
<br><b>◊</b> Colored pencils
<br><b>◊</b> Other paints
</blockquote></center>

<p>This is an image that would be considered "traditional art". I drew it in my sketchbook with colored pencils:</p>

<center><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4JjuV1j.jpg" border="1" width="375"></p></center>

<p>It's important to note when drawing a traditional art entry, you will need a way to get it onto the computer. A <i>scanner</i> will give you the best quality for this. If you don't have a scanner, you can use a digital camera or the camera on your phone. There are also scanning apps available for your phone.</p>

<p>When taking a photo of your entry be sure the artwork is well lit and the lighting is even without any shadows casting on it. Be sure to crop out anything in the background (like the table your art is on), so just your artwork is in the frame.</p>

<p><i>Note:</i> 3D art, such as sculptures are not allowed in the BC. The artwork must be considered a drawing or painting.</p>

<h3>Digital Art</h3>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Digital Art</b> - When you draw a picture on a computer or tablet (i.e. iPad) you are creating digital art!</p>

<p>There are different programs you can use to create art on the computer. Some of them are free, but some are not. A <i>**</i> indicates there is an option for a free version! Here is a selection of programs you have to chose from:</p>

<center><p></p><blockquote>
<b>◊</b> Adobe Photoshop
<br><b>◊</b> Procreate
<br><b>◊</b> MS Paint <i>**</i>
<br><b>◊</b> Photopea <i>**</i>
<br><b>◊</b> Paint Tool SAI 
<br><b>◊</b> GIMP <i>**</i>
<br><b>◊</b> Clip Studio Paint 
<br><b>◊</b> FireAlpaca <i>**</i>
<br><b>◊</b> Krita <i>**</i>
<br><b>◊</b> Ibis Paint <i>**</i>
<br><b>◊</b> MediBang <i>**</i>
</blockquote></center>

<p>This is an image that would be considered "digital art". I used a tablet to draw and color it in Adobe Photoshop:</p>

<center><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uJH9EFV.png" border="1" width="375"></p></center>


<h2>☞ types of pet stances</h2>

Once you've figured out if you are going to draw you BC image digitally or traditionally, the next thing you need to decide on is how your pet is going to look, or how they are "built". What do I mean by that? Well, there are two ways that are acceptable in the Beauty Contest: Anthropomorphic (Anthro) and Quadruped (Quad).

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Anthro Pets</b> - These are pets with human characteristics! They walk on two legs and can wear clothes. <i>Note: This does NOT mean a human with ears!</i></p>


<center>
<p><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/465_tfr_hanso_complains.gif" width="150" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 7px; padding: 5px;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/art/misc/sophie10.gif" width="150" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 7px; padding: 5px;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/tradingcards/lg_310.gif" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 7px; padding: 5px;" width="150"><br><i>TNT's version of Anthro Ixi.</i>
</p></center>


<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Quad Pets</b> - These are pets that generally walk on all 4 legs. They have more animal-like qualities than humans.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="//images.neopets.com/art/misc/sinsi9.gif" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 7px; padding: 5px;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/caption/caption_925.gif" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 7px; padding: 5px;" width="150"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/tradingcards/lg_315.gif" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 7px; padding: 5px;" width="150"><br><i>TNT's version of Quadruped Ixi.</i>
</p><p></p></center>


<h2>☞ important do's and don'ts!</h2>

Here are some things to remember when you are drawing your entry and getting ready to enter the contest! These things are very important. Some of them will help to ensure that your entry is acceptable by the Contest Judge's rules, so be sure to pay attention!

<h3>things you can do in the bc</h3>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>DO be creative</b> - Unlike other site spotlights on Neo, like the Art Gallery or Neopian Times, you are allowed to enter a picture of you pet with its "custom design" -- you don't need to stick to just a Red Gelert or an Island Ixi. If your pet has unique markings or clothing, you are allowed to draw them like that and enter the BC. <i>Note: You may draw a pet a different COLOR than it actually is!</i></p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>You CAN have a background</b> - Sometimes a background will show that you have put more work into your BC entry and will generate more votes. Be wary though, because backgrounds can make your image look cluttered or distorted and Manual Voters might shy away from viewing your entry. <i>Note: You cannot use a photograph as a background image.</i></p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>DO make your image look like a Neopet</b> - Your entry needs to resemble the Neopet species it is more than a human or animal when you enter the BC. Your entry won't be accepted by the Contest Judge if it looks "too human" or "too realistic". Also, you must draw your Neopet in the species it CURRENTLY is... not what you hope it will be one day! (So, if your pet is a Kau, you need to draw it as a Kau, not a Draik!)</p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>You CAN enter an animation</b> - As long as you can get it under the 75kb file limit, you are allowed to enter an animation into the BC. Usually they are just eye blinks, but I've seen them go as complicated as a running Lupe!</p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>You ARE allowed to use Neopets images</b> - If the image came from neopets.com artists you may utilize it for the BC. You do need to alter or edit it in someway.</p>

<h3>things you can't do in the bc</h3>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>DO NOT use art that you found</b> - Art that you enter into the BC must be made by YOU. This means: 1. no collaborations with another user 2. no makeables that you colored in 3. no image of a "Baby Xweetok" that you searched for and found on Google or another website. If it was not created by you or is official neopets artwork you altered you cannot enter it in the BC.</p>

<center><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/aBec8Xr.png" border="1" width="600"><br><i>As seen on the "Enter Contest" page. (Drag to address bar for full view).</i>
</p></center>


<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>no photography</b> - Whether or not the photo was taken by you, the BC is not the place to use a photograph in any part of your image (including as a background). You can use a camera to digitally capture your draw or painted entry, but you should crop out everything but the drawing.</p>

<center><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/r8yYOzs.png" border="1"><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=272">[source]</a></p>
</center>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>DO NOT put (c) or your art website on your entry</b> - It is important to put identification on your image incase it get stolen (and the art thief dumbly forgets to remove any text--it happens!). On the flip side, you can't put "(c) USERNAME" or your off-site art account (or any offsite website for that matter). You should simply put your username somewhere on your entry. To be on the safe side, I have started putting the username of the account the pet is on when I entered my image.</p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>AI "art" is NOT allowed</b> - TNT has made a stance that AI "art" is not allowed in creative contests such as the Beauty Contest. <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=973">[source]</a></p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>No 3D art is allowed</b> - This includes both traditional 3D art (sculptures, plushies etc) as well as digital 3D art. If that is your medium, the Art Gallery should be where you enter your images and not the BC. <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=944">[source]</a></p>

<a name="6"><h1>how to save your entry</h1></a>

<div class="content" align="justify">


<i class="text2">once</i> you have drawn your entry, its time to save it to enter it in the contest! Saving an entry for the Beauty Contest is one of the hardest things to do when you first start out in the BC. There are specific requirements for the BC, so sometimes getting them to fit those requirements can be tricky, especially since the requirements are a little dated.

<h2>☞ saving: tips from a pro</h2>

<p>First, I want to tell you some tips I've learned over the years of BCing. These don't necessarily have to do with getting your image to fit the requirements, but they are good to keep in mind when you are going to save your entry!</p> 

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>resize your entry to 800 pixels wide or smaller</b> - Whether you are working in a large canvas in photoshop, or your photo or scanned image file is really large, reducing the  height and width of your entry will help you overall. Smaller dimensions means the filesize will be less, which will help you get it under 75kb.

<p>The second reason to keep your entry to a <i>maximum 800 pixels wide</i> is because you will stretch out the entry screen. I entered my Kau, below, to show you what happens if you have a long photo. This can cause some people to have to scroll left and right to see your image! When you are in the BC you want everything about it to be as easy as possible for the potential voter, and making them scroll isn't  helping you at all!</p>

<center><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/CXWLWOx.png" border="1" width="600"><br><i>Keep your entries under 800 pixels long or you'll stretch the voting page! <br>(Drag to address bar for full view).</i></p>
</center>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Background vs. no background</b> - I touched on this before in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Cotton_Kandy_#prep">Drawing &amp; Preparing your BC Entry</a> section, but its also important to consider when you're about to save an image for the BC!</p>

<p>As I said before, having a background makes your piece look like it has a lot more effort put into it. The drawback is it can deter from Manual Voters, because the thumbnail won't be as clear! When saving your image for the BC, you might consider erasing the background, or cropping the image so not all of the background is showing. These two things can also reduce the filesize, which again will help to get your image to the 75kb filesize limit! </p>


<center><p>
</p><table border="0" cellspacing="10"><tr><td>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/zXveXxa.jpg" width="275" border="1"></td>

</tr></table><br><i>Right: Image with background (used for petpage layout). <br>Left: Background removed, and ready to enter into the BC!</i>
</center>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Reduce the quality instead of cropping your image</b> - A lot of times when people are trying to get their image under 75k, they will crop the image or resize it really small! Instead of cropping until all you have is a headshot of your pet, reduce the quality of the image first! (I will go over this in the "how to save in certain programs" sections below)</p>

</tr></table><br><i>The one on the left isn't as awesome looking as the one on the right!<br>Before you crop that far, try reducing the quality of the image!</i>
</center>

<h2>☞ faq about saving &amp; resizing</h2>

One of the most asked things about entering the BC for the first time is "how do I resize and save my entry?". I hope to answer a couple of frequently asked questions about this process in hopes to make it easier for you. If you don't see the answers here, you can also make a board on the Art Chat and people who are more experienced in the contest will always be willing to answer!

<p><b>Q.</b> <i>What program should I use to save my entry?</i>
<br><b>A.</b> In most programs you can save directly in the program you are working in! Look for a "Save For Web" or "Export" option on your menu!</p>

<p><b>Q.</b> <i>I am using Procreate and I am having trouble resizing my entry. What do I do?</i>
<br><b>A.</b> I realllyyy don't like saving my BC entries in Procreate. I usually export it as a PNG and use photopea.com (free photoshop) to save it as a JPG under 75kb. (File → Export As → jpg).

<div class="content" align="justify">

<i class="text2">alright,</i> now that you are thoroughly prepared and read EVERYTHING to do and think about before you enter, it's time for what you are really here for: <i>How do I enter the BC??</i>

<p>Once you are at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/beauty/index.phtml">BC Main Page</a> click on: <a href="//www.neopets.com/beauty/upload.phtml">Enter Contest</a></p>

<p>You'll see on this page that there is a lot of text at the top. You should read over that so you can understand a few of the BC Rules :)</p>

<p>Next, you'll see all the pets you own on that account! There should be one box for each of them. The boxes should each look something like this:</p>

<center><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mkI0Lwb.png"></p></center>

<p>You'll see your pet's name, an unconverted image of them, and a statement that says if they are entered in the contest or not. Next you'll see entering is as easy as <i>1, 2, 3!</i></p>

<p><b>step 1:</b> The first thing is a little rectangle with a button next to it. Click the button that says "Browse" and find where you saved your image on your computer, phone, or tablet. Select the image and hit "open".</p>

<p><b>step 2:</b> Next, you are asked to write a speech to the judges. This part is really not a big deal, so don't stress! Most people write things like: <i>Please vote for me in the BC?</i> or <i>Look at me! Aren't I cute? Check my petpage for a better version!</i></p>

<p><b>step 3:</b> Finally, click "Enter _____ " and BAM! You're entered for the next upcoming Beaty Contest!</p>

<p>Easy as pie!</p>

<div class="content" align="justify">

<i class="text2">sometimes</i> when you try and enter the contest things can go wrong. It's nothing any of us are anticipating, but it does happen! This section is here to help you with any errors or issues you have when you enter the beauty contest.

<h2>☞ error at the entry page</h2>

The first place you may encounter a snag is when you are trying to submit your picture at the entry page. When you click the "Enter _____" button a message like this may come up (there should be nothing else, but the message on the page):

<center><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/vczEp98.png" width="600" border="1"><br><i>(drag to address bar for full view)</i></p></center>

<p>If you get this message, your entry did NOT even go through to the Contest Judge. It did NOT follow the two requirements of the picture when entering (filetype and filesize). You will need to save it correctly in order for the image to go through. </p>

<p>If you get the above message, go back to your file on your computer and double check it to see what may be wrong.</p>

<p></p><center><a href="#pop2"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Tb9ybGx.png"></a></center>

<p>Click the above link for information on finding your filesize.</p>

<h2>☞ rejection after you entered a picture</h2>

Now, if you do NOT get the error message seen above, you entry will be successfully entered into the next contest. Your page should look something like this:

<center><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/PHQhVqW.png" style="border: 1px solid black;" width="600"><br><i>A successfully entered pet VS. a pet not entered into the contest.<br> (Drag to address bar for full view)</i>
</p></center>

<p>See how instead of the default (and UC version) neopets image of your pet, your art and speech are there?</p>

<p>Your pet is then officially entered into the next contest! However, there is still a possibility--between when you successfully enter and the start of the next contest--that your entry could get kicked out of the contest. :( If this happens, you will get a <b>Neomail</b> from the <i>contest_judge</i> (an Official account of TNT). It looks like this:</p>

<center><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/2w7J21X.png" width="600" border="1"><br><i> (Drag to address bar for full view)</i>
</p></center>

<p>The neomail doesn't explain much does it? I'll try and break down a few of the common reasons on why this happens in the subsequent sections.</p>

<h2>☞ rejection during the contest</h2>

If you successfully enter the contest and don't get rejected before it starts, there is still a possibility that you can get disqualified from the contest while you pet is currently in it. 

<p>If your entry was removed from the contest after it starts, you will receive this Neomail from the <i>contest_judge</i>:</p>

<center><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/iFQQZx9.png" width="600" border="1"><br><i>Rejection neomail during the contest.<br>(Drag to address bar for full view)</i></p>
</center>

<p>If your entry was removed during the contest it was honestly most likely that someone reported your entry for not following the contest rules. Sometimes Kikocat misses things in her review of entries before the contest starts (she's only one human afterall), and users do have the option of reporting an entry. If they report your entry, it could be because of the reasons I will list below. The contest judge will then review the report and decide if your entry should stay in the BC or be removed.</p>

<p>Read below to find out more about why your entry might have been removed.</p>

<h2>☞ common reasons for being removed</h2>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>You entered an "unedited" neopets image</b> - This means that you used an image drawn by the artists at Neopets and entered it into the contest without making any alterations to the image. You may use official Neopets images, as long as you have made some changes to them to make the image your own! Here is an example of the difference between the two: (edited version by <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=mindsend">mindsend</a>. Used with permission.)</p>

<center><p>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/pets/ixi_grey_baby.gif" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 7px; padding: 5px;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LCV4yx2.png" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 7px; padding: 5px;" width="150"><br><i>On the left we have an unedited neopets picture. On the right we have an edited version.</i></p></center>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>You entered a customization image of you pet</b> - This is similar to the reason above. This is considered an unedited Neopets image that you did not draw on to alter. If you would like to show off your pet's customization, you can enter them into the <a href="//www.neopets.com/spotlights/custompet/index.phtml">Customization Contest</a>.</p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>There was a (c) symbol on your entry</b> - As I said in my <a href="#prep">Drawing and Preparing your BC Entry</a> section, you are not allowed to have a copyright (c) symbol or a link to an off-site website on your image. Simply remove it, add your neopets username, and re-enter your artwork!</p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Your pet looked too much like, or was dressed like a copyrighted character</b> - Characters such as Pokemon, Harry Potter, or Disney are very recognizable. Because of copyright laws, Neopets does not allow images in the contest that closely resembles other copyrighted characters.</p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Your image was too realistic</b> - While you may be very good at drawing animals, or you may have used a photograph of a real animal as a reference for your image, this is a contest on <i>Neopets</i>, so your image must resemble a Neopet more than a real life animal. Try to include aspects of the Neopet in your drawing!</p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Your anthro drawing is too human-like</b> - Same as above, this is a <i>Neopets</i> contest, so your entry needs to look more like a Neopet than a human! Kikocat has said that she generally judges by the nose: if you have a human or human-like nose, then you will most likely be rejected. Also, be wary of the skin/fur color. If your Neopet is Anthro, but also has fur that couple be considered a skin tone, it may be mistaken as just a human rather than a Neopet. (Honestly, this usually happens with light beige or tan colored fur, which is a whole other discussion we could unpack). Another thing to be aware of is your anatomy. Make sure its neo-appropriate! <i>In summary, your entry can be considered "too human" for these reasons:</i></p>

<center><p></p><blockquote>
<b>◊</b> human-shaped nose
<br><b>◊</b> fur is skin-toned
<br><b>◊</b> inappropriate (not neo safe) anatomy
</blockquote></center>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Using firefox to upload your entry</b> - If you tend to use Firefox as your primary browser, you may want to use another one (such as Chrome) to upload your BC image. Sometime Firefox can send in a blank image as opposed to your entry, and therefore the Contest Judge will reject it.</p>

<p>Besides those reasons above, Kikocat mentioned that she also looks for these things to reject an entry from the contest (either before it starts, or during the current contest):</p>

<center><p></p><blockquote><i class="text">
<b>◊</b> art theft
<br><b>◊</b> photographs 
<br><b>◊</b> anything not drawn (sculptures)
<br><b>◊</b> anything that violates any site or chat rules
<br><b>◊</b> religious symbols
<br><b>◊</b> URLs
<br><b>◊</b> country flags
</i></blockquote></center>

<p>If your entry contains any of the above reasons it will be removed form the contest. One that is of special interest to me, and other BCers is art theft. If you'd like to learn more about <i>art theft</i> please click the link below!</p>

<h2>☞ other reasons your entry was removed</h2>

The BC has gone through some subtle changes lately, so it's important to note that some entries have been removed during the contest for reasons other than what was mentioned above.

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Spamming your BC link</b> - If you are advertising your entry on a board other than the Art Chat it is important to not spam people with your entry. Be sure to contribute to the conversation and stay on topic! Bumping your board with your BC link can also be considered spamming if done off the Art Chat.</p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Your link was in the neoHTML part of your font</b> - As silly as it may seem, your link to your BC entry must remain in the neoSignature part of the font, not the neoHTML part. This is because people are able to turn off seeing other people's signatures.</p>

<p>I'll talk a little bit more about the do's and don't's of advertising and your neoSignature in the next couple of sections!</p>

<p>If you'd like the tl;dr version of why you have gotten rejected or a warning, please see the page below:</p>

<h4><b>Terms to Know</b>
<br><a href="#advert">Advertising</a> |  
<a href="#boards">Art Chat</a></h4>

<div class="content" align="justify">

<i class="text2">now</i> that you have successfully entered the contest. . . Now what? NOW comes the hard part! A week-long trek of advertising! What is advertising and how do I do it? Read on to find out!
<p>

<b>Advertising</b> is when you display and post your entry so that others will see it and vote for you. The more people that see your entry, the more votes you can possibly get. The more votes you get, the greater chance you will place 1st, 2nd, or 3rd and get a shiny trophy for your pet! Cool, huh?</p>
<p>

The number one thing you need to advertise is the URL to your BC entry:</p>
<p>

</p><center>
<b>* * *</b>  <i>//www.neopets.com/beauty/details.phtml?pet=YOURPETNAMEHERE</i>  <b>* * *</b>
</center>
<p>

Replace "YOURPETNAMEHERE" with the name of your pet that you entered in the contest and you have your entry URL!</p>


<h2>☞ where to advertise</h2>

There are several places where you can advertise so that people may see your Beauty Contest entry.<p>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>Your Userlookup</b> - Putting the image and a link to your entry on your userlookup can be helpful for people who lookup your username or click your name when you are chatting on the NeoBoards. <i>You may only put the link on the account the pet you entered is on</i></p>
<p>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>Your Pet's Lookup</b> - Again, this is a great place to put a link to your entry. Someone may search your pet and visit their lookup, see your entry and vote!</p>
<p>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>Your Pet's Web Page</b> - This is the second best place to put your entry! Someone may be looking through pages via other pet pages and see you're in the BC and vote for you! Another great thing about petpages is they are linked from your pet's BC entry page. On a petpage you can put a better version of your picture, which may generate more votes! </p>
<p>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>The Art Boards</b> - The number one place to get votes is the board designed for us: <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=13">The Art Board</a>. Putting your BC entry URL into your neoHTML or pasting it on your board for people to see is the fastest way to get your entry out there! Who knows how many people were lurking (not posting) and saw your entry?!</p>

<h2>☞ rules about advertising</h2>

There are certain rules you have to follow when advertising your pet's entry in the Beauty Contest. Make sure you do these, so you don't get removed from the contest!

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>You can only advertise for your own BC entry</b> - You may think that your friend or guildmate's entry is awesome, but you are not allowed to advertise for them. This is considered cheating in the Beauty Contest. It's not a fair way to get votes.</p>


<p></p><center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/qpHnPuk.png" border="1"><br>{{ <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=251">source</a> }}</center>

<p>If you are caught advertising an entry that is not your own, you could cause your friend's entry to be removed from the contest! Definitely not worth the risk.</p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>You can only advertise from the account your pet is located on</b> - You can only advertise your entry from the account that it lives on. So, if you enter one pet on your main account and one pet on your side account in the same week, you will have to log in and out of each account to advertise for each entry.</p>

<p>This also includes petpages, lookups, and userlookups. You can only put your entries up for the pets that live on those accounts.

</p><center>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>You can only advertise on certain boards</b> - While you have your entry in your neoSignature, remember to only stick to the Premium, Spotlight, or Art boards. These are the places TNT has said it is appropriate to advertise your entry on. Users have confirmed that their entry has gotten removed for posting on other boards.</p>

<p></p><center>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/cCMINvB.png" border="1"><br>{{ <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=690">source</a> }}</center>

<p>The reason for this is because of neopets chat rules relating to spam. If the post isn't about what it should be about for that board, technically it is spam.</p>

<i class="text2">alright</i> friends! Its time for a crash-course in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=13">Art Chat</a> (formerly known as the Beauty Contest Boards). If you are new to the board, this is good to read, so you can understand the dynamics of how we operate! In a nutshell, we are <i>a quiet and self-sustaining board</i>.


<p>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>The General Art Chat</b> - Before the name changed, there was no one place to talk about art or other creative endeavors on neo. On the Art Chat you can talk about your art, petpage making, adoptables, as well as your BC entry!</p>
<p>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>Trolls are Rare</b> - It's very unlikely that you will find posts or topics just to annoy people. Occasionally we will get the newbie who thinks its a topic about make-up and celebrities, but 95% of the boards are on-topic.</p>
<p>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>We aren't Report-Happy (unless you steal our art!)</b> - If you are doing something wrong, a lot of times people will tell you (nicely), rather than just report you right away. If someone points out that you aren't following the rules. . . listen! :) There are a lot of BC oldies who have experience in the BC and know it inside and out. We want to educate you, not get you into trouble.</p>
<p>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>The "Contest Judge" is a person named Kikocat</b> - Unlike other places on the site where TNT is a huge entity that doesn't listen to you, here in the BC we have a member of TNT named Amanda, who is watching over us. She monitors the boards at times, admits entries into the contest, and deletes them if you are found not following the rules. A lot of BCers have her email and are in direct contact with her to clarify rules and report problems.</p>
<p>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>This is NOT the Pound Chat!</b> - Some people may spam the PC for votes (please see next section), but when you come to the Beauty Contest Board remember this: we don't care if your pet is Uncoverted or nicely painted or rare. We care about your <i>art</i>.</p>

<h2>☞ types of boards</h2>

Since the Art Chat now encompasses both the BC and the general art chat, you will find a variety of topics here.


<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Voting Boards</b> - These boards are where people will advertise that they are voting for other's BC entries. There are a couple of different ways to vote. They may advertise that they are Silently Voting, or Non-Silently Voting, or voting Manually.
</p>
<p>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>Vote For Me! Boards</b> - Boards advertising the person's pet. These are for other contestants and lurking voters to come take a look at their entry and hopefully gain a vote!
</p>
<p>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>Critique Boards</b> - Critique boards--whether offering or asking for them--are to help artists improve. If you are giving a critique, be sure to mention what they are doing well in their art as well as what they can improve on. A "Critique Sandwich" is a good thing to keep in mind:

</p>
<center>
<blockquote>

<b>1.</b> Something that they are doing well 
<br><b>2.</b> Something to improve upon 
<br><b>3.</b> Something they are doing well or an overall assessment of the artwork
</blockquote>
</center>
<p>

Here's an example of the above "Critique Sandwich": <i>Wow! I love that you added a background to your BC entry. The perspective on it is a little off though, maybe try looking at photographs as a reference to help with that. Overall, it is a strong piece!</i>
</p>
<p>

When giving a critique it's important to remember there is a person behind that username! Don't be afraid to ask or receive feedback on your artwork. It's how you can grow as an artist!
</p>
<p>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>Art Requests &amp; Trades</b> - Sometimes people will advertise that they are willing to draw art for other people. <i>Art Trade</i> means you each draw art for each other. It's important to remember if you partake in an art trade, to get your half done in a timely manner! <i>Art Request</i> means you do not have to draw anything in return for a piece of art. They are doing this out of the goodness of their heart!
</p>
<p>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>Adoptable Boards</b> - Adoptables are free images you can use. Usually they are done in multiples of the different pet colors and species.
</p>
<p>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>User-Run Competitions</b> - Sometimes users like to host their own competitions (free of prizes, except bragging rights!). These are generally art or drawing competitions with rules, prompts, and community-building. Most notable examples are: <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Dnxi">Operation Style</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Lyesia">shIIne</a>
</p>

<p>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>User-Run Theme Weeks</b> - Theme weeks have been going on for years. Recently, they have begun to pick back up in popularity. Theme weeks are generally organized by one or a few users together. They will pick a theme and a BC week that the theme week will take place. When users enter the BC that week they can enter a picture around a certain theme. <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Tedu">Click here</a> for a page on recent theme weeks.
</p>

<p>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>Art &amp; Character Guild Topics</b> - A lot of times users are looking to find others who have the same interests as them. People who are a part of art or character guilds will sometimes advertise them here. Keep a look out if that's something you're interested in.
</p>

<p>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>The BC Fun Board</b> - Usually these are numbered, because once one board ends, another will begin! This is a general chat board to connect with other artists and BCers.
</p>



</div></div>


<div class="main" style="border-radius: 10px;">

<a name="11"><h1>beauty contest etiquette</h1></a>

<div class="content" align="justify">

<i class="text2">just</i> like any other game, it's important to have good sportsmanship when competing in the BC. Here's a couple of suggestions that you should consider when entering the BC and when you interact with your fellow artists.

<h2>☞ good BC etiquette</h2>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>Comment on others entries</b> - Often times your fellow BCers will make a board advertising that they are now voting. Its a common courtesy to look at their entry and comment about it. (It would be ill advised to say that you hate their entry... even if you do...)
<p>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>Limit how many times you use an image</b> - There are no rules against entering the same piece of art into the BC more than once. That said, BCers feel that if you've already won a trophy with it once, you shouldn't enter it again. This is your chance to try something new!</p>

<p><i>Important Note: If you've won an Art Gallery trophy with a piece of art, you may not enter it in the BC!</i></p>


<h2>☞ unfavorable BC etiquette</h2>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>Do NOT copy and paste the same message to every topic</b> - Have a cookie-cutter "Vote for me!" message is just annoying (not to mention its considered spam, and you can be reported for it!). Instead, tailor your posts to the topic. Read the first post and interact with your fellow BCers! Its a good way to make friends!

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Do NOT ask for a vote from your same-species competition</b> - Most of the time people vote for their own pets in the BC, so its pretty useless to ask for a vote from someone who is competing in the same species as you. </p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Don't insult your competition</b> - Claiming you have the "best entry" in your species is another way of saying your competition's entries aren't very good at all. Remember this contest is for fun, and all skil levels are welcome to compete in the BC!</p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Don't start the Traditional Art vs. Digital Art argument</b> - For the love of Fyora, Traditional Art isn't harder than Digital Art or vise versa. Both take time and skil to become good at. Some people prefer one over the other, but that doesn't mean there is a "right" way to create art.</p>

<h2>☞ BC faux pas</h2>

A "faux pas" is a <i>violation of accepted social norms</i> and comes from the French meaning "false step". This doesn't mean these things are against the rules or necessarily rude behavior on the BC boards. Instead, they are things that are <i>overused, annoying, or pet peeves.</i>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>❝It's my first time in the BC. Vote for me?❞</b> - Although it would be nice, you may not win a trophy on your first try. I see this line used over and over and by now its just stale and has lost any meaning to even get votes.</p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>❝Vote for my UC/expensive color pet?❞</b> - The competition should be about your artwork that you entered rather than how rare your pet is considered. (Also it makes you look at bit pretentious).</p>


<h2>☞ bc spam</h2>

This topic seems to be less and less important in recent years. It was commonplace to find BCers advertising on other neoboards besides the Art Chat. Although always against the rules, this "BC spam" was hardly ever enforced.

<p>As of Fall 2014, TNT started removing entries from the Beauty Contest if they found them posting outside the Art Chat to get votes. Instead of warnings for spam, the punishment for "BC Spam" now is a lot harsher and doesn't seem to be worth the risk. <i>Stick to the Art Chat to get votes from now on folks!</i></p>

<div class="main" style="border-radius: 10px;">

<a name="12"><h1>voting</h1></a>

<div class="content" align="justify">

<i class="text2">whether</i> or not you are entered in the Beauty Contest, you may want to participate in voting. You don't have to be entered in the contest to vote! In this section we will go over voting rules, and the different ways you may approach voting.

<h2>☞ beauty contest voting rules</h2>

<i class="point">◊</i> <b>You can only vote from your main account</b> - Like earning neopoints, and doing your dailies, voting in the beauty contest may only happen from your main account. Even if you are entered in the BC on a side account, you must log into your main account to vote.

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Buying votes is against the rules</b> - Trying to buy votes with neopoints or items is considered cheating and against the rules. People must make up their own choice about voting, you can't bribe them!</p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Vote trading isn't allowed</b> - Similar to trying to buy votes with NPs or items, you cannot promise to vote for someone if they vote for you. This is considered cheating as well. (Plus then you only have like 50 votes, and you'll need way more than that to place overall!)</p>


<h2>☞ ways to vote</h2>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Manual Voting</b> - Sometimes users will go through each species and look at every (or most) entries and pick which one they want to vote for. This is sometimes a long process, but those who are dedicated to picking the best entry will usually do this.</p>

<p>Sometimes users will make a board saying they manual voted. It's important to note that you can ask if this person voted for you, but <i>you cannot post a list of who you voted for in each species</i>. TNT is all about letting people make their own choices in voting, and this could be considered advertising for those entries. People might be more inclined to vote for them because a MVer thought they were great.</p>

<p>If you choose to MV and want to make a board topic saying that you did or are going to, just let people post and ask if you voted for them! That way you just have to say yes or no, and aren't considered advertising for them!</p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Silent Voting</b> - This is a very common practice among people who vote in the BC. Voting silently means you don't tell who you did or didn't vote for. This sort of lets you keep your votes to yourself, and (maybe) not hurt anyone's feelings along the way!</p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Non-Silent Voting</b> - You can vote non-silently if you want to tell the world who you voted for. Most commonly this is done by posting the massage that comes up after you have voted for a pet: <i>You vote has been cast for PETNAME</i>. If you post anything but that, people may question whether you really did vote or not.</p>

<p><i class="point">◊</i> <b>Voting First Come First Served</b> - When you advertise that you are voting this way, that means that you are voting for the first one of each species that comes to your board. I am personally biased against this because there may be others out there who want your vote, but didn't quite make it in time. This means you are voting on speed instead of the quality of artwork. This is a good way to quickly vote for the contestants that week, though!</p>

<center><p><i class="text2">* * *</i></p></center>

<p><i>Special Note:</i> It's important to note that however you chose to vote, that you don't <i>lie</i> to other users about voting for them. It's pretty easy to forget who you've said you voted to, and you will most likely get caught in your lie. Being honest and saying you didn't vote for someone may be hard and you may not want to hurt someone's feelings, but it's better in the long run to just tell the truth!</p>

<div class="content" align="justify">

<i class="text2">the</i> Beauty Contest has gone through several changes since its start in the early 2000s. This section is to record all the different stages of the BC so that they may not be lost to the sands of time. (cue epic instrumental music here).

<h2>☞ the very early stages of the BC</h2>

<center><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/shops/pc_toolbar.gif"><br><i>The old navigation in pet central, complete with the beauty contest button at the far right!</i></center>

<p>Now, <i>according to my research</i>, the first form of the Beauty Contest was called "Neopian Beauty Expo" and was started on <b>February 21, 2000</b>. Here is an excerpt from an old news update about it:</p>

<center><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/57XMKEg.png" border="1" width="600"><br>{{ <a href="//www.neopets.com/newfeatures/feb2000.phtml">source</a> }}
</p></center>

<p>At the time of writing this section, I don't know what the Beauty Expo consisted of, but if I do find some more information about it, I will update you here!</p>

<p>The BC was then revamped and relaunched on <b>November 27, 2000</b>. This is the news update notifying the users of the relaunch:</p>

<center><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/SoNG409.png" border="1" width="600"><br>{{ <a href="//www.neopets.com/newfeatures/nov2000.phtml">source</a> }}</p>
</center>

<p>Here are the very first winners of the Beauty Contest in all their glory:</p>

<center><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/pLGDIFj.png" border="1"></p></center>

<p>The first months of the BC had a lot more entries like this: images taken from neopets with added additions in a computer program. These are affectionately known as CAPs (Copy and Paste) to BCers now. <b>June 25, 2001</b> is the first date where artwork, not CAPs dominated the overall winners.</p>

<center><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/b8omzkR.png" border="1"></p></center>

<p>This is a really important thing to take notice of. That the contest was beginning to change form into what we think of the Beauty Contest as it is today. Although it will still take years and years for more user-drawn artwork and less CAPs to be entered, at this point we being to see a shift in the BC. Its fascinating to see that something that was the norm to do changed to become "one of the most disapproved of things for an aspiring Beauty Contestant to do." <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=254705&amp;week=254">(source)</a></p>

<h2>☞  how voting has changed</h2>

I started BCing around 2003, and actually got to witness one of the significant changes the BC has gone through. Prior to <b>2004</b> you were actually able to see how many votes your pet had <i>during the contest</i>. When I wasn't entered I love to refresh the page and see the vote count for my favorite pet go up.

<p>Now though, TNT has removed this feature and votes stay hidden until the contest in complete.</p>

<center><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LGJ7lqB.png" border="1"><br><i>Editorial inquiring about the voting change. {{ <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=254705&amp;week=618">source</a> }}</i></p></center>

<h2>☞ the save our sides campaign</h2>

Currently you can enter the BC on your side account, and when the BC first started you were allowed as well, but there was a period of time where entering your pet into the BC from an account other than your main was against the rules.

<center>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jMT9WG8.png" border="1"><br>{{ <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=235">source</a> }}</p>
</center>

The reason for the change in the rules was that the BC used to offer Item and NP prizes for placing 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, both for the overall winners and the individual pet species. Here are what the prizes used to be before <b>2008</b>:

<p></p><center>
<blockquote>
<center><b>OVERALL PRIZES</b></center><br><b>1st:</b> 20,000 NP + ONE rare item + 1 gold trophy
<br><b>2nd:</b> 10,000 NP + ONE rare item + 1 silver trophy
<br><b>3rd:</b> 5,000 NP + ONE rare item + 1 bronze trophy

<br><br><center><b>SPECIES PRIZES</b></center><br><b>1st:</b> 10,000 NP + 1 gold trophy
<br><b>2nd:</b> 5,000 NP + 1 silver trophy
<br><b>3rd:</b> 2,500 NP + 1 bronze trophy
</blockquote>
</center>


<p>The BCers were very unhappy about the new ban on side accounts. This meant that they only had 4 pets to enter, or they would have to continuously rotate pets to their main account to enter them. The artists didn't really care about the NP and Item prizes in the BC. What they loved was drawing their different pets and getting a pretty trophy to show off on their lookup for winning!</p>

<p>To protest the new rule, artists came together and participated in what was called the <i>Save Our Sides</i> (SOS) campaign. The goal of this movement was to lift the ban and allow users to enter their pets  on side accounts in the BC again. The campaign consisted of a few things. First of all, artists could add their name to a petition. The petpage that hosted the list was sent to TNT to show them how many users were against the new rule.</p>

<center><p>
<a href="http://petpages.neopets.com/~Fairy_Yuki"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/E8OYL0s.gif" style="border: 1px solid black;"></a><br><i>Former petpage of the Save Our Sides petition</i></p>
</center>

<p>BCers also sent in inquiries to the Neopian Times editorial about the new side account ban and entered art into the BC that drew attention to the. Here was my entry for a user-run theme week that promoted SOS:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VkqciA9.jpg" style="border: 1px solid black;" width="300"><br><i>I put a side account pet in a picture with one on my main so she could be in the BC too!</i></p>
</center>

<p>On <b>April 4, 2008</b>, the members of TNT changed their minds and allowed pets on side accounts to be entered in the BC again. They removed the NP and item rewards in order to make this happen. </p>

<center><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/0efwKDf.png" border="1"><br>{{ <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=641">source</a> }}</p>
</center>

<p>The Save Our Sides campaign is actually something really incredible. The artists of the website gathered together and actually made a positive change in an aspect of the website they cared about.</p>

<h2>☞ branston the eyrie </h2>

<center><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_headers/beauty.gif"><br><i>A header for the beauty contest from an old neopets layout.</i></center>

<p>Branson is the unofficial mascot for the Beauty Contest! He's the beautiful Eyrie that greets you when you go to the main page of the contest. He's also a player in the game Cheat!. Here's more information about Branston:</p>


<p><img src="//images.neopets.com/beautycontest/beauty3.gif" class="picture_left" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 7px; padding: 5px;"><b>Name:</b> Branston
<br><b>Species:</b> Eyrie (naturally)
<br><b>Age:</b> He loves himself way too much to say
<br><b>Occupation:</b> Lord of the Dance Floor
<br><b>Hobby:</b> Strutting his stuff in front of mirrors and polishing his extensive gold medallion collection
<br><b>Quote:</b>Neopoints and good looks aren't everything, but fortunately they're all I've got..." 
</p>

<p>❝Thinking that all eyes are always on him, Branston the Eyrie is the one and only self-obsessed, egotistical Lord of the Dance Floor. Just about every night and day he throws gigantic parties in his very own honour at his plush Neohome, which always leads to a huge circle of swooning pets surrounding him while he dances away on his custom made gleaming gold dance floor.❞ - Read more about Branston on his <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=8">Neopedia article.</a></p>

<h2>☞  the bc as we know it</h2>

Although the BC tends to stay relatively the same, there was one big update to the BC trophies in <b>September 2013</b>. I think these trophies look much better compared to the old ones!

<center><p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/KKa6BUi.png" border="1"><br>{{ <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2013-09-09">source</a> }}</p></center>

<p>Wondering what the old trophies looked like? Here are the old trophies that looked this way up until 2013. They definitely needed an update!</p>

<center>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/b0TvytF.gif" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 7px; padding: 5px;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VkRt9da.gif" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 7px; padding: 5px;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Rv2qh9w.gif" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 7px; padding: 5px;"><br><i>Ewwww.... old trophies!</i></p>
</center>

<p>More recently, the BC has waned in popularity compared to past years. This can probably be attributed to a couple of things:</p>

<p>For a while, Neopets had a huge proplem where the site lagged when pages loaded. A lot of users chose not to engage with the site then, and the BC also saw a decrease in entries. Another reason is that TNT started to enforce the rule that you couldn't advertise on boards other than the Art Chat, Spotlight, and Premium Boards. Users tend to want to multi-task and it's hart to advertise your pets UFT, when you have to constantly change your siggy! People might have then chosen to not even bother entering. TNT also got our hopes up with a shiny new BC avatar in <b>November 2014</b>. The avatar, unfortunately isn't activated and users can't achieve it. Maybe once this avatar is fixed, more people will try the BC!</p>

<p></p><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/beautycontest.gif"></center>

<p>Until then, the BC is quiet, sometimes having few entries in each category. I hope that one day it can be a thriving spotlight opportunity for most people!</p>



<h2>☞  a history of the crystal cave bc guide</h2>

It was popular for a time for BCers to band together and form different groups that hung out together on the (what was then known as) BC boards. One group that I was a part of was called <i>The BC Jedi and Sith</i>. This group of BCers wanted to protect the BC from art thieves as well as upload the rules of the BC board. 

<p>Let's be real, this was probably hugely cliquey and annoying to people, but it did serve as inspiration for the first incarnation of this BC Guide.</p>

<p>The name for the Crystal Cave came from the Lightsabers adoptables that I made for the other members of this group. I imagine Osa's cave as the place where people could come and get the crystals that powered their Lightsabers. My Kau is the guardian of these precious crystals and thus, the Crystal Cave BC Guide was born!</p>

Unless the image URL says <i>//images.neopets.com</i> it is NOT draw by an artist at Neopets. This means you can't use it.</p>

</center></td>
</tr></table></center>

<p><i class="point">❄</i> <b>You may not edit the image you found on the search engine</b> - If you put that image you found onto MS Paint, Photoshop, GIMP or some other photo editor and you change the colors, add wings, a colored background etc. <i>it does not mean it is your own artwork</i>. You didn't draw the base image you just edited, so its not 100% made by you!</p>

<p><i class="point">❄</i> <b>You may not heavily reference or trace the art</b> - If someone can identify the image you drew from, it is still NOT considered your art. You didn't come up with the concept, style, or pose--the original artist did. </p>

<center><p><i class="text2">* * *</i></p>
</center>

<p>If you were removed form the BC for Art Theft, you will receive two things form TNT: </p>

<p>One is a <b>neomail</b> informing you that you have been removed from the contest (it looks a little different than the one in the last section). This neomail is sent by the <i>Contest_Judge</i>.</p> 

<center><p>
<img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v212/antonia22301/osa/guide/guide_theft_removalNM.png" width="600" border="1"><br><i>Rejection neomail for art theft (among other things).<br>(Drag to address bar for full view)</i></p>
</center>

<p>The second thing you will receive if you have used someone else's art for your entry is a <b>warning</b>. Yes, that's right. Art theft is against the rules on Neopets, and you will receive an official warning to your account (&amp; can be frozen if you continue to steal art). Please note that the warning does not come from the Contest_Judge account, but instead from the official <i>thenopetsteam</i> account.</p>

<center><p>
<img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v212/antonia22301/osa/guide/guide_theft_warning.png" width="600" border="1"><br><i>This is the warning you will receive if you are removed for art theft<br>(Drag to address bar for full view)</i></p>
</center>


<center><p><i class="text2">* * *</i></p></center>

<p>Since you've gotten a warning from TNT, you maybe freaking out because didn't realize what you were doing, and the implications of it. If you were unaware of the rule regarding art theft, here are a few of the places on Neopets, where it the rule is mentioned.</p>

When <b>linking with an image</b> you need to have your picture uploaded somewhere on the internet.</p>


<center>
<blockquote>
<b>*</b> an image-hosting site (Photobucket)<br><b>*</b> use Neopet's temp. image URL
</blockquote>
</center>
<p>

I'm going to teach you how to create your image-hyperlink using Neo's temporary image URL! When you upload your BC entry to neopets, it is uploaded somewhere on their servers. So, your image is on the internet (instead of just your computer). This image URL is only <i>temporary</i> for the week that you are in the contest! (However, if you place, your picture is on the site permanently!)</p>

<p><i class="point">❄</i> <b>Where do I find my Neopets temporary image URL?</b> - The best way to find your temporary neopets URL is to go to your pet's entry page where you can see your full image. Drag that image to the address bar of your browser and the URL there is the image URL you can use to put your image on a petpage!</p>

<div class="pucontent">

When on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=13">Art Chat</a> advertising your entry, the easiest thing to do is alter your NeoSignature or NeoHTML to include your BC Entry URL.<p>

</p><center>
<img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v212/antonia22301/osa/guide/guide_neohtml.png" border="1" width="600"><br><i>(drag to address bar for full view)</i>
</center>


<p>This is an example on how you can set up your neoHTML for the BC. How do you do this?</p>
<p>

<b>1.</b> Go to your Board <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/preferences.phtml">Preferences</a>.</p>
<p>

<b>2.</b> Scroll down to where it says "NeoHTML/Signature".</p>
<p>

<b>3.</b> You can keep your neoHTML the same, and simply put your BC Entry in your neoSignature. If you'd like, you can also include something to ask people to vote: <i>Please spare a vote?</i>, <i>Vote?</i>, or <i>Vote for my [species name]?</i>.</p>
<p>

There are two ways you can link to your entry:</p>
<p>


</p><center><blockquote>
<b>*</b> A direct link to your entry<br><b>*</b> Link to your pet's webpage, which has a link to the pet's entry on it

</blockquote></center>
<p>

There are certain pros and cons to each of these options. If you <b>A)</b> <i>link directly to your BC Entry Page</i> you are streamlining the number of clicks someone has to do to vote for your entry (good for those lazy voters!). However, it takes up more room in your neoSignature and you are only showing the BC-quality picture.</p>
<p>

Option <b>B)</b>, <i>putting a petpage URL in your font</i> has the advantage of being a shorter link, and can be all inclusive: if you enter more than one pet into the BC from the same account, you can but both entries on ONE page--2 or 3 links are sometimes hard to fit into neoHTML. You can also show them a higher-quality or non-cropped version of your entry before they get to the BC page. The con is: more clicks to get to the vote bottom, which could reduce the amount of people that actually vote. </p>
<p>

<b>Remember: in neoHTML you don't need a code to create a link!</b> Simply paste the URL into your neoHTML/signature or post and neo will automatically make it a link when you post! Cool, huh?!</p>

<p><i class="point">❄</i> <i class="obold">Reserved</i> » Osa prefers to keep to herself. This is probably why she enjoys her cave up in the mountaintop so much. Being alone gives her time to think and process and recharge her energy. Being around people or other living things makes her tired, so even when she's around them she most likely won't say much. She opens up to her PetPet, Tarn, sometimes, but even Osa can tire of him eventually.</p>

<p><i class="point">❄</i> <i class="obold">Loyal</i> » Although she may come off as quiet and hard, Osa actually cares very deeply about those that have earned her trust. She will actively work to protect those that she loves and trusts. That trust must be earned from her--it's not automatically given. </p>

<p><i class="point">❄</i> <i class="obold">Hardworking</i> » Osa will work extremely hard in order to complete a task that is asked of her (by someone she is loyal to of course!). She won't stop until she feels that her task is completed. She wants to make sure everything goes according to plan. (<i>Her</i> plan, that is). She doesn't like to stray from what was asked, or how she perceives things going in her head. This will really make her angry!</p>

<p><i class="point">❄</i> <i class="obold">Distant</i> » Osa is not someone who examines her feelings very often, nor does she understand the feelings of others. She will become extremely uncomfortable if someone cries or shows emotional passion in front of her. To her, facts and logic are how one should be making decisions. She won't admit it, but she thinks lesser of those that trust their heart over knowledge. These attributes may have others think that she is distant or has a cold heart.</p>

<p><i class="point">❄</i> <i class="obold">Explosive</i> » Although Osa is generally reserved, distant, and quiet, there are moments where she may "explode" with feelings of frustration or anger. These mostly come out when things don't go as she had planned. In this state, Osa may lash out verbally or physically, so you definitely don't want to be caught in the crossfire!</p>

<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zD6QrjY.png" width="700" style="border: 1px solid #2c2c2c;"></center>

<p>Osa's build is extremely large, athletic, and muscular. She stands twice as large as a horse, giving her the physical size to be able to carry an adult human on her back and maintain flight. She has deep red scales that cover most of her body. They will sometimes catch the sun, or reflection of the snow and give off a bright red shine. She also has smoother, sleeker scales that cover the underside of her neck and stomach. These ash grey scales aren't quite as hard as her top, red scales. While they would provide protection to most human-made weapons, this is a known weak spot of the Dragon Kau's when they are fighting each other. Her large tail is build more for balance while on the ground than use as a weapon. Along her back she has deep gold spikes that provide extra protection from above. (continue)</p>

<h5>more about dragon kaus</h5>

<i class="text2">O</i>sa is part of a species of Kau's known as the Dragon Kaus. This species evolved around the rocky plateaus of Tyrannia. Neopians needed easier ways to get around and bred Kau's with favorable attributes to do so. 

<p>The human Neopians that lived in Tyrannia used them for various tasks around the villages in the plateaus. The most largest and most athletic were used for hunting, or into battle when the need was there. The slimmer and lighter weight ones were used for traveling to nearby villages for trade and commerce. Other Dragon Kaus were used to lift heavy objects or help with infrastructure.</p>

<p>Although the Dragon Kaus were bred in captivity to do the human's bidding, some of them did escape to surrounding areas, such as the caves in the mountains. These Kau's grew up wild and away from human services, so they were able to thrive as their own species. Different families or tribes of the Dragon Kaus eventually were established (known as "herds"). </p>
