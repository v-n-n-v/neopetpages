WHAT IS THERE TO DO ON NEOPETS?
  </div>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome to my ABCs guide about things to do on Neopets! I got the idea from seeing topics cropping up on the neoboards asking for ideas for stuff to do on the site. Much of the time it's new players who ask, but it's not uncommon to see returning players and long time players ask for suggestions as well. The key point is that there are many, many things to do in Neopia. This guide is not intended to be all-inclusive, but it is reasonably comprehensive. Visit Jellyneo for more in-depth guides for specific features, games, events, etc. <b><i>Regarding navigation, please note that letters after C continue in the left and then right sidebars.</i></b><br><br></p>


  <div class="column">
<h2><span style="background-color: #E0F6FF;">A is for Avatars</span></h2>
Avatar collecting is a favorite pastime for many players, old and new! It's fun and challenging to earn secret avatars. Many are easy to obtain. However, a lot of avatars require time, dedication, or perhaps a ton of neopoints to earn them. If you make the high score list you can also earn a trophy. 
  </div>

  <div class="column" id="middle">
<h2><span style="background-color: #E0F6FF;">B is for Battledome</span></h2>
Train a pet for the Battledome! (Guide <a href="/~SilverCyanide4">1</a>, <a href="/~Nootrishus">2</a>). There are many reasons why it's worth the effort to train a pet. For starters, if a plot should come along and it  features a BD component then you'll want a trained pet to be able to earn plot points.  Another reason is that you can earn NP and prizes from daily battles, plus win boons by participating in the biweekly skirmishes.
  </div>

  <div class="column">
<h2><span style="background-color: #E0F6FF;">C is for Coding</span></h2>
Learn HTML and CSS in order to edit your user lookup, pet lookups, shops and galleries, and pet pages. Not only is it fun to be able to code these areas on the site, but it is an actual real life competency that you can use at work or at home. Honestly, if it hadn't been for the opportunity to learn to code on Neopets I doubt I would ever have tried it.<br></div>

 
<h1>Stay Informed</h1>
<p><b>NEW PLOT!!!</b> Visit <a href="http://neopets.com/tvw/">this link</a> to participate in <b>The Void Within</b> plot. Also be sure to otherwise Keep up to Date about current happenings. Read the <a href="/nf.phtml">New Features</a> regularly so you are aware of event announcements, new items, new pet colours, contest results, etc. Also, it's a good idea to read the weekly Editorial in <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml">The Neopian Times</a> for answers to user questions by TNT staff members.<br><br> Keep reading for more things to do.<br><br></p>


  <div class="column">
<h2>Site Events</h2>
Watch for announcements for site events and plots and take part! Examples include annual events such as the Advent Calendar, Altador Cup, Negg Festival, Faerie Quest event, etc. Plots are less frequent but they are a lot of fun when they happen.
  </div>
  <div class="column" id="middle">
<h2>Neoquest I and II</h2>
Do you crave adventure and excitement? Have some time on your hands? Try tackling <a href="/games/neoquest/neoquest.phtml">Neoquest I</a> and <a href="/games/nq2/index.phtml">Neoquest II</a>! JN has good guides, including related maps. Earn avatars and trophies while you play.
  </div>
  <div class="column">
<h2>Charity Corner</h2>
Charity Corner has become a highly anticipated event on Neopets. Many players hoard items in their SDB (especially r90-99) to donate during the event. In return you can win rare items or perks (note: the rewards system has changed over the years). 
  </div>

  <div class="column">
<h2>Gourmet Club</h2>
Feed your pet gourmet foods (r90-99) and have a chance at another trophy! Once you get to a certain point it gets quite expensive to acquire the foods. Getting on the <a href="/gourmet_club.phtml">HST</a> is an accomplishment!
  </div>
  <div class="column" id="middle">
<h2>Pet Trading</h2>
The Pound Chat is where it's at if you are interested in pet trading. You will quickly notice that unconverted (UC) pet trading is especially active. Here is a <a href="/~Erizolen">basic guide.</a> Check out shuffles on the PC as well.
  </div>
  <div class="column">
<h2>Neocash Trading</h2>
Do you have Neocash (NC) items that you don't need and would like to trade for something else? Then NC trading may be the answer. Visit <a href="/~Neocash">The Neocash Hub</a> for basic information, NC values, lingo, and other help. You can also find NC shuffles on the NC neoboard.
  </div>

  <div class="column">
<h2>Art and Design</h2>
Are you the artistic type? Love to draw and paint? Create artful layouts? Submit your artistic creations to the <a href="/art/gallery.phtml">Art Gallery</a> or the <a href="/beauty/index.phtml">Beauty Contest</a>, or enter one of the <a href="/contests.phtml">site spotlights</a>.
  </div>


  <div class="column" id="middle">
<h2>Neoboards</h2>
Like to chat? Have a question? Want to show off your latest avatar? Then spend some time on the <a href="/neoboards/index.phtml">Neoboards</a>. Be sure to stay on topic and follow the chat rules. Set <a href="/neoboards/preferences.phtml">preferences</a> here.
  </div>

  <div class="column">
<h2>Pet Adoptions</h2>
Many players enjoy surfing <a href="/pound/">the pound</a> in search of pets to adopt. Often they will zap the pet until it is painted a nice colour and then return it to the pound or adopt it out. Another pastime in the pound is looking for <a href="/~grimwar">stuck pets</a>.
  </div>

  <div class="column">
<h2>Stamp Album</h2>
<a href="/stamps.phtml?type=album&amp;page_id=0">Stamp collecting</a> is a challenging and expensive hobby, but can be quite rewarding as well. Currently there are 23 stamp album related avatars available, and you can also earn a trophy! Collect stamps, charms, evil coconuts, coins, sea shells, and scarabs.
  </div>

  <div class="column" id="middle">
<h2>Plushie Tycoon</h2>
Ever want to be a tycoon? In Neopia you can become one by playing <a href="/games/tycoon/index.phtml">Plushie Tycoon</a>! Each month a new competition begins, so it is best to begin on the first of the month. Be sure to visit the current Plushie Tycoon help board in the Games forum for helpful guides and support.  
  </div>

    <div class="column">
<h2>Neodeck</h2>
Start a card collection and put them in your <a href="/games/neodeck/index.phtml">Neodeck</a>. Collectable cards restock at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=8">card shop</a>. You can remove these cards from your neodeck at any time if you decide you want to sell them later (unlike stamps). If you collect enough cards to get on the high score table you may be eligible for a <a href="/gamescores.phtml?game_id=1329">trophy</a>! 

</div>

  <div class="column">
<h2>Rubbish Dump</h2>
The <a href="/medieval/rubbishdump.phtml">Rubbish Dump</a> in Meridell was recently optimized (April 2022). If you are both lucky and persistent at refreshing in the dump, you may be able to score the Rubbish avatar, and possibly a rare item in the process! The Rubbish avatar can be awarded by obtaining either a petpet, fading bottled faerie, paint brush, apple core, Everlasting Apple, or dung catapult.

  </div>
  <div class="column" id="middle">
<h2>Almost Abandoned Attic</h2>
Another loyalty perk, the <a href="/halloween/garage.phtml"> Almost Abandoned Attic</a> is accessible ONLY to accounts 36 months and older. The Attic is located in Neovia and specializes in stocking r80-99 items. There is a chance of restocking at 7 minute intervals. Be really FAST, because the Items can sell out quite quickly. Also, there is a limit of restocking 5 items per day.
  </div>

  <div class="column">
<h2>Gallery</h2>
Start a <a href="/gallery/index.phtml">Gallery</a>! Many Neopians have collections of items that they display in nicely decorated galleries. What will it be: plushies, neggs, rainbow items, faerie items, gnomes, or something else? There are tons of items to collect. Galleries can provide a great sense of accomplishment. You could even submit your gallery into the <a href="/spotlight_subs/gallery_submission.phtml">gallery spotlight</a>.<br><br></div>

 <div class="column">
<h2>Quest Log</h2>
<a href="/questlog/">Quest Log</a> was launched as a new feature on Oct. 24, 2023! Complete the five random daily quests to win prizes (NP &amp; items). After seven consecutive days of completing these quests, you will be rewarded with a grand prize. It will then reset for a new week.
  </div>
 
 <div class="column" id="middle">
<h2>Monthly AMAs</h2>
Check out the monthly AMAs where TNT staffers discuss current and future happenings connected to World of Neopia, and also answer questions submitted by players. Be sure to watch for appearances by TNT Dom, the CEO.
  </div>

   <div class="column">
<h2>Jordle</h2>
