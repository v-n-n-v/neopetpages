<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">There are now two ways to lend   transfer pets 
from one account to the other.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>Safe Transfer:</b>  Each account 
		can make one outgoing transfer, and accept one incoming transfer per 
		month.  Each pet can be transferred once per day.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>Manual Transfer:  </b>If you 
		have no transfers left for the month, the only other way to lend or 
		transfer pets or aged petpets (while 
attached to a pet) is 
through the pound.   This requires the person pounding the pet to 
abandon the pet in the pound, and the person catching the pet to be there to 
get the pet out of the pound before it is snatched away by another user.  Once 
		a pet is in the pound, it is free game.  It is a risky thing to do.  There is no 
way to 100% guarantee that the pet will go to the right person, but there are 
		things you can do to minimize the risk of losing the pet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">For a successful transfer, it is very important 
that both people involved have good, strong communication, understand what they 
are doing, and will be there to follow through and catch (or return) the pet.  
If one person makes a mistake or is interrupted, the pet will probably be lost.  
It's important to understand that before deciding to lend or borrow.  It is 
a serious commitment from the second you discuss the pounding of a pet, until it 
is safely returned to its owner.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Please also keep in mind that 'tipping' of 
      any kind is against the rules.  It is against the rules to lend your 
      pets or items in return for ANY form of compensation.  People have 
      and will get suspended and/or frozen for doing this.</font></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>Safe Transfer:</b>  The new safe 
transfer feature that has been provided by neopets.  The only way to 
transfer a pet from one account to another without putting it in the pound.  
Preferred, but limited to once per month. </font></p>

<i><font size="2">I know this seems obvious, but it gets confused so very often:<br></font></i><b><font size="2">Lender:</font></b><font size="2"> The person who owns the pet that you want to 

borrow.  If you are the one who owns a pet, you will LEND the pet.<br><b>Borrower:</b> The person who wants to borrow a pet from the Lender.  This person will BORROW the pet.<br><br><b>References:</b> Names of people with whom you have transferred 
(borrowed or lent) pets to or from in the past. This tells a lender two things:<br>
1) If the borrower is trustworthy, and will honestly attempt to return the pet.<br>
2) If the borrower knows what they are doing and is quick and reliable at 
transferring pets, and can be counted on to catch the pet QUICKLY once it hits 
the pound.<br><br><b>PLA References:</b> Same as references, but must be people who 
frequently lend and borrow on the PLA boards, and whose name the lender will 
most likely recognize. Some lenders (myself included) are more inclined to trust 
the word of someone that they have seen lending/borrowing in the past.<br><br><b>Pounding:</b> To leave a pet in the pound.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>Catching:</b> To receive a pet from the pound - to 'catch' the pet 
out of the pound before someone else has the chance to adopt it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>Catch Back:</b>  To pound &amp; 
      then retrieve a pet from the pound when the "catcher" fails to adopt the 
      pet quickly.  In otherwords, to save your pet by grabbing it back.

      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>AAers (Auto Adopters) - Also known 
      as Auto Sitters:</b>  
      The pet lender's mortal enemy.  Cheaters make programs that lurk in 
      the pound and adopt up painted or LE pets at super-human speeds.  
      It's sad because these accounts are usually frozen (with good cause, 
      because it is cheating and against the rules), but the pets get frozen 
      with the account.  :(     But do not fear:  
      The auto-adopters usually need your pet's name in order to 'hunt' it.   
      See the AA section in the 'If you are considering lending' for tips on how 
      to keep the AAers off your pet's tail.  <b><i>New:</i>  </b><i>I 
      also recommend visiting <b>
      <a href="http://petpages.neopets.com/~Macky">Macky's 
      Petpage</a></b> for information on how to keep these vile programs AWAY 
      from your pet.  :)</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>Pound Sitter: </b> A user 
      who spends time refreshing at the pound looking for rare pets.  These 
      are a lesser enemy to a pet lender.  They are doing nothing wrong and 
      are not breaking any rules, but they make a lender's life harder - many 
      pets have been lost to pound sitters.   It's a case of good luck 
      for the pound sitter, bad luck for the pet lender.  Pound sitters 
      should not be harassed for adopting  pets, it is well within anyone's 
      right to adopt any pet that is in the pound for any length of time.</font></p>
      <p><b><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Painted Pet</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>:
      </b> A pet that is any other colour besides the standard colours it 
      comes in (red, yellow, blue and green would all be unpainted pets.  
      brown, white &amp; purple are standard/unpainted colours for Grundos ONLY).  
      It doesn't matter how the pet became that color, painted, zapped, etc...  
      this is basically a shortcut to saying any non-standard coloured pet that 
      makes it rare and more likely to be grabbed from the pound.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>LE Pet (Limted Edition Pet):</b>  
      Any pet that cannot be created on most days.  These include pets that 
      need to be hatched or made from a certain item or potion, or are available 
      on certain days only.  These pets are rare no matter what color they 
      are, and are more likely to be grabbed from the pound.  LE pets 
      include:  Krawk, Draik, Cybunny, Poogle, Koi, Chomby, Kiko, Jetsam, 
      Tonu, Hissi and Lutari.(Technically, Krawks are called 'restricted', but yeah same thing, okay?) </font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>Lending "For Free":  </b>Technically, all lends are "free" in regards to neopoints, since it is against Neo T&amp;C to buy or sell pets, or to request any compensation or "tips" for any kind of lend.  Usually with Pet Lending, lending for free means to lend for nothing in return.  Sometimes lenders will only lend to people who will lend them a different pet in return.  There is still no exchange of neopoints or items in these transactions.

		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The new safe transfer option allows for

		</p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The safe transfer option can be accessed

		Or by using this direct link:

		//www.neopets.com/pound/transfer.phtml</a></font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Once you are at the transfer link, you 
		will see all of your pets with a "Transfer" button beneath them.<br>
		Click Transfer.<br>
		Depending on your browser, you may get a notice at the top of the window 
		that says<i>This website is using a scripted window to ask you for 
		information.  If you trust this website, click here to allow 
		scripted windows.</i><br>
		Click the error message, and choose "Temporarily Allow Scripted Windows<br>
		Click the Transfer button again, and enter the name of the person you

		paste works best.  Verify the copy   paste first by pasting it into 
		a search window and making sure it goes to their lookup.</i></font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Once you click OK on the pop-up, the pet 
		will be on their way, there is no 'last chance' confirmation.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">You will then get a message telling <i>
		*** has not yet accepted the transfer.<br></i>The user has three days to accept the transfer.  If they do not 
		accept, the pet is returned to you, and that will count as your monthly 
		outgoing transfer.  The 1000NP fee is not refunded.<i><br></i>You will get an event icon once the transfer is complete.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Each account has one incoming transfer,

		This is a calendar month, so your transfers will be reset on the first 
		of the next month - not 30 days.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Each pet can only be transferred once 
		per day, so all lends via safe transfer will be overnight lends.</font></p>

		THEN multiply)</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">All "Non-Restricted" clothing that the 
		pet is wearing will be transferred with the pet to the new owner.  
		"Restricted" Items that will not be transferred are:  NC Items, 
		No-Trade Items, and Battledome items.  Any "restricted items" that 
		the neopet is wearing or equipped with will be returned to the sender's 
		inventory.  These should be returned back to the pounder's 
		inventory, but this has been glitchy and items have been lost.  To 
		be safe, it is best to remove all weapons and restricted clothing from 
		the pet first.  </font></p>

There are 5 buttons that you must push before the pet will actually be pounded.  <br><br>
Note: There used to be specific sequence of sayings on the buttons, but now it appears that they are completely random.  Also, if you refresh on the page, it does not "start the clicks over" ~ meaning that if you have already clicked 4 times, you will only need to click one more time to abandon the pet. <br><br> It is best if you do not click at all ahead of time, and instead click all 5 times quickly when you are ready to pound.

<hr><p><font face="Tahoma" size="5"><b><a name="HOW_TO_TRANSFER">How to 
		Pound-Transfer Between Two People</a></b></font><br></p>



<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">There are two roles when transferring a pet: 
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Pounding - the person the pet is being 
		transferred FROM - and will be abandoning the pet at the pound.<br>
		Catching - the person the pet is being transferred TO - and will be 
		adopting the pet from the pound.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The main point is to make sure that 
		catcher is at the pound searching at the exact moment that the pounder 
		abandons the pet.<br>
		There are two main ways to do this:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>Neomail/Time Transfer</b><br>
The Pounder and Catcher are in contact through neomail.<br>
The Pounder will send the quick link to a catcher, and then they will set a time 
(by NST, using the clock in the sidebar).  The time should always include 
hours, minutes and seconds.  for example:  12:23:04 pm NST=12:23 and 4 seconds PM, according to the clock in the sidebar 

(not on your own 
time zone, or any other clock).   This time is usually one to two 
minutes away - in order to allow both people involved to get their links set up, 
but soon enough that you know the person isn't going to forget, or get 
interrupted somehow before the time of the transfer arrives.  The catcher should start refreshing at the search link about 10 seconds before this time.  The 
		pounder should click the last button for pounding exactly at this time.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>Messenger (strongly recommended if 
		possible)
</b><i>note ~ you cannot exchange contact information ON-SITE or through neomail, 
		so this method is only available for those whom you have another means 
		of contacting</i><b><br></b>The pounder and catcher are in contact through a messenger where they can instantly send each other messages.  The most common 
approach is for them to communicate through the process of getting set up, and 
once both parties are ready, the Pounder will start a countdown.  Usually 
3-2-1-GO. The catcher should be refreshing as the countdown begins.  The 
		Pounder should be pounding immediately after "GO".</font></p>
		<font face="verdana, arial" size="2">

		Pound-Transfer to your own side-account</a></b></font></p>
		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Two browsers are needed, such as firefox

		<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">First get the catching browser all set 
		up at the search page, double check the pet name is correct, and be

<a href="http://petpages.neopets.com/~Blue_and_fuzzy_Jub">here</a>)</i><br>
 When you are lending, have 3 windows open: <br> One window open to the pound to 
abandon. <br> One window open to the 

pet's lookup (where you can see who the owner is)<br>One window open with the 
search page entered and ready to refresh<br>
After pounding, quickly refresh the pet's lookup.  If the pet is still in the pound after 2 quick refreshes, quickly 

switch to the window with the search page and refresh to 'grab back' your pet.
It's a good idea for borrowers to do the same when returning.</font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana, arial" size="2"><b>Be sure the Catcher is Able 
      to Catch &amp; Return</b> - Confirm before pounding that the person 
      catching the pet has all the qualifications needed.  Personally, I 
      require a checklist to be confirmed before I will even begin talking about 
      the pounding times and such.  My checklist:</font></p>

that applies to everyone here. The full copy of the PLA rules current as of 08/16/06 to the best of my knowledge (if 

needed by any boardmaker) are listed waaayyy down at the bottom of the page  :)</i><br><br>- NEVER tell ANYONE you are borrowing, or post the name of the pet or the account it lives in due to Auto Adopters 

(AAers). Simply saying, "good lend to *username*" or "thank you *username* for the lend" is fine. <br><br>
- DO NOT zap or rename any pet/petpet that is loaned to you!<br><br>
- NEVER send the pet to someone else.<br><br>
- Be prepared to return the pet immediately. Make sure you haven't already pounded today &amp; have time to re-pound.<br><br>- Please be courteous &amp; read a potential lender's OWN rules before contacting them. If they have rules, there is a 

reason for it.<br><br>
- Make sure you know exactly how to get the avatar you are seeking BEFORE the transfer (have the link to the Draik Nest 

ready or have your food already purchased, etc).<br><br>
- Please make an effort to be kind. Remember that it costs lenders time and NP to let people borrow their pets, and they go out of their way to help those who need avatars.  <br><br>- Lenders deserve to see you at your best just like everyone else. Please don't forget your <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Cultured">neo-netiquette*</a> at the first sign that you may be getting a 'free' avatar. *Thanks Lauzi for the awesome guide ;)<br><br>
- Please communicate clearly and in an intelligent manner. Communication is important throughout the process. Asking 

"plese cn i brrow ur pet" is not going to get you anywhere. <br><br>
- Do not refer borrowers to the lenders, unless the lender says it is okay to do so.<br><br>
- If you utilize the Pin Option to protect your pets, don't forget to REMOVE it before beginning a transfer.</font></p>

<a name="IF_YOU_ARE_CONSIDERING_BORROWING:">If You are Considering Borrowing:</a></font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><br><br>
Please take time to familiarize yourself with the process before neomailing 
anyone. Lenders may not mind walking you through it, but it will be a better and 
safer transfer if you fully understand what you are doing before you begin.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Please understand that Lenders are putting 
      their pets on the line out of pure kindness.  They get nothing aout of the lend except for the joy of helping 

someone else.   Please be respectful of 
      lenders and their decisions, even if their decision is that they don't feel comfortable lending to you.  If this 

is the case, don't be offended, and don't demean yourself by begging.  A better approach would be to find out exactly 

what is keeping them back, and fix that if you can.  (practice and build up references by borrowing some easier and less 

expensive pets - like the petpets) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">If/when you do find a lender, please be 
      very careful of their pet and make sure you are able to fulfill the 
      commitment of completing the transfer.  Do not attempt to borrow a 
      pet while you are distracted, may have to leave soon, may be interrupted, 
      or when your computer is having problems.  It is very important that 
      nothing will prevent you from being at the pound at the time you are 
      supposed to.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">When you borrow a pet, it is a good idea 
      to ask the lender if you can acknowledge them and use them as a reference, 
      or if they would rather remain anonymous.  <br></font></p>
<hr><p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">
<br></font><b><a name="IF_YOU_ARE_CONSIDERING_LENDING:">
<font face="Tahoma" size="5">
If You are Considering Lending</font></a></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><br><br>
- Do not lend any pets that are dear to you because you feel you have to pay 
back your lenders. Lenders are all aware of the risk of losing a pet, and have 
probably lost at least one pet themselves. No one should EVER ask to borrow a 
pet that is not for lend, because plain and simple: pets DO get lost despite our 
best efforts. The only way to keep a pet 100% safe is to keep it on your account 
for good. :)<br><br>
- Keep your lending pets on spare accounts, and keep the names of your pets, and 
spare accounts secret. Never post on the lending boards from a spare account 
that contains a pet you will be lending. If you decide to lend a pet that is on 
your main, move it to a spare before posting. Do not ever post the pet names. Do 
not put links to your spare accounts, or mention your spare account names in 
your user lookup. Auto Adopters do their 'homework' to gather pet names to add 
to their auto adopt bots, but *most* of the time, they need your pets name - if 
get it, your pet may as well have a big red target on its back.<br><br>
- DO check references.  If someone is willing to lie about their intent to return your pet, why wouldn't they lie about 

their references?  It's quite easy to look at the boards and see who is lending what and just add their name to your 

references.
<br><br>
- DO give honest feedback when others come to you to check a reference.  It feels horrible to give a bad reference, I 

hate doing it.  But wouldn't it feel even more horrible if you had an 'iffy' lend with someone and gave them a good 

reference anyway, then that person lost someone's krawk?  
<br><br></font></p>
<hr><p><b><a name="OTHER_TIPS,_TRICKS_AND_IDEAS"><font face="Tahoma" size="5">Other 
Tips, Tricks and Ideas for Lenders</font></a></b></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Stay organized!  I have a notepad 
      file with all my quick adopt links, which pets are on which accounts, my 
      standard posts that I use for PLA, and other paragraphs of 
      instructions/information that i copy/paste during the transfer.  This 
      helps me immensely.   I also maintain a petpage showing everyone 
      to whom I have lent, and honest notes about the transfer.  I need to keep this online b/c I don't always play from the same computer.<br><br>If you have a petpage attached to a pet, make sure you copy/paste it in a text file and store it before transferring the pet, as petpages ARE cleared when the pet hits the pound. 
<br><br>
If you've been zapping the petpet, make sure it's not a pile of soot.  You can't pound a pet while the pile of soot is 

attached.  Any other petpet (zapped or not) WILL stay the same in transfer (in the zapped form as long as it is not 

removed).
<br><br>
If you're going to age any petpets for lending, go look in the pound for a badly named, unpainted pet to adopt and age 

the petpet on.  This will make transfers a LOT easier.  Don't lend your faerie yurble with a harris attached to get 

someone else the harris avatar.  That's just silly  :P<br><br>  
If you are doing a time transfer, keep in mind that neoclocks sometimes get off 
		by a few seconds. Make sure that when you're catching you are at the 
		search page refreshing at least 10 seconds early.

		When someone legitimately finds a pet in the pound  while 
      someone is transferring, they are completely within their rights to adopt 
      the pet.   While it is unfortunate for the people who lose the 
      pet, please understand that once the pet is in the pound, it is 
      'technically' public property and anyone can adopt it.  If someone is 
      lucky enough to stumble upon a werelupe during the 0.5 seconds it is in 
      the pound, you can not hold it against them for taking the opportunity to 
      adopt it... wouldn't you?   Some players are very nice and will 
      return the pet if you explain your situation, but they are in no way 
      obligated to do that.  One or two polite messages to the owner asking 
      nicely and maturely is appropriate - and if they do return your pet, your 
      profuse thank you's and adoration are due.  Harassing them, telling 
      other people to neomail them, or accusing them of stealing your pet is not 
      appropriate, and can actually cause you to end up with a warning if they 
		report you.  It's against the rules, is just not nice, and they did nothing wrong.  
      If they decide not to give back the pet, that is their choice and 
      shouldn't be despised for it.</font>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Now, AAers, we can despise all we want!  
      As long as you're fairly certain that's what it is feel free to report it 
      to TNT.  However, don't harass them because then you'll be breaking 
      the rules and putting your own account at risk!</font></p>

Standard Title:<br>  *star* Pet Lenders Anonymous *star* <br><br>
---------------------<br>
	PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING!<br><br>
	Pet Transferring &amp; Lending Guide:<br>
	//www.neopets.com/~bangkokk<br><br>
	You may either post which pets you are lending/borrowing or browse through 
	the board &amp; neomail others who have posted.<br>
	Please indicate whether you're looking for Safe Transfers or Pound Transfers.<p>---------------------<br><br>
	Lending/Borrowing Etiquette:<br><br>
	1. NEVER post the name of the pet or the account it lives in due to AAers. 
	Simply saying "thank you *username* for the lend of *pet type*" is fine. <br><br>
	2. DO NOT zap or rename any borrowed pet/petpet. For pets that you need to 
	feed for the avatar, do not bloat them or put them in the neolodge.</p>
	<p>-----------</p>
	<p>3. NEVER send the pet to someone else unless instructed by the lender. We can easily see that you have done it &amp; you will end up on the 'black' list here. <br><br>
	4. Please be courteous &amp; read a potential lender's OWN rules before contacting them. If they have rules, there is a reason for it.</p>
	<p>-------------</p>
	<p>5. RETURN THE PET ON TIME. For pound transfers be prepared to return 
	immediately -  make sure you haven't already pounded today &amp; have time to re-pound.  
	All Safe-Transfer lends will be over-night, as each pet can only be 
	transfered once per day.  Make sure you are here to return the pet the 
	next day.<br><br>
-------------<br><br>
6. The QAL no longer works.  use //www.neopets.com/pound/adopt.phtml?search=PETNAMEHERE (replace "PETNAMEHERE" with the pet's actual name) to adopt pets. <br>  You need to click "ADOPT", 	and "OK" on the pop-up to adopt the pet.<br><br>

7. If borrowing via safe transfer, be sure to COPY &amp; PASTE the lender's username and verify that it is correct before returning the pet.
<br>
---------------<br><br>
8. Make sure you know exactly how to get the avatar you are seeking BEFORE the transfer (have the link to the Draik Nest ready or have your food already purchased, etc).<br><br>
9. Please make an effort to be kind. Remember that it costs lenders time and NP to let people borrow their pets, and they go out of their way to help those who need avatars. <br><br>
------------------<br><br>
	10. Please communicate clearly &amp; in an intelligent manner. Communication is 
	key throughout the process. Asking "plese cn i brrow ur pet" is not going to get you anywhere.<br><br>
	11. Do not refer borrowers to the lenders. They must be able to come here &amp; ask us themselves.<br><br>
12. If you use the Pin Option to protect your pets, don't forget to REMOVE it before beginning a transfer.</p>
