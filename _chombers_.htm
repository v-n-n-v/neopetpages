<font size="6"><b>Mitchy's guide about the bd for the pc</b><h2>Introduction and welcome</h2></font>
</h1>Welcome, everyone, to my guide about the Battledome. I created this guide because of the battledome craze circulating around the Pound Chat. Ever since the Forgotten Shore was introduced, Draiks and Krawks have significantly decreased in value. Oh, the days when Draiks and Krawks traded for Unconverted pets. The days of D/UC/K boards are over, and the bridge connecting UCs to converted pets has grown even smaller. There are few ways to break into the UC tiers, once of the most popular nowadays being Battledome pets (which will henceforth be referred to as BD pets). <br><br>In this guide, I will explain the battledome, what it means to be a BD pet, how to train, weapons and faerie abilities to take a look at (if you own/wish to own a BD pet and utilize him/her), and trading BD pets amongst other pets. If you notice any sections you believe I should include, please <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=lola123_52"> neomail me by clicking here.</a> Feel free to neomail me if you have a specific question about yourself/your pet, but please take the time to look through all of this guide first, as your question might be answered here. I do hope you enjoy this guide. <br><br>Please note that this is just a guide. <b>This guide is not law</b>. I am not telling anyone what they can or cannot trade for, or what they can or cannot do. This guide is based on my past experiences: what I personally have done, what I have seen others do, and what I have read. Now, without further ado, thank you, happy browsing, and best of luck!
</div>
<br><br><a name="2"></a><div id="mainbox">
<h1><font size="5"><b>Terminology </b></font></h1>
<h2>Basic Terms</h2>
<b>BD/Battledome:</b> The <a href="/dome">Battledome</a> (BD) is an area of the site, open 24 hours a day every day, in which you can send your neopet into a battle against an opponent generated by the computer (1-player fights) or against another user's neopet (2-player fights). You can equip up to 8 weapons on each pet. Every turn, you may choose two weapons at a time to fight with. Every turn, you may also choose a faerie ability, which can have different effects on that round of the battle depending on what you choose. Every attack you make can take away Hit Points, or HP, from your opponent. Every attack your opponent makes against you can take away your neopet's HP. Once someone's HP reaches 0, the battle is over, and the challenger that retained their hit points is the winner. In the battledome, if you're playing 1-player (1p) battles, you can win prizes such as codestones, dubloons, books, plushies, etcetera. Every day, you may win up to 1500 neopoints and 15 items from the Battledome.<br><br><b>HP/Hit Points/Endurance:</b> For this part, how better to explain HP but a quote from TNT themselves? Hit Points are a measurement of how many points your Neopet has left before you lose in the Battledome. If your Hit Points show 8/14 it means your Neopet has 8 out of a possible 14 points left. When your Neopet reaches zero Hit Points it can no longer fight in the Battledome and needs to be nursed back to health.<br><br><b>STR/Strength:</b> Strength is the ability to cause damage to your opponent in the BD. How much damage you can do depends heavily on your strength (and secondarily on your weapon). Strength increases the amount of damage weapons can do in the Battledome.
<br><br><b>DEF/Defence:</b> Defence is the ability to prevent/block damage inflicted by your opponent in the BD. Defence increases the amount of protection that defensive weapons can provide in the Battledome.
<br><br><b>MOV/Agility/Speed/Movement: </b> One of the most common questions I see is: "Does agility matter?" At the moment, honestly, no. It doesn't. It is not considered in HSD, it does not let you attack your opponent first. It does not make your attack faster and does not make you inflict/prevent more damage. Not to say Agility was completely useless, though. There was one weapon that utilized Agility in the Battledome: Heavy Robe of Thievery. Heavy Robe of Thievery had an 100% chance of stealing one of your opponent's items, which could be very useful. The robe would not work unless your Agility was trained to 201+. Unfortunately, this weapon is currently glitched in the Battledome. It will indicate that you stole a weapon in the log, but a new weapon does not appear in your set, and because of this, there's not much use for it. Considering the way things are now, should you train Agility? Only if you want that stat to look pretty.
<br><br><b>Intelligence/INT: </b>Intelligence? What is this doing here? Well, same thing as Agility (but Intelligence is more important). In order to use a weapon like Heavy Robe of Thievery, your intelligence had to be 67 or more. Weapons that currently utilize intelligence include Heavy Blue Tunic (a 100% freezer with some defensive icons, requires 1000 INT) and Crisp Blue Tunic (which occupies the healer slot, and drains 100 HP from your opponent to give to you; requires 750 INT). There are a few other items too, but those mentioned are the most noteworthy ones. The other side of intelligence is that, for competitive 2P play, low intelligence pets can be desired (though this is mostly academic now). Some weapons, like Flask of Liquid Fire and Flask of Liquid Light do extra icons against pets with intelligence above some score (it varies per item but it's usually pretty low).
<br><br><b>HSD:</b> If you look at any pet on their lookup, you will see a section marked "-Battledome Stats-." Underneath, you will see the categories of Hit Points, Strength, Defence, Movement, and Intelligence. HSD is the sum of Hit Points, Strength, and Defence. If a pet has 20 Hit Points, their Strength is 40, and their Defence is 32, then their HSD is 92. An important thing to note about HSD is that HSD only includes strength and defence up to and including 750. The reasoning behind this will be talked about more in the next term. Here's a practice problem for you: A pet has 1400 Hit Points, their Strength is 752, and their Defence is 430. What is this pet's HSD? <font size="1"><i>Answer: 2580HSD. Remember that HSD is HP+STR+DEF. Also remember that nothing exceeding 750 in Strength/Defence is included in HSD, however if HP exceeds 750, that is fine and is still included in HSD.</i></font>
<br><br><b>Stat Caps:</b> The current cap for STR, DEF, and MOV is 750.  A pet with 10,000 STR, DEF, and/or MOV will not be better in the BD than a pet with 750 for these stats. This is why anything above 750 in STR/DEF is not included in HSD; because it has no use in accordance to advantages in battle. Further explanation is provided in the "Icons and Boosts" section of this guide.
<br><br><b>BD pet:</b> Now, as with most things BD-related, this is where things start to get opinionated and subjective to whomever is trading their pet. In my personal opinion, I classify a BD pet as having 300HSD+. Labbed, even, trainable, untrainable, doesn't matter. 300HSD+, and I will consider your pet a BD pet. So what, you may ask, are pets below 300HSD called?
<br><br><b>SBD pet:</b> In my personal opinion, a pet below 300HSD is known as SBD, or semi-Battledome. These pets are starter battledome pets, and great for people wanting to start small/train on their own. 
<br><br><b>Trainable:</b> This is a term you will hear a lot. Trainable pets are pets with a level at least half of their other stats (HP, STR, DEF, and Agility). Intelligence does not play any sort of factor in a pet being trainable. Trainable means that the pet's stats can be trained in one of the Training Schools in Neopia (covered in the next few sections). If your level is below HP, STR, DEF, and/or Agility, this means that level must be raised to half of the highest stat before any stats can be raised. Hit Points are the strange exception here. Hit Points can be trained up to 3 times the number of your pet's current level, however as long as Hit Points are above twice the number of level, no other stats but Hit Points may be trained until level is brought up to half of HP. For example, my pet is level 51. HP is 42, STR is 10, DEF is 30 and Agility is 100. This pet is trainable, because level is at least half of the highest stat, which is Agility. Let's say that Agility is 105. This pet is no longer trainable, and in order to be trainable, level would have to be raised to 53 (you cannot train to 52.5; round up).
<br><br><b>Even:</b> Repeat after me: "Even does not mean trainable." Thank you. Moving right along, even stats mean that the individual stats in HSD are the same number or within 10 digits (subject to change depending upon person) of the same number. For example, HP of 50, STR of 55, and DEF of 48 is even. This can also and is often phrased as 50/55/48, with HP first, STR second, and DEF first (the order of the letters in HSD). If a stat exceeds 10 digits of another in HSD, the pet is not considered even. The exceptions, in my opinion, are pets with total HSD of above 300HSD. In this case, even can be considered within 50 digits. In the case of 700HSD or above, even can be considered within 100 digits.
<br><br><b>Uneven:</b> Repeat after me: "Uneven does not mean untrainable." Thank you. An example of uneven stats are: 50/55/39, or any variation of HSD in which any stat exceeds 10 digits of another.
<br><br><b>Labbed:</b> This is also a term you will hear a lot. When labbing your pet using the Secret Laboratory Map, your pet's stats are subject to change. The Lab Ray never removes HP and rarely removes Strength. The Lab Ray will oftentimes remove level, defense, and agility. The lab ray does not affect Intelligence. Labbed pets are typically uneven and untrainable.<br><br><h2>help! rather than numbers in my pet's stats, it shows terms?</h2> <center>

<font size="5"><b>Before I start the training section</b></font>
</h1>
You will hear people complain about training all the time, and for very, very good reason. Training is expensive and time-consuming. If you are not willing to put in lots of time, effort, and neopoints, then perhaps training isn't something you should be doing. I suggest having a steady income, knowing how to make neopoints, or having a lot saved up.<br><br>This training guide (the next few blocks) will go as if you just created the pet, and are now starting to train. This guide will also go with the assumption that you are not training Agility. If you have not just created the pet and your pet already has some stats, jump right in at wherever applies to you.<br><br>If you don't care as much about how many neopoints you spend, and care more about training your pet up quickly, skip the Swashbuckling Academy block and move onto the Mystery Island Training School block. <br><br>Please note that especially in the training part of the guide, none of this is law. These are things I would do, and have seen others do. <i>You can train your pet wherever and however you want</i>. With that said, enjoy!<br><br><h2>a few things that apply to all schools</h2>When enrolling into a course, you must go to the "course" tab in the training school. Scrolling down, you will be able to select what you'd like to teach your pet: Strength, Defence, Agility, Endurance, or Level. Below that, you have the ability of choosing which pet you'd like to teach this course. Next to the pet, it will tell you how much the course will cost.<br><br>Once you select which course you want to teach your pet and select "Start Course," you will automatically be taken to the "Status" tab of the school. There, you will see your pet, and to the right of it, the amount you have to pay in order for the course to begin. In order to pay, you must have what they are asking for in your inventory. Click "pay," the page will refresh, and you will see how much time you have left. Once the time runs out, visit the status page again and click on "Complete Course!" You will receive the stat you payed for (and a bonus if you're really lucky), and then you can renew the course on the "Courses" page.<br><br>All schools are capable of giving SUPER BONUSES. These bonuses can give you an extra 1-4 stat points on whatever you were raising. You find out if you got a SUPER BONUS or not when you redeem the extra stat once training time is up.<br><br>
All schools can train stats (HP, STR, DEF, MOV) to 2x your pet's current level. Endurance, however, can be trained to 3x your pet's current level. In order to train any other stat when Endurance is more than 2x level, level must be brought up to half of HP. For example. I have a level 20 pet. I train to 40/40/40 for HP/STR/DEF. I train Endurance up to 60, while still at level 20. This is possible. However, say I want to raise STR now. I can't unless level is half of my highest stat. So, 60/2 = 30. I must train to level 30 in order to raise any other stat.<br><br>It may be advisable not to train to the very upper limits of every suggested training method section, as faerie quests and random stat changes may occur. Just be aware of this.

<br> The <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/academy.phtml">Swashbuckling Academy</a> is located on Krawk Island, and is the first school for training pets. This is for beginners, as the Academy only accepts pets level 40 and under. All courses at Swashbuckling Academy are payed with Dubloons. The cost you pay (in dubloons) depends on the level of your pet. The School accepts <i>One, Two, </i>and <i>Five Dubloon Coins</i>.<br><br><center>

<br><h2>Tips for Swashbuckling</h2>Chose the wrong course for training? Don't panic! You can cancel any course at Swashbuckling you have not yet payed for, and there will be absolutely no penalty to you. Swashbuckling is the only school in which you can cancel a course without penalty.<br><br>Is today your pet's special day? If you have a Blumaroo on Blumaroo Day, or an Aisha on Aisha Day, etc., the Swashbuckling Academy will provide you with free training that day. Find out which day is your's <a href="//www.neopets.com/calendar.phtml">here.</a><br><br><b>Save all of your  codestones and start saving up and making neopoints when training at Swashbuckling Academy</b><br>I suggest everyone start at Swashbuckling because it is cheaper and the prices of Dubloons do not fluctuate as codestone prices can. Every One Dubloon Coin costs the same, but Codestones can range in price from 3,000-10,000. This is why, when you start training, I suggest you start hoarding them and making neopoints, because once you start codestone training, things can start getting expensive.<br><br><h2>suggested training method</h2>Remember that you can train however you wish, this is just what I suggest, have done, and have seen :)<br><br>First, check the table at the bottom of <a href="/~lil_arcticuna#2">Terminology</a> to see if your highest stat is a term rather than a number. Let's pretend you've just created a pet. These are an example of the starter stats you may have (thank you to <i>everyway</i> for these!):<br><center>
<br>Level: 1<br>Hit Points: 9 / 9<br>
Strength: average<br>
Defence: heavy<br>
Movement: breakneck<br>
Intelligence: average<br></center>
<br>Our highest stat here is Movement with "Breakneck," as seen by the chart, which is 13. Level is currently 1, and therefore no other stats can be trained until level is at least a half of the highest stat. Since 13 isn't evenly divisible by two, we round up. <br>13 / 2 = 6.5 = 7. We must train level up to 7.<br><br>Once level is trained up to 7, train your stats to 14, which is 2x of level. Next, train level up to 10. Train the other stats to 20, and make sure not to bring level up any more until the stats you wish to train are at 20. Once your stats are even at 20, train endurance to 30. Train level up to 19 or 20 (beware of bonuses that may accidentally push your pet over this limit!) and train your stats to 40/40/40. Then, train to 60/40/40. <br><br>If you'd like, another suggested method that won't cost you any more is train up level by level, stat by stat. Say we're at Level 8. All stats are at 16/16/16. Next you would train level up to 9. Then train stats to 18/18/18. Then level to 10. Then stats to 20/20/20. Then to 30/30/30. Get my drift? Train up Endurance at the end of each level block (11-20, 21-30, 31-40). Train all the way to level 40, stats to 120/80/80, and then switch to Mystery Island Training School.

<br>Which codestone the school will ask for during training is random, so it's handy to have all of these. The school may also ask for more than one of the same type of codestone during a course, so be prepared for that.<br><br>Unlike in the Swashbuckling Academy Training School, at the Mystery Island Training School you may not cancel a pet's course, so be very sure of which course you want to take before you click Start Course.<br><br>The Mystery Island Training School can train your pet's Endurance to 3x your pet's level. However, if Endurance is above level, no other stat may be raised until Level is once again a half of the highest stat (in this case, Endurance). Below is the chart for Mystery Island Training School courses, based upon level. The very left column shows the level, the middle column shows how much each course costs at that level, and the column to the right shows how long your pet will be on that course until you receive your stat raise and can put them into the School for another course.

<br><h2>if you skipped swashbuckling completely</h2>
Welcome! If you skipped Swashbuckling Academy, this means you don't mind spending (a lot) more neopoints on training, and care more about how quickly your pet is training (not a bad thing at all).<br><br>First, check the table at the bottom of <a href="/~lil_arcticuna#2">Terminology</a> to see if your highest stat is a term rather than a number. Let's pretend you've just created a pet. These are an example of the starter stats you may have (thank you to <i>everyway</i> for these!):<br><center>
<br>Level: 1<br>Hit Points: 9 / 9<br>
Strength: average<br>
Defence: heavy<br>
Movement: breakneck<br>
Intelligence: average<br></center>
<br>Our highest stat here is Movement with "Breakneck," as seen by the chart, which is 13. Level is currently 1, and therefore no other stats can be trained until level is at least a half of the highest stat. Since 13 isn't evenly divisible by two, we round up. <br>13 / 2 = 6.5 = 7. We must train level up to 7.<br><br>Once level is trained up to 7, train your stats to 14, which is 2x of level. Next, train level up to 10. Train the other stats to 20, and make sure not to bring level up any more until the stats you wish to train are at 20. Once your stats are even at 20, train level up to 19 or 20 (beware of bonuses that may accidentally push your pet over this limit!) and train your stats to 2x your level. <br><br>If you'd like, another suggested method that won't cost you any more is train up level by level, stat by stat. Say we're at Level 8. All stats are at 16/16/16. Next you would train level up to 9. Then train stats to 18/18/18. Then level to 10. Then stats to 20/20/20. <br><br>Whichever way you choose to follow, get level to 20, then stop training level. Get stats to 40/40/40, then 60/40/40. Next, I'd like you to get to level 40, with the stats of 80/80/80. Then, stats of 120/80/80. Now, just jump into the next section.
<br><br><h2>if you followed suggested training method</h2>
Welcome! If you completed Swashbuckling, I'd like to congratulate you! If you chose to go by Mystery Island Training School, welcome to you as well :) Now, I'm going off of the assumption that you're joining this section with level 40, and stats of 120/80/80. In this school, you can also train endurance to 3x your level. I have been told you can even train up to 3x your level + 3, but I'm going to go off the assumption this is not true until confirmation (can you confirm it?). At level 40, you would still be eligible to pay for a course with 2 codestones rather than 3. When you enter this school, if your stats are level 40, 120/80/80. Great! Move right along. If any of them are below that, simply train it up until you get there. Next, train up level to 60. Why? Because to train other stats, your level has to be half of your highest stat, which right now is Endurance. <br><br>Once your level is 60, go ahead and train it to 80. Then train your other stats to 160/160/160. Train to 200/160/160. <br><br>Once you pass level 80, you're paying 4 codestones per course. Train level to 100. Stay. Bring the other stats up to 200/200/200. Train to 240/200/200.<br><br>Train level to 120, which is half of Endurance. Stay at 120. Do not raise level. Train all to 240/240/240, then 300/240/240. Train level up 1. You're now paying 5 codestones per course. Is it starting to get too expensive for you? Move onto the next section. If you can bear the cost, keep reading here.<br><br>Train from 121 to level 150. 300/300/300. 400/300/300.<br><br>From level 150 to 200. Train stats to 400/400/400. 600/400/400. Up one. At this point, move onto the next section if you haven't already. It will be a lot cheaper to rush to 250 rather than continue training here, at the moment.<br><br><h2>rushing to 250</h2>This is something you'll probably hear about a lot. As stated before, training is expensive. There's a Secret Ninja School (in the next block) that accepts Red Codestones. Once you reach level 250, you may leave Mystery Island Training School and join the Secret Ninja Training School. Every course at level 250 costs 1 Red Codestones (ranging from 6,000-36,000 in price), and each course is 4 hours long. Which, if you compare to level 250 at the Mystery Island Training School, is a lot shorter of a price and time. <br><br>When you believe training has become way too expensive for you, start racing to 250. This means you ignore all other stats, and only train up level. If you get Faerie Quests for other stats, yes, complete them, but do not enroll your pet in a course for anything but Level. The point at which you switch to racing mode is different for everyone, and depends on the Neopian economy. Watch the prices of Red Codestones. Do you predict a rise in them/do they seem to be rising right now? Maybe hold off rushing. Do you predict the cost of them to lower? Maybe try rushing. I've seen people start rushing at 5 codestones per course, 6, 7, and even all the way at 8. I personally tend to rush at 6 or 7. What you do is up to you. Maybe you'll choose not to rush at all, and that's okay as well.

The school may also ask for more than one of the same type of codestone during a course, so be prepared for that.<br><br>Similarly to the Swashbuckling Academy and unlike the Mystery Island Training School, you may cancel courses at the Secret Ninja Training School. There are two reasons you might cancel a course: you chose the wrong course, or the course they put you on is too expensive. There is a 24 hour penalty to canceling in which you may not put that pet on a course in the Secret Ninja Training School. Once the 24 hours are up, you may select the proper course for your pet and the codestone(s) the school requests will be randomized once again.<br><br>The Secret Ninja Training School can train your pet's Endurance to 3x that of your level, much like in the Mystery Island Training School.

As stated before in <a href="/~lil_arcticuna#2">Terminology</a> (see HSD/Stat Caps sections) and lower in <a href="/~lil_arcticuna#8">Icons and Boosts</a>, there is no reason to train beyond 750 for STR and DEF. That's their max boosts; you will not have any more power/defence than a pet with 10,000 STR/DEF. So why do it? To me, it's a waste of neopoints. Unless you're just going to 800, in the hopes that TNT will release more boosts. Right now, though, you don't have to go above 750.

<h2>Faerie Quests</h2>
A Faerie Quest is a random event (RE) that can happen anywhere on the site. Occasionally, one of the faeries below will appear and send you on a quest for an item they seek. When they request an item, your shop wizard access becomes blocked. There is a <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=9">NeoBoard</a> specifically for Quest help, however if the quest is too expensive, you miss Shop Wizard too much, the quest isn't worth it for you, or whatever other reason, you can always cancel your quest <a href="//www.neopets.com/quests.phtml">here</a>. That link is also where you would go if you have returned with the Faerie's item. There is no time limit on quests; they last until you complete them or click reject, then your Shop Wizard access is again given back to you. Most items that a Faerie will ask for restocks at a Neopian shop. If applicable to the Faerie, the link to the shop their items restock in is shown below. Completing a quest does not go un-noted for the Faeries, of course. Upon completion, each Faerie gives you something. Now we'll be covering what each Faerie asks for, what she gives you upon completion, and the shop her requested items restock in (if applicable).<center>

<br><br><b>FQCs/Faerie Quest Fortune Cookies:</b> These NC Mall Fortune Cookies, when opened, will grant you one guaranteed Faerie Quest per day. To access these faerie quests, you must visit the <a href="/quests.phtml">main faerie quest page</a>. The quests from the FQC are given every Neopian day. If you choose to reject a quest while on the FQC, you will still get one the following Neopian day (but not another one from the FQC on the day you rejected), as long as the cookie hasn't reached the 7 day mark. FQCs can give any Faerie, including Fountain. If you do not reject nor complete a quest and the quest travels into the next neopian day, it will still be there, however after completion/rejection, you will not get another quest from the cookie that day. If using these cookies, I suggest having your Shop Wizard open before the quest. As long as you're on the Shop Wizard page before you get your quest, you can use the Shop Wizard.<br><br><h2>Secret Laboratory Map</h2>
<b>LRC/Lab Ray Fortune Cookie:</b> In the previous section we covered the effects that the Secret Laboratory Map can have on your pet. Using this NC Fortune Cookie, you may have access to zapping your pets more than once a day. When you open the cookie, you find out how many zaps you will have that day, and you will have these zaps for 7 days. After 7 days, you lose these extra zaps and go back down to one zap per day, until you open another LRC. These can be useful to you if you tend to lab your pet every day. TNT has told us in the cookies FAQ that it should only be use for main accounts, but <a href="/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=565">editorial #565</a> tells us that if you do not have the Lab Map on your main account, you are allowed to use this cookie on side accounts.<br><br><h2>foods/neggs/potions/books/scratchcards</h2>First of all, we should go over whether it's worth it or not for your pet to use these in order to train up. For most people, it won't be. I wouldn't suggest using the method of foods/neggs/potions/books unless you're at the Secret Ninja Training School and are using multiple red codestones per course. I do, however, encourage everyone to use the Scratchcards. Furthermore, I will not be covering all of the Neggs/Potions/Books. I'll cover the ones that are my favorites, the cheapest, and the most effective c: With that being said, enjoy!<br><br><i>Tips for Neggs/Foods: Typically you can feed neggs/food to your pet once per day, however if you get their hunger status to "dying," neggs/foods can be fed every one to two hours.

BBQ Porkwich gives your pet one defence point per consumption, and is comparable to the Armoured Negg (next). These can be created by mixing Bread and Neopox Pizza in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/cookingpot.phtml">Cooking Pot</a>. If you plan on using a defence-increasing item, compare prices of the BBQ Porkwich and the Armoured Negg and see which would fit your budget better before making the decision.
<br><br>~ ~ ~<br><br><b>Armoured Negg</b><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/armorednegg.gif" height="60" width="60"><br>Armoured Neggs are one of the best alternate training methods for defence out there. The commonly used term <i>A-Negging</i> comes from these. Every time you feed a pet an Armoured Negg, it raises defence by 1. The nice part of these is that you can use these in parallel to training other stats. You can get these for 16 Negg Points at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/neggery.phtml">Neopian Neggery</a>, or you can just buy them off of the Shop Wizard.

Cool Neggs can be purchased for 247 Tokens at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/neggery.phtml">Neopian Neggery</a>.

<b>Wheel of Extravagance:</b> This is a pretty popular method for people with very high-stated pets. Spinning the <a href="//www.neopets.com/desert/extravagance.phtml">Wheel of Extravagance</a> in Qasala costs 100,000 neopoints. There are 12 possible spots this wheel could land on, and 2/12 of them are stat boosts. If you land on a spot that shows 1 arm flexing, 5 points are added to your active pet's HP, STR, DEF, MOV, or INT. It's random. If you land on a space with 2 arms flexing, a 10% increase (if your stats are low to begin with) or 10 points are added to your active pet's HP, STR, DEF, MOV, or INT.<br><br><b>TC/Training Fortune Cookies:</b> These NC Mall Fortune Cookies grant you 30%-75% reduced time in all schools (Swashbuckling, Mystery, and Secret) for 5 days.

<h1><font size="5"><b>Icons and Boosts</b></font></h1>
<h2>Icons</h2>

Personally I think that icons and boosts are the most confusing and advanced part of the battledome, so please excuse me if it takes a bit to explain.<br><br>

Now then. Every weapon in the battledome is linked to icons. If the item weapon is offensive, they will have icons that attack. If the item is defensive, it will have icon blocks. If the item is dual-duty, it will have both. There are seven total icons, and seven total icon blocks that correspond to them. Offensive icons just show the element, while defensive icons show that element crossed out in red. <br><br>
The seven icons are fire, water, air, physical, light, dark, and earth. No icon has more power than another icon, and an icon does not attack better against a certain color/species. For example, an earth icon will not do any better than a fire icon against a Koi or Water-colored neopet. The amount of damage done with icons alone depends on how many icons are linked to the offensive weapon in question, and how many items the opponent's potential defensive weapon will block off, as well as which one. To give you an example, say we have a Skull and Crossbow versus a Sturdy Blue Shield.<br><br>

The Skull and Crossbow has eight offensive icons: INSERT<br>The Sturdy Blue Shield has six defensive icons: INSERT <br><br>Assuming no faerie abilities were used, and no other weapons were used, let's see what happens. The pet using the Skull and Crossbow will be referred to as the offensive pet, and the pet using the Sturdy Blue Shield will be referred to as the defensive pet. The Shield's earth defensive icons do not make a difference, because the Skull and Crossbow has no offensive earth icons to deal out damage. The Shield successfully blocked two air icons and two physical icons. The icons the Shield was unable to block were an air icon, a physical icon, and two dark icons. Keep in mind that the offensive pet did not take any damage this round, because the defensive pet did not use a weapon with any offensive icons. So, we know that four icons hit the defensive pet. How do we find out how much damage the defensive pet took? That's where we get into boosts.
<br><br><h2>boosts</h2>
Boosts determine the damage per icon. Below you will see a chart demonstrating this. Let's take the example above. We know that four icons made it through. Let's say that the offensive pet had a strength of 100. If we look on the chart below, we can see that the strength of 100 falls between 85 to 124. Looking to the right of this number, we see the number 2.5. This is how much damage per icon this offensive pet can deal. If only one icon made it through, the damage done would be 2.5. Since four icons made it through, we multiply 4 by 2.5. The total damage done to the defensive pet was 10. The defensive pet loses 10 HP. In a perfect world, of course. Unfortunately it's not that simple (well, fortunately for the defensive pet). <br><br>Looking at the chart below, we see that defence also has its own boosts. Strength for offensive weapons works the same way as defence for defence weapons; they are more effective if used by a pet with a higher defence boost. For the example above, we had to assume that the defence boost of the defensive pet matched the strength boost of the offensive pet. If this was not the case, and the defence of the defensive pet were lower than the strength of the offensive pet, then more than 4 icons would've passed through. Small parts of the icons blocked would have made it past the shield, thereby causing more damage to the defensive pet. Again, the higher the defence, the more effective the shield.<br><br><h2>Boost chart</h2>In the boost chart, the boosts only go up to 750. There isn't a point in training past here in terms of boosts, because there are none higher. This means that a pet with 10,000 STR will not attack better than a pet with 751 STR. Some owners choose to train up to 800, hoping for TNT to announce the next boost. Do as you wish with your own pet :)<br><br><center>

<h1><font size="5"><b>my favorite weapons overview</b></font></h1>
<h2>offensive weapons</h2>
<center>Offensive weapons are the weapons that only deal damage. Personally, I'm an offensive battler, so offensive weapons are my favorite weapons. Let's look over a few of them...<br><br>~ ~ ~<br><br><b>Ylanas Blaster</b><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/ros_bd_ylanasblaster.gif" height="60" width="60"><br><i>Estimated price range:</i> 800K-1.2M<br><i>Icons:</i> <i>(5 fire, 2 air, 3 physical, 2.6 earth, 12.6 icons total)</i><br><i>Notes:</i> This was a game prize worth 25,000 points in the Return of Dr. Sloth plot<br><i>Review:</i> This weapon is a personal favorite of mine. I like the price-to-icon ratio, and I tend to suggest this weapon to others with a price-range within 1mil.<br><br>~ ~ ~<br><br><b>Brynns Legendary Sword of Wraith Smiting</b><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_sword_brynnrep.gif" height="60" width="60"><br><i>Estimated Price:</i> 800K-1.2M<br><i>Icons:</i> <i>(3 fire, 3 earth, 1.75 light, 5 physical, 12.75 icons total)</i><br><i>Notes:</i> This was a prize worth 50,000 points in the Faeries' Ruin Plot.<br><i>Review:</i> This weapon is quite similar to Ylanas Blaster, with just a few icons switched around. I suggest them both and like them both quite equally. If you plan on getting one or the other, pay attention to which icons you would prefer, but ultimately it just comes down to which one costs more at the moment.<br><br>~ ~ ~<br><br><b>Scroll of Ultranova</b><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bvs_ultranova_scroll.gif" height="60" width="60"><br><i>Estimated Price:</i> Less than 1K<br><i>Icons:</i> <i>(3.4 fire, 3.4 air, 3 light, 9.8 icons total)</i><br><i>Notes:</i> Restocks at <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=78">The Scrollery</a>, but I'd suggest buying it off of the Shop Wizard<br><i>Review:</i> At the time of writing (March 31, 2014), I found this weapon for 1NP, 5NP, and 10NP all over the Shop Wizard. The price-to-icon ratio is amazing, and I highly suggest this weapon to users who cannot afford higher. The icons get through most common shields in the Battledome, such as Leaf Shield and Sophies Magic Hat.<br><br>~ ~ ~<br><br><b>Scroll of Knowledge</b><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bvs_scrollof_knowledge.gif" height="60" width="60"><br><i>Estimated Price:</i> 50K-100K<br><i>Icons:</i> <i>(2 earth, 2 water, 2 dark, 2 air, 3 light, 11 icons total)</i><br><i>Notes:</i> Restocks at <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=78">The Scrollery</a><br><i>Review:</i> Personally this is one of my favorite weapons, and I own two. However I bought them when they were much cheaper, and nowadays the price-to-power ratio isn't the best, so only buy this if you're alright with paying ~4x the price for 1-2 extra icons.<br><br>~ ~ ~<br><br><b>Ridiculously Heavy Battle Hammer</b><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_heavybattlehammer.gif" height="60" width="60"><br><i>Estimated Price:</i> ~100NP<br><i>Icons:</i> <i>(3 air, 3 earth, 3 physical, 9 icons total)</i><br><i>Notes:</i> Restocks at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=9">Battle Magic</a> shop, but I suggest buying it off of the Shop Wizard. Dropped a lot in price due to its increase in supply from the 2011 Game Master Challenge.<br><i>Review:</i> I would only suggest this for beginner battles. The icons are easily blocked in 2-player battles, but the price-to-power ratio is quite nice.<br><br>~ ~ ~<br><br><b>Scroll of the Scholar</b><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bvs_scroll_scholar.gif" height="60" width="60"><br><i>Estimated Price:</i> ~10K<br><i>Icons:</i> <i>(2 earth, 2 air, 2 dark, 2 water, 2 light, 10 icons total))</i><br><i>Notes:</i> This item restocks at <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=78">The Scrollery</a>, and is also a book (if you read it to your pet, it disappears)<br><i>Review:</i> It loses only one icon to the Scroll of Knowledge, which is a small price to pay considering the ~70K drop in what you'd be paying to get the Scroll. The icon types are not the best for two-player, but this weapon is fine for one-player battling.<br><br>~ ~ ~<br><br><b>Super Attack Pea</b><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_superpea.gif" height="60" width="60"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/superpea.gif"><br><i>Estimated Price:</i> 1B<br><i>Icons:</i> <i>(12 air, 20 earth, 32 icons total)</i><br><i>Note:</i> Gives the Super Attack Pea avatar (when equipped to a Pea Chia), featured to the right of the weapon<br><i>Review:</i> This is the most powerful weapon ever released, and the most expensive item on neopets. Earth is common and air is nice, but at this level of BD fighting, defense is widespread. The price for this weapon is outrageous.

<h1><font size="5"><b>my favorite faerie abilities overview</b></font></h1>
<h2>What and how</h2>
This is pretty important, otherwise the rest of this block won't make sense. Every turn in the Battledome, you may choose two weapons. You may also use one Faerie Ability per turn (but you might not be able to use certain faerie abilities more than once per battle/day). Faerie abilities are an "extra." Some heal you, some help you attack, and some help you block. These can be extremely helpful in both 1p and 2p battles, and I highly suggest using faerie abilities. So, how do you get said faerie abilities? By visiting <a href="//www.neopets.com/dome/abilities.phtml">here</a>, you'll be able to see if you already have abilities. This is also where you can unlock your desired faerie abilities. Click on your pet and open up all of the levels that your pet has passed. If an ability is shaded, you have not yet unlocked it. If it is not shaded and has a green border around it, you have unlocked it. To the right of the Abilities page, you will see a bar with six icons there (excluding physical). These are the Faerie Blessings that pet currently has. Using these blessings, you can unlock faerie abilities. Weak Bottled Faerie Potions bless your pets. All of the Weak Bottled Faerie Potions are listed below.<br><br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_botfae1_earth.gif" height="30" width="30"> Weak Bottled Earth Faerie gives your pet 1-2 Earth Blessings<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_botfae1_air.gif" height="30" width="30">Weak Bottled Air Faerie gives your pet 1-2 Air Blessings<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_botfae1_fire.gif" height="30" width="30">Weak Bottled Fire Faerie gives your pet 1-2 Fire Blessings<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_botfae1_dark.gif" height="30" width="30">Weak Bottled Dark Faerie gives your pet 1-2 Dark Blessings<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_botfae1_light.gif" height="30" width="30">Weak Bottled Light Faerie gives your pet 1-2 Light Blessings<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_botfae1_water.gif" height="30" width="30">Weak Bottled Water Faerie gives your pet 1-2 Water Blessings<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_botfae1_meta.gif" height="30" width="30"> The Unidentifiable Bottled Faerie gives your pet 1-2 random Blessings<br><br><br>You can get these from the Shop Wizard, drops in the Battledome, the Trading Post, <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/igloo.phtml">Igloo Garage Sale</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/garage.phtml">Almost Abandoned Attic</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/snowfaerie.phtml">Snow Faerie Quests</a>, the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/wheel.phtml">Wheel of Excitement</a>, or wishing for them at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/wishing.phtml">Wishing Well</a>. However, I prefer the battledome (since they're common prizes) or the shop wizard. Once you've blessed your pet with the Weak Bottled Faeries you want and the proper amount, you can select the ability you'd like (as long as your pet is at or above the required level), and the ability is that pet's forever. The type and amount of blessings required per ability vary, so onto the next section!<br><br><font size="1">If you wish to find out information about any abilities I didn't cover, visit TheDailyNeopet's Battlepedia.

I only suggest this for low-end players. It doesn't make much difference to use in higher-level battles, and if you're at a higher level, there are many more, better abilities you could be using instead of this. For example, once your pet is at level 25, I suggest you start using the ability for that level, which is further down.</center>

I just chose Meepit Stampede because my set doesn't use much dark offensive icons, and many intermediate popular shields either don't block dark at all or block only a bit of dark. Which one you choose in this tier (if you use level 500 abilities at all) should depend on your personal weapons (the icons they deal), and who you battle. All the ones in this tier can be used once per day.</center>

<font size="5"><b>Leagues</b></font>
</h1>
Leagues are a way to categorize pet builds, so equal-stated pets fight against each other, evening the odds of the battle and making the BD fighting rely on ability more than, say, a strength boost. The information in this block for L97 was taken mostly from the JellyNeo In-Depth Battlepedia. L97 being the most popular league right now, it is the only one that will be covered in this block. If you think another League should be added and you have enough information on it, <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=lola123_52">neomail me</a>.<br><br><h2>League 97/L97</h2> L97 requires a build of 97/20/35. Any pet above those stats may not be admitted into L97. All participants must have the 20 Strength boost and 35 Defence boost and should make every attempt possible to have exactly 97HP. L97 has restrictions and limitations on the weapons you can use so battles are longer. The restrictions prevent battles from ending in a few turns, and makes it more about your battling ability and less upon luck to get a win. Here are a few rules for L97:<br><ul><li>No single use items are allowed (weapons that break after one use in battle).</li>
<li>Weapons that exceed 12.0 offensive/attack icons are not allowed</li>
<li>Dual Duty weaponry may not exceed 15.0 total icons</li>
<li>No 100% block Dual Duties are allowed</li>
<li>Stealing and Freezing are prohibited unless both battlers agree to use them</li>
<li>Weapons capable of healing multiple times in a battle are not allowed</li>
<li>Faerie abilities in the Level 50 tier and above are not allowed</li>
<li>Participants are asked to use their own weapons, however borrowing an L97 pet is allowed</li>
</ul>
To view more rules about L97, please visit Jellyneo's In-Depth Battlepedia.

<font size="5"><b>Healing</b></font> <font size="3">(outside of the battledome)</font>
</h1>
You've had a tough battle, maybe an event wasn't nice to you, and your HP is low. No worries, there's a few quick and easy fixes to this that I'll teach you about.<br><br><h2>Healing springs</h2>
<center><img src="//images.neopets.com/faerieland/springs3.gif"></center>
<br>The <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/springs.phtml">Healing Springs</a> is home to a Faerie with mystical powers. When visiting her, you have a couple of options. She can heal your pets, and you can visit her shop. If your pet has come down with an illness or is low on HP, she should be your first resort. Make sure that the sick pet/the one you most want to heal is your active pet. Sometimes, she will feel generous and restore all of your pets back to full health, sometimes she will give only a few HP to you, sometimes she will give you a potion/snowball, and sometimes whatever she does only affects your active pet. You can visit her to be potentially healed every 30 minutes. You can also buy an item from her shop every half hour, however the items in her shop are usually sold for cheaper in the Shop Wizard.<br><br><h2>Potions</h2>Obviously, visiting the Healing Springs Faerie to get healed for free isn't the only option, although it is the cheapest way. Here I will only talk about HP, not illnesses. If you have an illness and would like to buy the cure, visit <a href="//www.neopets.com/hospital.phtml">here</a> to find out what cure you would need to buy. Anyways, here's a list of my personal favorite potion (ones I use/have used), and what they do in healing your HP.<br><br><center>

<b>Healing Potion I-XII</b>: There are 12 Healing Potions in this set, all used outside of the Battledome. I wrote how much they heal you to the right of each potion. Don't ask me why the amount it heals doesn't follow proper Roman numerals, as the potion names do. I don't know. It's weird. These can be purchased at the Healing Springs or the Shop Wizard, if you so choose.<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/negg_bluefurry.gif" height="65" width="65"></center>
<br><b>Blue Furry Negg:</b> Not a potion, but hey, worth mentioning. These heal your pet by 5 HP upon consumption. If you wish to use this, your pet must be hungry (not checked into the NeoLodge). These can be bought extremely cheap on the Shop Wizard.<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mag_healing_purple.gif" height="65" width="65"></center>

<font size="5"><b>BD Past Trades</b></font>  <font size="3">(unconverted BDs)</font>
</h1>This is where trades of unconverted (UC) pets with stats will go. If you'd like to train an unconverted pet to add value, note that unconverted pets with stats are not extremely popular due to certain weapons in 2p fights that can change a pet's species, and thereby, unconvert a neopet. If you have recently completed a BD trade, please <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=lola123_52">neomail me</a>. If you are neomailing for this section, have the title be <i>UC BD Past Trade</i>. I will not put up any trades that are extremely one-sided, or seem too good to be true (such as a scam). BD to BD trades are perfectly acceptable. Thanks!<br><br><h2>150 to 300HSD</h2>

<br>Want to be an affiliate? <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=lola123_52">Neomail me</a>.<br><br><h2>about mitchy</h2>Hi there! My name's Mitchy, and I created this guide c: It took a bunch of work, but I've gotten so many nice things said to me, and I really think it might help people, so it's worth it to me^^ I currently own 14 BD pets and one SBD pet, which I plan on training up as soon as I finish the training of a few others c: I collect funny item descriptions. You may ask what that is... well, just click <a href="/gallery/index.phtml?gu=lola123_52">here</a> and you'll find out! I'm always buying tan and red codestones, as well as dubloons and neggs (that work at the neggery) to help enhance my training. I love llamas, but I don't love Gnorbus enough to own one. Oops. I like reading, writing, drawing, and of course, the BD. The BD is probably the reason I stay on neo. Yay x) I love nice people and funny people and super awesome people. I do not love rude people and white chocolate.
