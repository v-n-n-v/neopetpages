<div class="title_caption">All-star 13x, K.I.L.L. captain, <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Treasur">AC reformer</a> / July 17th, 2022</div>
<div id="question"><b>What do you generally spend your time on on Neopets?</b><p>I do my dailies pretty much every day, even if I'm not around as much. If I'm not trying (failing) to spend less time on the site, I'll lazily refresh auctions and newest 20 trades at least a bit throughout the day, and I'll probably lurk a bit in the TC &amp; Site Events boards.<br><br>I'm not as active on the TC these days though, and board 7 is kind of boring without site events (although if there's drama around the site, e.g., NFTs, neo_truths posts, etc., there's usually a funny board or two to read).
</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>I noticed on your lookup you have 10+ all-star trophies for the Altador Cup. Do you mind describing your prior + current involvement in the AC, both in terms of the game and associated communities?</b><p>Sure! I've been around in all 17 Altador Cups, at least a little - I played a handful of games in the first year, but that was it. When I saw that the event was back again in 2007, I started participating more on the boards and spent some time with my team's chat group - Krawk Island Living Legends (K.I.L.L.). The boards were obviously much more active then, and I loved the energy and excitement of it all, even though I barely knew what was going on in the earliest years of the event. I got more involved every year, but I still took a lot of breaks during the "offseasons", so I would say it was more of a casual thing for me back then, even though I have some of my fondest Neopets memories from those years.<br><br>After Krawk Island won the fourth AC in 2009, many of the older K.I.L.L. members stopped playing Neopets much, and that's sort of how I ended up becoming a "leader" in the team. I sort of stumbled into the role, as I was one of the few people who had been around for several years already, and I was around and willing to answer new players' questions. I was never really one of the top players, but I tried to help people out on the boards whenever I could, and I enjoyed the community &amp; competitive aspects of the event. A lot has changed since then, but I'm still here, trying to help people with tips for the games, strategizing for the team as a whole, and meeting hundreds of people over the years. Even though the event and the site have certainly seen better days, the community has kept me coming back for all these years.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>The community aspect of it sounds like a lot of fun, and clearly its members are still very passionate about the event (more on that later!). Do you enjoy the time spent playing the different games?</b><p>Honestly, no. I don't think anyone really "enjoys" that part of the event - it's more like trying to enjoy the event despite the grind. Particularly after the transition to the HTML5 games, I'm not sure if anyone really likes playing the games over and over for a month. People typically multi-task and try to watch or listen to something while they play, or hang out in servers with friends who might also be playing, etc. Anything that breaks up the monotony is beneficial - sure, people are motivated by prize points and helping their teams, but that doesn't make the grind itself any more fun. Each game can only be played a certain number of times every day, and TNT has lowered that number a couple of times over the years, and I don't think anyone would complain if TNT lowered those limits further and improved the games themselves.<br><br>People's love for the event is mostly based in nostalgia at this point - people love what the cup used to be, or maybe what the cup used to feel like for them, if that makes sense. There's still a... I'll call it a "dedicated, but tired" community around the event, and between that and the prizes, I'm sure people will keep coming back as long as the event is held. But between growing up and TNT continually dropping the ball (regarding the event specifically, but also the site as a whole), it's harder and harder to justify the amount of time the event expects from people.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>What do you like about K.I.L.L. specifically? Is it familiarity, or is there something special about it beyond that?</b><p>I'm sure familiarity is a part of my fondness for K.I.L.L., but I do think there's more to it. It's hard to try to put it into words, because K.I.L.L. has meant so many different things over the years, even just from my own perspective, not to mention everyone else's.<br><br>There's obviously the K.I.L.L. chat group on the boards, and especially back when things were more active on Neopets, that was a very distinct "thing" - it was always the biggest "hub" for Krawk Island players in the cup, yes, but it wasn't quite as all-encompassing as it is now. Krawk Island and K.I.L.L. weren't the same thing, sometimes to the detriment of both. I saw it as the friendly, fun group where I didn't have to worry about encountering "mean Krawk Island players" and didn't have to worry quite as much about being called a "mean Krawk Island player". But on the other hand, some people within our own team saw K.I.L.L. as "cliquey" or "elitist" or just "annoying". K.I.L.L. had its own jokes, its own traditions, and its own reputation, separate even from KI, and I do think we could've done more to include people who weren't already established in the community. Even in its earliest days, it was the same fun group of rambunctious pirates that it's always been, but at least for me, it was more "about" the actual event on the site. We were close friends too, but we were mostly quite young, and the site was still so large, so… everything about the actual Altador Cup felt a lot more meaningful then. I would say the earlier days are when my fondest Neopets memories were made, but maybe not my fondest K.I.L.L. memories.<br><br>In 2011, around the time of the 6th AC, the original K.I.L.L. guild was already rather inactive, and a few of us decided to make a more inclusive guild, Armada, and ostensibly that was a step toward organizing ourselves better to try to win the Cup again. But I would say that it was also the start of a subtler shift in what K.I.L.L. was about? That was the last year before the format of the Cup shifted (in a bad way), and the Cup has mostly been dominated by cheating groups and "all-star groups" - basically groups of all-stars who pick a different team together each year, similarly to something like the Obelisk guild.<br><br>I think there were quite a few years where K.I.L.L. was in a sort of confusing spot, with the AC and the site both going downhill and seeming less important, while obviously a lot of us were still friends, and we always wanted to maintain some sort of presence on the site. We still have the board, and the guild, and I still send out lots of neomails to people who join Krawk Island. But as the group has largely moved offsite, it's just a very different vibe. It's a lot less of me and a few other people just trying to guide the team in the cup, and a lot more… I don't know, human? We still go a little crazy every June, and there are people who are a part of K.I.L.L. for the AC alone. But K.I.L.L. is just a group of people, and I think we all care a lot about maintaining an inclusive, comfortable community, which has become by far my main concern over the last several years. And while that may sound a bit basic, I definitely don't think those sorts of communities are common online or off.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>You have an outsized role in your team's community, but also a voice beyond that (e.g. multiple people requested this interview, you have multiple boards up/share messages in neocord that receive a lot of community engagement). Kinda a nebulous question, but how do you feel about your role in the community / the way other people seem to perceive it?</b><p>I don't know, I don't think too much about my role in the community, particularly outside of the Altador Cup. I guess I felt like I very much became a "known" person on the AC side of things, which kind of "made sense" to me because I was very active and I'm outspoken about the Cup - not just as a "leader" of a big team, but sort of as a fanatic in the earlier days, and then a critic in more recent years. Any recognition outside of AC discourse is a lot more surprising to me, but maybe I should give myself more credit, I don't know. I think as the annual Altador Cup boards turned into the Site Event boards years ago, that meant that I was just… around for more of the general site discourse as well. Not to mention, as Neo has hemorrhaged users over the last decade-plus of mismanagement, I guess it's that much easier to be remembered if you stick around on the same account.<br><br>It was way weirder when people started to recognize me as a TCer (rather than "the KI guy"), since I never felt like I was doing anything special on the TC, and there are so many big personalities on that side of the site. Or the few times I've talked to people who seemed to think that I was, like, a noteworthy person? Like, I'm just a guy who's still on Neopets.com in 2022; it's not that serious.<br><br>I knew I stood out regarding the AC, if only because I used to talk too much about it, but not really anywhere else on Neo. I guess I've always been around a lot, both on site and in servers, so it's kind of hard for people not to bump into me from time to time. When I heard that multiple people were interested in hearing this interview, I was kind of confused, since I've been trying to shut up more often over the last couple of years. But I do enjoy rambling about Neopets when I can, so I'm happy to have the opportunity.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>You've compiled some charts detailing user activity in the cup. One of the most striking ones is the histogram of users by rank, which shows that the distribution there is suuuper bimodal. a majority of users either (1) do not participate in the cup or have minimal activity, or (2) are reaching all-star. The volume of users ending the cup at the individual ranks in b/w those cohorts is very low.<br><br>The straightforward takeaway here is that users are either uninterested in the cup, or extremely committed, with no in between. We can probably infer from context that the bugs &amp; grindiness of the event contribute to the size of that former group.<br><br>What kinda restructuring or changes to the games or to cup format do you think would broaden the appeal of the AC?</b><p>Yes, it's probably always been an "all-or-nothing" event to an extent, but it's become very pronounced in recent years. The transition from Flash to HTML5 games has only made things worse, as there have been far fewer all-stars in the last two years. It's pretty grim.<br><br>The real answer is to scrap the whole thing, and I don't say that lightly. Seriously, if anyone on staff reads this: TNT, I'm begging you to cancel next year's cup. I won't even ask you to replace it with something else until the year after next. Spend the extra time fixing some of the other broken parts of the site.<br><br>They won't do that, though, because it's one of the only events left. I could probably talk all day about ways to make the event less painful next time around, but I'll try to pick my top 5 suggestions.</p><ul><li>Rebalance the rank/prize points, and make them correlate with points-scored, not game submissions. It doesn't make sense that spending 8 minutes on a 2000-point Slushie Slinger game is rewarded with the same number of points as a 3-minute, 300-point game, for example.</li><li>Bring back interactive captchas for all 4 games. I can appreciate TNT wanting to try simpler authentication methods, so legitimate players don't have to fill out so many puzzles, but it's hilarious that they didn't expect any resistance from the ACG. I can understand if TNT didn't expect them to get through this method, but everyone knew that they would at least be trying.</li><li>Combine the teams in some fashion. Spreading users so thin is part of the reason that ACGs/ASGs are so influential – teams are too small, and very few people play beyond the first few days. I genuinely with they would give us a two- or four-team event. It would be shorter, and maybe less imbalanced (assuming they stop the ACG, which seems unlikely).</li><li>Make the HTML5 games less terrible. The games all function very differently (if at all) across devices. They've had years to make the games better, and they still haven't. They're welcome to remove Make Some Noise from the event, too.</li><li>Particularly in the absence of the above four suggestions, lower the maximum number of game submissions per day dramatically. Like, three per day in each game. Maybe five. The competitive side of this event has been a joke almost every year for one reason or another. This way, TNT would at least waste less of everyone's time.</li></ul>This is drastically different from what I would've recommended even just a few years ago, but I don't trust TNT with the event at all anymore. As a "team leader" I would genuinely feel bad trying to encourage people to continue spending time on the event if we don't see some significant changes, particularly as they continue to ignore their mistakes from this year.</div>
<div id="question"><b>Can you ELI5 what went wrong with the results this time?</b><p>After the final round was over, TNT changed the results. In theory, that's okay, because the results were manipulated by the ACG once again, and it would make sense to try to adjust the results to counter those efforts. The ACG primarily seemed to join Darigan Citadel, but there were allegedly a number of cheaters across several other teams, including my own. To keep it brief, Darigan Citadel moved up from 4th to 1st, while Meridell – which SOTAC, the ASG, joined – moved from 1st to 3rd, along with other bizarre changes vs. the original results.<br><br>Neo_truths also said that TNT, in their misguided attempt to clean up the results, banned hundreds of accounts from contributing to their teams' scores. A big part of this whole controversy is that they mostly seem to have banned active, legitimate players, and they still didn't get the results right. Obviously, neo_truths could also be wrong, but TNT took a similar approach in a couple of the earlier ACs, so the idea that they would shadow ban users isn't really novel. It's at least true that the results are very different from what people were expecting, and TNT needs to attempt to offer some kind of explanation there. </p></div>
<div id="question"><b>How did this impact you and your team?</b><p>Unfortunately, a couple of people with a bunch of shell accounts had boosted our results pretty dramatically for a few days, including at least the first couple of days of the finals. That threw things off for us regardless of TNT's decisions - a lot of us weren't comfortable with finishing on the podium after that, even though we at least had a shot at 3rd or perhaps 2nd, even without that boost.<br><br>For us, the damage was already done, and I think we were pretty much fine with ending in 5th place. But the bans caught 12 of our top 15 players, and around 60 normal users overall, including me. To TNT's credit, they did ban ~25 of the aforementioned cheaters/shells, and I'm not delusional enough to suggest that it's impossible that any of those "normal users" weren't playing legitimately. But even with a more pessimistic view, there's at least no evidence to suggest that they were cheating, and it's abundantly clear that there were an unacceptable number of false positives here.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Couple questions: Why do you think it went so wrong, and does the process of computing standings need to be so complex? Can you think of any plausible reasons TNT made the choices they did?</b><p>The whole thing seems to be a series of mistakes on top of a poor understanding of their own event. I imagine that the team was vaguely aware of cheating affecting the results, and someone was told to "fix it", but they had no idea what they were even looking for. Additionally, while the the results themselves aren't that complicated, I'm sure the code itself is a mess. It probably isn't straightforward to adjust the results like this, so there were likely further mistakes made as they tried to recreate the results. I really don't think there's an explanation beyond that. I guess it's possible that TNT intentionally lowered Meridell's scores further due to SOTAC, but (at the very least) they shouldn't have done something like that after the fact, and it still doesn't explain why DC ended up on top.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Are you supportive of ASGs? How do you think they impact the experience for other users?</b><p>No, I've never been a fan of ASGs. They were much more problematic in their earlier years, when they had serious issues integrating with their chosen teams, but they're still the focus of a lot of AC discourse on the boards and in servers. There's just one ASG these days, SOTAC, and they've gotten better about respecting the "normal" members of whichever team they join, and since they're (generally) playing the games legitimately, they're not breaking any rules. Some have tried to compare their efforts to things like people inflating items together, which has been a hot topic lately with all the Merchant Plus drama, but clearly TNT hasn't felt that SOTAC is violating the rules. I think most people have just accepted that they're not going anywhere.<br><br>Still, most people who care about the event want their teams to do well "on their own", not with an outside group that affects the results more dramatically every year, as the site shrinks. As nice as it is that SOTAC tries to be gracious toward team loyalists and give them ample credit for their successes, that doesn't change the mathematics of the situation. Even on a medium-sized team like Meridell, SOTAC's own scores were consistently higher than the rest of Meridell's members who posted on the boards. They may not feel or act this way, but SOTAC is almost always what pushes teams over the top, and they inevitably get most of the credit for the end result. Meridell and plenty of SOTAC's other team choices have been strong on their own, yes, but even if people want to believe that they could've/would've won without SOTAC, it's impossible to know.<br><br>Beyond that, people who don't like SOTAC just feel that they go against the spirit of the event and make it less fun and interesting. The results are essentially decided from day one, especially in recent years. Unless there's a spectacularly strong, small team, or intervention from TNT, SOTAC or the ACG will almost always win – and even if they lose, there's usually suspicion of foul play.<br><br>With all of that said, I don't think they're breaking any rules by joining a team together, and there are certainly other, bigger issues that undermine the event. It might not sound like it, but there's significantly less tension between SOTAC and the greater AC community these days. </p></div>
<div id="question"><b>What can TNT do to minimize the impact of ACGs without being too transparent and opening the cup up to further manipulation?</b><p>I think all TNT can do to try to mitigate the impact of cheating is to re-implement interactive captchas, probably? But I'm not naïve enough to think that there's no way the ACG would get through those too. They could add something like a "loyalty bonus" for people who don't switch teams every year to mitigate the impact of ASGs, but I'm sure that would be controversial, and I don't trust TNT to get it right.<br><br>I don't think there's much left to reveal about how the AC works. The whole system isn't terribly complicated, and most teams/dedicated players are aware of how to play "optimally" at this point. There's just only so much players can do, and I don't think any of the teams are, like, overbearing about playing super hard or getting upset with people for not doing enough, these days… which is good, to be clear, haha.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Can TNT rectify this situation? What would that look like, concretely?</b><p>They can't undo all the damage here – I think the AC is irreparably harmed by something like this. They had made the Cup better for a few years in a row, earning some (cautious) trust, then they fumbled in a big way last year. I think this year was their chance to make up for that and get back on track, and they failed to do so. As I said, I think they desperately need to cancel the event at this point. Still, there are a few things they could do that would help.</p><ul><li>Acknowledge the farcical results as a (big) mistake, and adjust the results. Meridell won, Virtupets should keep 2nd, and Brightvale should be 3rd, etc. (There were other issues with results too, but I don't want to go through all of it here.)</li><li>Address the fact that so many users were "shadow banned" from contributing to their teams. So far, we've only gotten a single ticket response from support denying that anyone is banned – and even if that's true, I definitely don't think that's an acceptable means of "announcing" anything.</li><li>Be better about communication and transparency in the future. I think every single Neopets player can agree that TNT has done an awful job of communicating with players for, like, forever. It's ridiculous how consistently bad they've been about (not) communicating with and listening to users. It's unfortunate that upper management doesn't seem to care that forcing match-three games and Metaverse disasters are not what anyone wants from Neopets.</li></ul></div>
<div id="question"><b>All of your suggestions on fixing the cup generally speaking alter aspects of the existing paradigm. What are your thoughts on a more dramatic overhaul that reworked the cup / added to it as a mechanism to pull in that disinterested cohort?</b><p>Over the years, I've mostly advocated for things that I thought would make the event more fair, or more interesting in a competitive sense, but that's definitely not the only approach. I'm just not super creative, honestly – I'm open to more drastic changes for sure. There are still people who are enthusiastic about the Cup "as it is", but that crowd is dwindling as the years go by. I think ideas like Robbie's "battlepass"-style concept, or Herdy's suggestion of "Food Club-like" bets on daily matches would be great. I think changing things even more fundamentally, like replacing the event with something more plot-like and less grindy would breathe some life into the site. Particularly if TNT can find a way to maintain the team aspect of the event, I really don't think many people would be upset by more extreme changes. 
</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>You've now advocated multiple times for TNT simply cancelling the cup, at least for next year. Is it possible that desire is in any way a knee-jerk response fueled by short term frustration? If TNT announced they were cancelling the cup moving forward, how do you think you would feel given your extensive involvement? </b><p>Fair question – I imagine that at least some people might be surprised to see me speak so negatively about the event. Part of it is an emotional response to the last two years, yeah. A lot of us are very upset about the results and the (alleged) shadow bans, and that's an ongoing situation – although TNT might disagree with me on that – so it's hard to think positively about the next iteration of the event right now. But I do think these mistakes are going to have an effect on how people approach things next year, even if they're eventually acknowledged or even resolved. It would certainly feel strange not to come back next June and pour a bunch of time and energy into this event, though. I don't take the Cup as seriously as I used to for myriad reasons, and the last couple of years have been rough, but I do think it will be hard to let it go whenever the time comes. Despite all the issues over the years, it's been a big part of our lives, along with Neopets as a whole.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>I'm roughly defining committed participants as people rank 10+ for this question. Per neo_truths ~2500 users put a relatively high amount of effort into this past AC. Maybe 25-40% of those users are active on the boards (some potentially significant % of the remaining proportion are shells though ig). Do you think that silent group shares the sentiments being expressed on the boards? Is it possible there's a silent majority that doesn't care as much about standings?</b><p>Oh yeah, I think that's almost certainly the case, honestly. Even among people who participate quite a bit, there are a lot of people who just want prizes. While I have seen some complaints about the prize shop, it was certainly more profitable than ever for players this year (although I know that upset some people who didn't play, too). I don't think there are all that many people who care too much about the results, which is totally fair. But even if they don't, I do think most are upset about things getting shaken up in such a nonsensical way, if only on behalf of people they might know who care more about that side of things.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>That actually feeds into my next question. Last I checked 3 of the prizes are worth ~40m each. Arguably that's a very powerful incentive for users who only casually interact with the AC/even for existing players, or to retain interest for users disillusioned by the competitive aspect. Do you think TNT intended to create such valuable prizes? Do you think these kinds of prizes will offset people's frustration at all?</b><p>Yeah, I think the prize shop will make more casual players play as much as they can for that reason alone. Many players who are upset right now will be back next year, inevitably, and the prize shop may affect that decision for them, too. It will undoubtedly incentivize people to play illegitimately to get more prize points as well, which could be, uh, interesting too. I generally love that prizes are worth more; it's great for everyone other than stamp collectors who don't want to play the games, I guess? But no, I honestly don't think TNT knew what they were doing. It's possible, but in the vast majority of cases over the last decade or so, they've tried to make site rewards more accessible and easy for everyone. The AC has always been an exception to that rule, but it's hard for me to imagine that they thought all that much about it, given their handling of everything else.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>You've shared some stats from neo_truths before and expressed you think their insights are correct. If I'm reading their recent "release" right then per their cheater-detection methodology they're seeing numbers of illegitimate players shockingly similar to what TNT found.<br><br>(1) Were you shadow banned? (2) Do you maintain that the shadow bans are generally inaccurate, or at minimum have too many false positives?</b><p>First, to appease the skeptics: I can't be 100% sure that neo_truths is correct about everything he has said, I don't know his motives, and I'm not super knowledgeable on the technical side of things, even if I know a lot about the AC itself. Not trying to claim infallibility for neo_truths (or myself).<br><br>Still, his statements about the AC have generally aligned with the community's understanding of the event (based on AC history, statements from TNT over the years, etc.), and I know several active Cup players have helped him understand the event better. Unless I've missed something, I haven't seen him claiming anything about the AC that was like... terribly surprising, or suspiciously divergent from what we've known about the event, etc. (Some of the explanations he has given in his posts have been pretty confusing though, admittedly.)<br><br>But anyway, regarding the shadow ban situation: TNT started using this system  - or at least a precursor to it - back in 2016, and there were plenty of false positives back then too. It's only so shocking because we assumed (or hoped) that TNT had learned from that. Also, exposing the bans created more work for neo_truths, since he ended up replying to lots of individuals asking about their status. Even if you're unconvinced about neo_truths or question his motives, this particular claim isn't all that surprising or farfetched. I was banned, along with many other "team leaders", and as I mentioned earlier, KI's ban list... did not inspire confidence in TNT's methods, to say the least.<br><br>I don't know exactly what criteria neo_truths used to try to detect illegitimate players, but I'm not at all surprised that there's so little overlap with whatever TNT did. I'm sure his list is imperfect too - if you're careful enough, it's not really possible to confirm something like that completely. But yeah, I can't overstate how inadequate TNT's ban list appears to be... and the fact that it doesn't even have a clear correlation with the bizarre results makes the whole thing even more bewildering.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Do you have any thoughts on why ACGs exist? There's no reward for getting #1, you can often identify the people that keep joining cheating teams on their main each year, and it ruins the game being fun for others. What do you think their goal is?</b><p>Yeah, I don't really know, and I've never spent much time on their forums or whatever, so I can only speculate. I'm sure there are different reasons for different people in the group. A lot of them may just dislike the games and want prize points without all the effort. Some of them are probably angry with JS/TNT over how the site is run and want to sabotage things for them. Maybe some of them do it because they like feeling powerful or whatever. I've also heard that some of them dislike SOTAC and don't believe that they're legit players (even if I dislike SOTAC too, I've seen no evidence of that beyond a few specific users, for what it's worth). It's a kind of community, too, so they may just like "participating" together, even if there's no real reward if they end up winning. I obviously don't agree with it and don't entirely "get it", but I can imagine a lot of different reasons for doing it/trying to justify it.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>One of the reasons the AC prizes are so valuable is b/c of NP item inflation and people wanting to park their NPs somewhere they think the value will appreciate. Do you think inflation is an issue with the current meta / do you have thoughts on how TNT can address it?</b><p>Releasing such a powerful weapon along with three stamps in the AC prize shop would have led to higher prices regardless, but they wouldn't be as expensive without so many rich resellers buying things up. It's not entirely a bad thing in this case – it's nice that players are able to make more NP than usual from the AC – but inflation is a big problem in my opinion, yeah.<br><br>I'm not an expert on any of this, but I think the main issue is that there's just too much NP around. If someone doesn't care about album items, isn't interested in high-end BD items, and/or doesn't have a particularly expensive, permanent collection of some kind, they're never really "losing" anything when they buy items. Even if a reseller or "investor" is temporarily holding items that lose value for some reason, they can always wait for prices to rebound. (And especially these days, plenty of users are so rich that they still have essentially unlimited funds even if they do spend a lot on items that they actually keep.)<br><br>There are tons of issues with the Neopets economy, and I don't think there's a real way to "fix" all of it. Still, I think it would help if we had a major "NP sink" – something that takes a significant amount of NP out of circulation (rather than it just changing hands). I'm not sure what that should look like exactly, but if rich users had something else to spend their NP on, in a way that didn't just pass the NP to other rich users, I think that would go a long way.<br><br>The smug disregard that some users show for more casual players for being "lazy" on Neopets in 2022 is a bad look – maybe 10 or 15 years ago I could understand that kind of attitude, but not now. As an AC player (who has also dabbled in reselling), I understand that effort and hard work can add value to people's experiences on Neopets, but that's not the only way to approach the site. Plus, no one is forced to buy up items, ask for crazy prices, etc., no matter how much NP they may have – it's a choice, and people don't "hate themselves" for finding that frustrating.<br><br>With that said, I do understand that some people don't want to stop growing their Neopets wealth just because they've hit max bank or whatever, and those kinds of users need things that can occupy their time and NP without impacting other users so much. Again, not an expert, and I haven't though too deeply about the specifics, but a few possibilities that I've thought about or heard around the boards/servers: an NP sink similar to the old "Save the Wheels" event; a much more costly variant of the Wheel of Extravagance; or something like the Hidden Tower for really high-end (and perhaps no-trade) items or even avatars or other perks.</p></div>

<div class="title_caption">HST reformer, guild co-founder, 20+ year player / July 18th, 2022</div>

<div id="question"><b>Can you tell me a little about your time and experiences on Neo?</b><p>For sure! Well, wee little Kay made her account on Oct 7, 2000 at the prompting of her beloved sister. We played for a few months and she kicked my butt, like she figured out she could collect neggs and resell them and I was like, economics whomst? I was a geeky teen. Sometime in early 2001 I stopped playing until I went to college. There, in 2004, I met this super cute nerd named Eric. He was confided in me one day, do you play neopets? And I was like, oh dang, I have an account and he was like, wow that's an old account. Do you want to collect avatars or battle? And the rest is history, like I fully committed to avatar collecting, quite happily, while he committed to battling. Incidentally, we also committed to each other and have been together ever since. We married in 2011 and now have two kiddos upon whom I hope to inflict neopets someday. From 2004 until I quit in 2010 I made avatar collecting and championing my main thing. I honed my gaming sk!lls as much as I could, participated in all events, etc. Anything to get those avvies! I left the site in 2010 after being majorly hacked and took 6 years away from the site. My guildmates, dear friends of mine who had attended my wedding, brought me back and I'm very grateful. Their steadfast friendship and our inexplicable bond over this very broken site has sustained me through some tough times. These days I'm mostly just trying to make the site a lil easier for newcomers which is not altruistic. I fully understand that if I want Neopets to continue to exist, it needs to bring on new players, and I think there's ways to do that doesn't involve NFTs... </p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Nice! You mentioned focusing on making the site easier for newcomers. Can you elaborate on the ways you do that?</b><p>The site has been around for so so long I think the barrier to entry is very real. Like yes TNT has done a good job with newbie starter packs and the intro screen is bright. But uh, where do you go from there? And if you do take the time to deep dive into JN and other guides, what would compel someone to stick around Neo these days? It sure isn't the battledome.  People get into customisation and pet trading, and some get into avatar collecting. And one of the ways to mark achievements in avatar collecting is by getting on the Neoboard Avatar Collector High Score Table. At the end of every month, I make a board on the Avatar Chat and ask top collectors to wait until the 2nd day of the next month to give newer collectors a chance at the Top 50 slots during the reset. Each month is variably successful, but we usually have least 2-3 new collectors. ^^ Without people waiting, and with the tremendous amount of retired avatars in circulation, it would be impossible for anyone who's joined in the last few years to make it onto the HST. We regularly have people getting the Avvie Collector avatar who have been around since the mid-2000s.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Do you have any ballpark idea of how effective your board has been? Have you noticed the 50th HST slot decline relatively due to it?</b><p>The 50th slot fluctuates a bit month to month, just based on the day of the reset (weekdays tend to have lower reset numbers, although last month was over a holiday weekend and it was quite low! that was a pleasant surprise), events (for awhile there the CC was awarding avatars on the 1st which pushed the count slightly higher), etc. The most recent data I have is:<br><br>Q. What was the lowest score last month?<br>A. 345 Previously: 354, 341, 340, 341, 343<br><br>On April 1 anyone active got an avatar that day. Hence the 354, was a doozy.<br><br>The truth is probably that my board helps very little in actually suppressing the score. What it does always do is remind newer and returning players that someone cares about their hard work and achievements.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>That's a pretty cool approach. I've noticed your board also has a neat community of users with high avatar counts that stop by and cheer newcomers on. Have you ever had a chat with the users who are less supportive and consistently reset on day 1?</b><p>Yes, I'm deeply grateful for everyone else who makes the reset boards a success! It really is a community effort. Most of the very top collectors, like the people who 400+ avatars, do wait to reset. And yes, I've had conversations with several consistent resetters over the years. Some of those convos I would characterize as straight up hostile. Others reset because the extrinsic value of being on the HST (or, more commonly, keeping others off the HST) is more valuable to them than the intrinsic value of the achievement itself, e.g. that they collected enough avatars to make the Top 50. I try to be empathic to people but I think it's really, really hard in 2022 to base your argument for staying on the HST on privilege. Because it is a privilege to have an older account with retired avatars.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Can you clarify the difference b/w the extrinsic and intrinsic values? I'm struggling a bit with identifying the difference.</b><p>So the extrinsic value is the spot on the HST, the visibility to other people. The assumption that by being on the HST other people admire you and that makes being on the HST more elite, therefore you are more elite.<br><br>The intrinsic value is simply that you are proud of your own achievements for yourself. Like getting the Avatar Collector avatar (or a trophy) has value because you worked hard and accomplished the thing for you, not for anyone else.<br><br>The difference in how someone feels about the achievements comes up a lot, mostly when people complain to me, "but newer players didn't have to work as hard as I did to get on the HST, so I'm going to stay on the HST so they have to work harder." To which I say... uh, no. Your hardwork is valid. You still did that work. Be proud of it and move on. xD That someone else achieves the same thing through different means and different work does not devalue another player's achievement (except in their own mind).</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Do you think exclusivity or rareness isn't really possible to value personally? There's always an external showmanship aspect involved?</b><p>That is a super interesting question!</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>We can talk about it within the confines of Neo, or if we wanna get super deep, touch on other contexts. I don't have an answer myself for sure!</b><p>For sure, yep, I think for my life in general... I'd answer differently? Maybe? I'll have to think more about it. For Neopets: since it is a game and most achievements are public, there is inevitably some showmanship involved. Certainly wrt avatars, like, we use avatars on the Neoboards. For me I think of them more like art than accomplishment but I definitely understand other people feeling differently about that. And I do admire people who have extremely rare avatars (thinking of the few people the Neopia Central avvie) who don't post much and hardly ever change their avatar. I think it is possible to value the exclusivity of thing without being very showy, yes, but since it is a game... some showmanship is warranted.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>That's actually what I was going to ask next -- showmanship and exclusivity of achievements in games are a really common, generally non-controversial thing. You mentioned people's hard work isn't devalued by other's achieving a similar goal with a different approach. What about the wow factor of an avatar? Doesn't that get devalued? And is it fair to want to preserve that?</b><p>I like that - the wow factor! And there is that for some avatars to be sure. But that's also changed over time. When I was trying to be lent SuAP in the mid-2000s it was nuts. I had to leverage my Stamp Collector - Haunted Woods stamps (before I stuck 'em in my album) just to be lent. And I'd already achieved Neoboard Avatar Collector! After that I convinced my lender to relax his super strict guidelines and a lot more people got SuAP, even before it settled around 100M (a development I'm happy with). I think the argument that SuAP is a more common avatar today is absolutely true. Is it less valuable? I don't know. I don't really love it as an art aesthetic. xD So to me the value hasn't changed. My favorite avatar is Stamp Collector - Haunted Woods. This spring TNT released a boatload more STS. I had hoped that would mean we'd have more SCHWs around but I haven't seen many. If everyone, today, could just unlock SCHW as a clickable, would it be less wow? Absolutely. Obviously some work towards stamp collecting would be great. But that would still be better than it being straight up impossible for newer players (prior to the STS release). For me, the art of that STS on the avatar is the most compelling thing and I just love to stare at it all day long. And I know how hard I worked to achieve it... I think that's good enough for me but I recognize that I'm the exception there, rather than the rule.
</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>I want to backtrack a little bit - you mentioned that some of the responses you'v gotten from people who reset have been hostile. Can you share what that's looked like?</b><p>Yeah, sadly. I'm smarter now in that I don't poke the bear, so to speak. I don't actively reach out to the people who have a gold trophy and reset anyhow. When I did reach out, several years ago now, I got responses like, "it's none of your business," "your board just reminds me to reset on the 1st so keep making it!" and "why should I help anyone else when no one helped me?". The last of which I remember distinctly and wanting to write back and go, oh, so you bought your own SUAP, MSPP, BGC? Which nowadays people can but mostly folks get lent those, and all the pet avatars, etc.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Changing subjects a little - you mentioned it's a privilege to have an older account. Can you elaborate on that? Isn't account creation date something the user causes? Most people on Neopets today are probably adults that have had internet access for decades; we all had equal opportunity to create an account at any point in the last decade or more, probably.</b><p>When I say account age privilege in this case I mean: how the power structures on Neopets aid older accounts. You can see this plainly in food club which pays older accounts more nps which then can be used for investments or stamps for avatars, further privileging those accounts. And I think that's a fair point, that people could have heard about Neopets or decided to return with a new account sooner. I'm not arguing that older accounts shouldn't have some benefits. I love the updated badges. But that new, enthusiastic players can't unlock retired avatars to increase their count to get on the HST just because they weren't around one day in 2005 bothers me. I'm not sure myself if I would really advocate for re releasing retired avatars. I think Greg's idea of having retired avvies be non-counts for the HST is worth some exploration. </p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Can you explain what differentiates benefits you're okay with from others?</b><p>I feel I have a firm grasp in my heart about what the difference is but I'm having a harder time delineating it. Like, any new player could eventually achieve the same account age badge I have. My having it doesn't prevent anyone else from getting it (assuming the site survives another 20 years). Whereas occupying a slot on the HST does prevent someone else from achieving the same thing I have (the avatar or a trophy). Does that make sense? I don't want or need newer players to do zero work for the achievements, I just want the achievements to be actually possible.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>You talked really fondly about your guild above, and mentioned that you even had your guildmates at your wedding. That seems really special. How did you get involved in your guild? What are your favorite things about it?</b><p>Aww cute, love this question!! My guild is Omneo and I founded it along with a rather (in)famous ACer, Zia (noob). We recruited our good friends and had pretty high reqs for a long time. We really focused on players who seemed to care deeply about the game without being jerks. Like our goal was never to be the most elite but rather to foster community amongst folks who were equally obsessed. And it worked! I think I had 8? Neopians at my wedding including Zia and Kelly (paintedpeophin) in our bridal party. I'm hoping to attend the wedding of a guildmate this fall actually. Now that we are adults we actually have found more points of connection as we try to make sense of the world. We've also de-emphasized the structure of the guild, like we have a council still but it's super relaxed and we mostly just chat and encourage each other to play the Altador Cup because TNT might release a stamp-- or four!!! 
</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>That's incredible! It's cool how Neopets can influence our real lives in meaningful ways.<br><br>Oddly, that feeds in a little to my next question regarding the inverse: real life impacting Neopets. Probably one of the most tangible ways this occurs is when users purchase NC with real money. When we first connected for this interview you mentioned you had some ideas to rework the NC economy to make it less prone to instability and manipulation. Can you elaborate on what you meant by that?
</b><p>Oh boy. I may not have the solution! There are economists on Neo who could propose better solutions. But what I would like to see is an open marketplace, like a TP or shops, for NC items. In the past TNT has said that wasn't legally feasible but like, so many other games allow user to user trades via their marketplace, and I believe you can at least buy other user's content. By making us pay a shipment tax (GBC) on every transaction, and making those transactions private between users, the market is not free and open. There's no way to track trades so people are incentived to manipulate the market to their benefit, e.g. only report the trades that raise the value of their own items. Not everyone does that of course, but it's not a free market economy. A good example of the instability is a post that came up today. The author argued that people should discount the value of Candles because they are 150NC and GBCs (the base unit of the NC economy) are 200NC. What that fails to recognize is the shipment tax is by volume (e.g. you always need to use boxes in discreet increments of 1, you can't use 3/4ths of a box for a candle that costs 3/4ths of a GBC). Also, you aren't really trading the Candle, right? You're trading to gamble on the items, and imo the items inside a Candle are probably on average as valuable as items from a 200NC cap. So I really don't think there is any difference. But! You know what would be a FAR more fair way to determine the real value of a 150NC Candle? Allow us to trade directly with other users. The market would naturally determine the correct value. </p></div>
<div id="question"><b>I'm trying to understand the specific scenario you're calling out a little better: so the author said that 1 GBC is worth more than 1 Candle?</b><p>Exactly. So for 600 NC she would take either 3 GBCs or 4 Candles, And like if you just gave her 600 NC that makes sense but she wanted more Candles for something worth 3 GBCs.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Got it - and the issue had is that it would be 4 candles + 4 boxes used, vs 3 GBCs + 3 boxes used?</b><p>Exactly! Like if we say Mac's Glasses (NC) are valued on OWLS at 3 GBCs, she wanted someone to give her 4 Candles (using 4boxes) for them instead
</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>And sentiment was generally against this user?</b><p>It was mixed! Like very mixed. It was super interesting discussion.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Neat! I'll check it out. Before we dive into the content of what you mentioned above, I've got another clarifying question: can you clarify what you meant by "in the past TNT has said that wasn't legally feasible [to create a market for NC items]"? Did you mean a market using fiat, NP, or NC? All three would be illegal to trade for an NC item?</b><p>That's right, that's what we were told back in like the late 00s after NC became a thing. I haven't asked this TNT what they think about an NC marketplace. They said it was illegal (now they could have meant against their TOS, I was too young to dig into it then) for users to buy NC items directly from each other. The only way to exchange NC items is by "gifting" which is why we use GBCs...</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Ok (now that I understand all of that) there's a lot to unpack in your message above, but to start, it sounds like the problem is that private trades lead to less transparency, making market manipulation easier. You also mentioned a few times that a freer market here would help determine the "correct" value.<br><br>There are a lot of situations where markets and the price discovery process don't work as we expect, though. Monopolies are probably one of the most well-known instances of market failure. If you remove the logistical barriers to cornering an item's market that currently exist (private trades requires reaching out to everyone individually, using the box "tax" you mentioned, etc.) then couldn't HTF items become exponentially more difficult to find if someone chooses to inflate prices?</b><p>100% this. We've seen that this week in the NP economy, with certain groups and guilds coordinating to massively inflate unpopular but HTF items (iykyk). While it's harder to do that with the NC economy I don't think it's immune to the potential for that level of manipulation. It boggles my mind that things like the MiniMME: Space Exploration BG is worth ~100GBC these days. I traded for two of them for permanent customs just a few years ago for ~30GBC each. A +100% increase year over year doesn't seem sustainable to me. I do appreciate that TNT is trying to re-release some of the older very rare items. There also seems to be a cap of about 300GBC value for any given item. But that's still bonkers and I'm not convinced most very high value items are worth more than $100USD. Or maybe they're worth even more! And we just don't know it because it's onerous to trade box by box by box.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Sorry, maybe I wasn't clear - I was basically asking: if you remove the need to use boxes and individually contact users to organize trades and instead create user shops/a TP for NC items, wouldn't it become extremely easy for someone to buy up an item and artificially inflate its value?</b><p>That's interesting. To do that you'd have to be a whale... I suppose that is possible! And a scary thought (mostly that anyone has that much IRL money). I had not thought of the boxes as a prevention against that sort of manipulation. Fascinating.<br><br>Okay having thought about that more, for me I would still rather change things for the greater good ( a more stable NC economy) rather than keep using gift boxes because of some nefarious actors. I'd also hope that TNT would intervene if people were trying to artificially manipulate the economy but since they've so far declined to do so with the NP shenanigans, I guess that's a limited hope.
</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>You mentioned this would have to be done by whales, but when you consider how scarce certain popular NC items are, it seems more possible given the amount of money already flying around. Huge hypothetical, but here's an example:<br><br>Black Friday GBCs cost $1. If you buy your NC in the mall in bulk, you get 140NC/$1. That means that technically, it would cost ~$71 per Space Exploration BG in terms of BF GBCs, so I'm going to use $71 as the fiat value. How many Space Exploration BGs actually change hands per month? It's roughly 1-2 per month, if we treat Owl's data as a source of truth. Some of those BGs are actually the same one being retraded, not new ones entering into circulation from SDBs/closets, etc. <b>TL;DR:</b> If you kept an eye out on available lots, you could pretty rapidly corner the market for Space Exploration BGs with just a couple hundred dollars, which isn't an abnormal amount for people to drop on NC.<br><br>This whole process becomes way, way easier for items worth 10-20 GBC which trade at a low volume, particularly for items that are less popular. What kind of steps do you think TNT can take to prevent this scenario?</b><p>In the above scenario I think continuing to re-release items - and I would advocate that all items are available in various retired caps - would help to mitigate that. Also, when people try to manipulate the economy, be it NP or NC, they need to be warned explicitly against doing so, and if that warning isn't heeded, frozen. It's both making items available for the vast majority of legitimate players and punishing nefarious actors.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Pivoting a bit here because I think what you just said is really interesting - do you think single individuals buying up an NP item should be against the rules?</b><p>Yes, I do.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Just to set some context, can I ask how frequently you trade NC, or whether you're involved in reselling at all?</b><p>I trade NC pretty frequently! I don't often make boards any more unless I'm desperately seeking a certain item for a permanent custom. But I do maybe 2-3 neomail trades a week mostly because people from my tradelist on DTI and reach out. ^^ They're usually small trades, like things from my 2:1GBC list. As for reselling, you mean like NP? No. I do often buy investments, like AC stamps, and hold them for a few years. When I resell them it's because I want to buy something, like a stamp for an avatar or yesterday I bought a Royal Candychan for my Candy Kau. I would say I sell things from my SDB maybe once a quarter to raise funds for a specific purchase.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Why do you think it should be against the rules for an individual user to buy up a single item?</b><p>Because I think it's deeply unfair. I feel like I should have a more technical explanation for that, but most of my time on the site these days is spent trying to level the field for newer, returning, and dedicated older players who for whatever reason haven't been as successful. When one person gains a monopoly on an item, that makes the game less fun for everyone else.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>You're super consistent on wanting to generally make the site more fun for a majority of users - are there any areas where you secretly think the intense level of competition is fun?</b><p>Haha, SUCH a good question! I don't actually consider myself a competitive person. That's one of the reasons I really like Neo is that it can be so cooperative. I had to borrow a ton of pets, petpets, items, etc. to collect as many avatars as I have, and in return I've tried to give back. That's so cool! My favorite non-Neo game is Pandemic, same idea. I'd rather work against a game board than against other players. That said, in the past I have gotten super into the Altador Cup (when I was young and could spend many hours a day playing) and I do love the Games Challenges. I wish things like the Customisation Spotlight were more competitive but it truly seems so random who wins? or maybe that the pool of entrants is so deep and so anonymous that I can't get into it. But I was really competing for that first Customisation Spotlight award back in the day. I do love dressing up my pets!</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Do you have a favorite customization you'd be willing to share?</b><p>Squee, of course! <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=Metaphunk">This one</a> won gold a few years back and it's summer themed, to boot!
</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Last subject I wanted to touch on - this has been a strangely tumultuous week at Neopets. First, the AC results didn't turn out as we'd expected, and neo_truths revealed that TNT had likely messed up the results in a significant way. Then, we find out someone with neo_truths' level of access is selling our account credentials for ~$100 thousand. You've been around on Neo for 2+ decades, and Neo has been through some crazy times. Is this weeks' craziness different than some of the other challenging moments in Neopets' history?</b><p>It has really been quite the rollercoaster this week! For me other really challenging moments in Neo history include the introduction of NFTs, or really the first announcement of Neocash (omg have I come around on that one...). Both of those really upset me, as does the sale of our account credentials. I will say that even though this week has been challenging, I'm deeply grateful that the current TNT staff feels more like the staff of the early 00s, like they are trying to communicate, to understand, to make a difference when and where they can. I think this TNT's hands are more tied because of the corporate structure than the 00s TNT and so I try to be more patient and understanding. But uh, it would be great if our accounts were actually secure!</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Was there anything else you wanted to touch on or add?
</b><p>I think we pretty thoroughly covered my main two vents on the site. Thank you for hearing me out! I really do love Neopets.com and I'm always mulling ways to make it better. One last shout out to my Omneons -- to the end.</p></div>

<div class="title_caption">Guide-runner, restocker, lurker / July 8th, 2022</div>

<div id="question"><b>First things first, you're a member of a team runing the NC Value Guide (<a href="//www.neopets.com/~Owls">Owls</a>). Could you  explain what that is?</b><p>Owls is a guide that assigns values to Neocash items in terms of GBCs. It's used by users to check item values when trading NC.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>NC trading is probably one of the highest stakes activities in the game, because it's the only in-game economy where every single transaction is founded in real world cash. By choosing the mechanism that helps items get their values, you're influencing how people spend their paychecks.<br><br>How does your team integrate with the community to ensure that the guide is truly beneficial to users, and how do you ensure the guide isn't influenced by opportunists?</b><p>I'm actually really excited to answer this question because I think it'll be soooo informative for people to really get an understanding on how the Owls team operates, but before I do that I would like to say and remind everyone that we receive no monetary or other compensation for doing this, no one on the team does. We're all volunteers using our free time to do all of this solely because we want a guide! After waka announced it was no longer updating, we (the original Owls, only two of which are still working on it: Azura and myself) decided, "Hey, we could do that" and the page was born!<br><br>You're right, Neocash is probably the highest-risk part of this site. Even with the free items received from site events et cetera, people who are actively trading Neocash have bought the pure NC and used it to purchase items and traded them around, and it ain't cheap either! Americans are blessed with probably the best or one of the best rates of USD to NC, but of all the countries that NC is available for purchase in some aren't so lucky. There are quite a few people who rely on annual mall sales, etc., to get the most bang for their buck so to speak, or just trade small items that they got in events. This of course only makes NC trading more dicey. That money that you spend to buy NC, you won't get back. That's why the Owls team wants... no NEEDS.... to give the best and most accurate data we can not only to save traders from bad deals but also to keep trading alive!<br><br>We're constantly trying to stay in touch with the community and the main way way that we do that is by trying to ALWAYS have a board up and on the main page for traders to use to not only report trades but also to request value checks for items! After reports come in, we add them in to our massive spreadsheet and then they are counted line-by-line and item-by-item and then the number of reports is added up, and each item that has four or more reports will get a value. As for opportunists, we won't assign a value to items that have inconsistent value reports, we'll wait for more reports in order to determine a fair average value range for each item. </p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Taking a big step back for a second...Guide aside, what do you spend most of your time on neo doing?</b><p>Restocking and lurking [the NC]</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Why lurk those boards?</b><p>Either looking to see if there's a board made by someone I know, seeing if anyone is seeking something(s) that I have, or bumping Owls boards</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Do you trade NC actively?</b><p>I don't, no. I mostly just do small trades in severs, etc. where I see a friend wanting something -- usually something they're going to use and keep.
</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Do you think not trading NC actively impacts your ability to run the guide?</b><p>No, and in some ways it helps the guide too. By the guide's "face" (and by that I mean the account holding the pet Owls) I see so much more than I used to on the NCC. I see nearly every trade reported to us, either by adding the reports to our spreadsheet, doing value checks, or assigning values, and in some ways that keeps me feeling as if I'm trading alongside everyone. I see the value trends and things when I'm lurking boards or shuffles too so its like I still am trading in a way heehee. Plus keeping up a solo board to find trades is too time consuming nowadays that I could be spending doing other Owls things or my own site goals!</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>What % of the community would you say takes the time to report trades? Really rough estimates accepted.</b><p>Not nearly as many people are active on the NCC as in recent years, or on the site at all for that matter. Of those that still trade actively, I would guess about maybe a third of them have reported at least one trade. That number dwindles significantly when you think about how many trades happen daily, so we're only getting a small portion of the info we could be getting. That being said, if we consider that we average the reports that we do get and don't assign "new" values to items that have inconsistent value reports, these few reports we do get can usually be generalized to reflect the whole. I'd also like to take the opportunity here to say thank you to all who have reported to us, your continued support is immeasurable and so so so so SO appreciated, thank you!!!!</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>How do you define "inconsistent"? Is it something that varies on a case-by-case basis?</b><p>By inconsistent I mean, yes, case by case basis, but it also just means inconsistent from each other. I won't name an item because I don't want to be accused of anything, but imagine if an item has reports of, I don't know... 3-4, 6-8, 8-10, and 25, that would be inconsistent. Usually they aren't that wild but it's just an example! Usually they are closer together such as a few 2-3s and a 6-8 or 8 added in, in which case we would usually wait before assigning a value at four+ reports up to see if we get a fifth that matches the original 2-3s or is higher, indicating a higher trend, or maybe the outstanding numbers are much lower like maybe the item has been rereleased or something!</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>How do you balance transparency in the process with having to watch what you can disclose to avoid accusations? Also, what do those accusations look like when they do happen?</b><p>The balance here is a very grey tightrope above the yooyuball field. We try to maintain transparency by offering those value checks you've probably seen on our trade report boards, as well as other searchable options. Of course, since we don't see every trade report, it's hard to reach a totally and irrevocably accurate value to every single item, even those that are so small or rare that they haven't even been traded this year. We'll probably always get accusations of fixing values, et cetera because of this, and there's nothing we can really do about it except explain our process over and over to remain as transparent as possible without posting our spreadsheet link.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>What do you mean by searchable options?</b><p>When I say searchable I mean it literally! A few of our lovely lovely LOVELY friends have created a bot that allows users in my server to search through the Owls database for reports specific to an item, and can even report trades that way! It's a hugely popular feature that doesn't get nearly enough praise as it should. The Owls team is considering a site too, where we would try to implement that feature as well in some capacity.<br><br>As far as the spreadsheet, we actually have uhhh a few..... The first one ran up quite a file size as it had 16,574 rows of pure trade data as well as other staff stuff like notes for counting the rows etc! It was becoming a pain for our old PCs, lol. We recently started a new sheet and it's currently up to almost a thousand rows!!</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>What % of traders active on the NC use your guide, even if it's just for a reference point?</b><p>I'd like to say that it's 100%, but it's probably somewhere in the 90s? Since we decided to start from scratch (instead of just copying Waka's values and then editing from there), our page is still missing values for a LOT of items, which isn't anything we can control other than hope we get a ton of reports on every item right now! <i>dreams happily</i> Unfortunately this also means that traders are largely unable to use us for values on items that have no info, BUT the NC community is abundant with resources that things like value check boards, old guides, ratios, etc. can also help determine a fair value or range when we can't provide any info!</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>You mentioned that only 2 of the original team members are still around. Are there any general reasons people tend to leave?</b><p>Mostly because of availability issues. It is a lot of work to do on top of whatever someone is doing for actual Real Life Paying Job as well as families, etc. so while we still love and talk to nearly all of the former Owls, they are very much appreciated still!
</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>How many hours do you and your team put in a week on average?</b><p>This I'm not sure I can actually give an answer! We actually just adopted a bunch of new team members! We're up to 18 (!!!!!) people working on Owls right now. Each of us is working at some point or another on an aspect of the project. You'll probably notice the same couple people on the boards but many of us work in the background on data entry and an4lysis, so its really hard to assume a specific number of hours for how many people we have currently.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>What are the biggest challenges in NC trading currently? You mentioned solo-NC trading is time-consuming, can you expand on that?</b><p>I think the biggest challenge in NC trading hmmmmmm I think would probably be the sheer number of items and the rarity of some of them is just wild. Think of it like trying to trade for a pet you want; most of them are probably on old, abandoned accounts or just plain frozen! Those that have the item you want too might either want to hold onto it in their own closet too or even a gallery or maybe they want to trade it only for something equally as rare! It's like Antiques Roadshow out there! I mentioned solo-boarding being time-consuming just because of how long it might actually take you to find a single item. Maybe you'll get lucky and find it on page 4 of your first board, maybe you won't find it for months and give up. That's partially why I love NC shuffles (think silent auction?) so much, older items come out of the woodwork and give people a quick-paced way to trade items they might not have found with just a solo board and a tradelist.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Is there anything you think TNT can do to improve the current state of NC trading?</b><p>I'd like there to be more TNT-hosted boards on the ncc. They have been much more receptive recently and asking about which dyeworks people want in each season and things like that but I think if they really want to keep trading alive they need to ask what the traders really want and deliver it!</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Do you generally approve of how TNT handles re-releases?</b><p>Overall, yes. some rereleases I am not a total fan of, like the baby retired caps for example that come out nearly on the dot yearly for the past few years. It's all but demolished baby item values and rarities, but then again it does make those items significantly easier to find, though I'd rather they cycle through other categories like older NC mall games like patapult that the items have never been rereleased, rather than repeating the same capsules which have nearly the same item pools as the years-prior.</p></div>

<div class="title_caption">
 Long-time JN staffer, Neopets conservationist, and <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Scroggs">Metaverse critic</a> / June 7th, 2022</div>
<div id="question"><b>You're a well-recognized member of the neo-community on and off-site, how do you think that came about?</b><p>I guess I've just been around long enough. There aren't a vast number of people who have stuck around the site for so long without either becoming less active or going on hiatus now and again</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>What venues do you use to participate in the community?</b><p>I tend to be active wherever there's a Neopets presence really, weather thats boards, social media, or fansites.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>Have you ever gone on a hiatus?</b><p>No - I technically had about 2-3 months once where I didn't have internet access so I missed most of the Tale of Woe plot but that wasn't exactly by choice.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Given all that experience - if you had to reply in one sentence: do you think the site is generally going in a good direction right now?</b><p>No. It's been a downward trajectory since Viacom lost interest in my opinion, but things have accelerated. I feel like the staff we have genuinely care about the site - but I feel like that's always been the case. I think stuff like what Mac is doing with the creative contests and the news is good, but fundamentally the site is now broken and not enough is being done to fix it. That can only end with hemorrhaging users, which will have the knockon effect of less investment.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>Willow recently confirmed on the boards that the team is likely significantly smaller than most users expect, and that prioritization is therefore super important. What do you think TNT's top ~3 priorities should be to stop hemorrhaging users?</b><p>Converting all dailies, converting the most used features, and converting at least 12 additional games/getting the games system actually working correctly.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>When you say most used features, do you just mean that TNT should check traffic of different pages/features and pick the top few? And when you say convert, do you mean bring them into the new UI, or are you exclusively referring to Flash to HTML5 conversion?

</b><p>To me that means things that are core to the experience of the site - so things like the trading post, auctions, NC mall, battledome, etc. I am meaning bring to the new UI. Ideally we should be aiming for a point where the average user doesn't encounter the old version of the site unless they go looking.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>Roughly speaking, there are maybe 3 broad areas of complaints: (1) the lack of conversion of old features, (2) the lack of new features, (3) systemic issues in the current meta (e.g. issues with in-game economies, whether they be NP, NC,  or pet trading related). You seem very focused on (1).<br><br>Is there a reason you think that converting old features should be prioritized over (2) and (3)?</b><p>New features to me means new plots when people are asking for it. I don't really believe we can have a decent plot until the Battledome has HP increase back into it due to it being the most feasible method of getting a proper point distribution for valuable prizes. Equally, the GMC and Daily Dare are dead events until we get enough games back. Charity Corner works but is ultimately lesser while much of the trading system of Neopets is on the old format. New content needs to be built on foundations of the site that work, and we're not in that place yet.<br><br>Personally I feel (3) is the result of Neopets being designed as a game for much more people, and the lack of players is what is causing all these problems. You aren't going to get new players or old players back while half of the site looks broken the moment you log in.
</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>You mentioned earlier that there's a cycle of players leaving causing funding declining. The most monetized aspects of the site are notably left off your lists for both immediate priorities and new features. We found out a year ago that the UC black market had sellers with thousands of pets in their inventory, and this is a market TNT is exploring internalizing. NC items/micro-transactions are also an easy source of revenue.<br><br>Do you participate in NC or pet trading? Where do you rank NC UC pet release as a feature?</b><p>I would include the NC Mall as one of the key features to be converted. I trade NC when I want something new due to having a a store of trading fodder from back when I was buying everything, but I wouldn't call myself an active trader. I've never been interested in the pet trading scene, it isn't how I like to play Neopets.<br><br>I'm not a fan of the plans Gutterfoot revealed for how they wanted to release UCs. It should just be a one and done item that UCs the current pet/colour combo if it has a UC version available. I would assume it would be released as part of an NC Mall overhaul in that case.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>Given that the PC + NC are easily the most visibly active areas of the site, do you think there's potential here to retain + grow the player base?</b><p>I think leaning heavily into the NC Mall as a means of growing the player base would backfire personally. I don't really know enough about what PCers typically want TNT to do to know if leaning into pet trading would be beneficial.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>The site had a dwindling player base prior to the rollout of the beta UI/flash deprecation. Say TNT was able to solve those issues: what's the first feature you think they should prioritize then?</b><p>I feel at that point a large scale plot would be appropriate as a sort of 'welcome back to normal operations' celebration</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>You mentioned that you'd like a plot that involved a functioning BD. What kinda lore do you wish TNT would explore in a plot?</b><p>Personally I still have misgivings about the content team's ability to handle the writing of a plot well. I know there is a lot of pressure for a Lutari Island plot from users but that is literally the hardest plot you could attempt on Neopets. They need to walk before they run. A third Meridell plot essentially writes itself and should be relatively difficult to mess up.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>So re: Lutari Island, your concern is that they essentially wouldn't do the story justice?</b><p>I think Viacom at the height of its quality would have struggled. Lutari Island is essentially Mystery Island lite - I don't think there's a compelling narrative you can make that wouldn't feel lifted from a Mystery Island plot or that makes sense within the Neopets universe. Lutari Island's release, if it happens, is better suited to a short mini-event.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>The AC is currently going on. There's a contingent of users who are vocally dissatisfied at the moment (complaints include: buggy games, OP goalies, ranking system too difficult). There are also lots of users getting very into it regardless. What, if anything, would you change about the AC?</b><p>Oh loads of things. The games need some serious care, I was very disappointed when they announced they weren't working on games any more since that essentially meant we'd be getting unaltered versions from last year. Beyond that. AC5's achievement system needs to return, results should have decimals, and we should have some sort of food club-esque betting on daily match results.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>When I reached out initially, you said that despite what the metaverse team claims, the Neopets metaverse is a direct threat to the existence of the existing site. Can you expand on that a bit?</b><p>To me the evidence we've seen since October only suggests that Neopets.com is being winded down (either for full closure or just a skeleton crew). High profile departures, the clear pecking order where Metaverse are able to act unilaterally, even things like the portrait sale. The influencer videos they had clearly showed the HQ being boxed up behind them, despite us being told the HQ wasn't in any kind of danger.<br><br>School of Dragons staff have also been largely laid off now. Jumpstart is clearly being downsized heavily.
</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>The metaverse team has stated previously that 100% of their current funding comes from the NFT sales. This is money that never would have been available to the main site. Can you explain how the metaverse being (apparently) financially self-sufficient and Neopets winding down are related?</b><p>Personally I do not believe that. Netdragon got only a portion of the final sales, and even if you believe it was cashed into USD immediately to avoid the market dip, that money cannot stretch forever.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>So is the concern primarily that at some point, funding that would have gone toward the main site will be funneled into the metaverse?</b><p>I believe even indirectly that is already happening.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>Given all you've said about neo winding down for non-metaverse related reasons (i.e. this has been happening for years, flash/beta conversion, etc.) do you think investment in neo would have grown if not for the metaverse? If Netdragon is slashing funding for School of Dragons, too, could they just be making decisions about products based on revenue?</b><p>While I think Netdragon is acting out of financials, ultimately the reason the conversion stalled for so long is due to mismanagement at Jumpstart. They had 3-4 years where they knew what was coming and work just kept stalling. Ultimately the person responsible for that mismanagement is not only still in their position but actively involved in Metaverse development so Netdragon clearly are looking at results and not causes.<br><br>I don't think Metaverse will be the salve they hope it will be either because blockchain gaming is simply not the next big thing. I think they have bet on the wrong horse.
</p></div>


<div id="question"><b>What's your role at JN / what does your work there look like?</b><p>At Jellyneo my official role is to manage the Book of Ages, the section we have for lore and the history of Neopets. I do some other bits on the side like news posting and some wardrobe stuff though.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>Why do you think you've stuck around for 2+ decades with so few breaks?</b><p>At this stage I feel like it is mostly habit but I do feel like Neopets has a unique community that I enjoy and the Neopets brand and world are something that a lot of other projects have tried and failed to capture.</p></div>

<div class="title_caption">Reseller, guild founder, and main market maller / June 6th, 2022</div>
<div id="question"><b>What do you enjoy doing on neo, or spend the most time on?</b>
<p>I keep coming back to Neopets for the reselling aspect of the game. Making Neopoints and growing my account. 
I spend majority of my time on Neopets lurking the auction house, trading post and trading board in hope finding a deal to resell.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>You're also the leader of the most active TC guild right now, right?</b>
<p>Merchant Plus started out as a main market mall in September 3rd 2020. Shortly after the guild Merchant Plus was created where it was private for a year with close friends. We made the decision to make the guild public earlier this year for anyone with the same interest in making NPs to join.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>You mentioned you really like reselling on neopets. Resellers have always had a bit of a bad reputation outside the TC. However, Merchant Plus' reputation seems to go beyond that. There have been multiple boards on site events, the newbie chat, and the BD chat, made by users frustrated with your guild. Why do you think the dislike is so strong?
</b>
<p>Haters don't hate you, they hate themselves. Because you're a reflection of what they wish to be.
The reason why Merchant Plus is so relevant is because a lot of the richest Neopians are with Merchant Plus. 
With great success you also get envious people that goes along with it who will make up accusations to make themselves feel better.</p>
<p>Despite all the accusations, Merchant Plus is created and constructed by a group of close friends of 15 years. 
We love sharing old stories about the trading community and helping new traders with their journey by passing on knowledge.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>To be clear, you think people dislike your guild because they wish they were you? Couldn't they just join the guild if that were the case?
</b>
<p>Joining Merchant Plus guild is one thing, creating wealth is another. Becoming a member of our guild gives you the opportunity to learn from others. To create wealth, you'll have to put in the hard work.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>What kinds of wealth-creation techniques can members learn from experienced users?</b>
<p>Observation is the key to success. If you want to understand the market, you have to understand what items sells for and what items are in demand. 
Our guild always share things that sell through the auction house. We also share our profits that we make so others have an indication what these items can be bought for, and sold onto a profit with patience and the right timing.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>One thing a lot of users specifically call out about your guild is that users inflate items (e.g. r101 stamps) by buying up the stock and listing them at a higher price. Is this a wealth creation technique that you use?</b>
<p>Inflation is something talked about on a daily basis. It could be anything from R101 stamps as you mentioned, or perhaps an r99 item for argument sake. 
The miscommunication and accusation from the community, they believe that Merchant Plus guild helps each other by putting NPS to the table to buy up a certain item. 
If anyone that has a true understanding of the Neopets economy would know that's a terrible idea.</p>

<ul><li> It's against the rules to group inflate on a certain item.</li>
<li> Even if it was within the rules to do so, having more than one person controlling an item limits the control or say you have to sell that item.</li>
<li>People don't realize that you actually don't need that much nps upfront to make a certain item inflate.</li>
</ul></div>

<div id="question"><b>Got it -- so you're basically confirming that there is no group pooling of money or group efforts to inflate an item, which would be against the rules. Do you mind me asking if you ever use this technique on your own?
</b>
<p>There are 2 ways of inflation:

</p><ul><li>Buy something out in the market and try to sell it as soon as possible to recover your investment.</li>
<li>Buy something out in the market, and sit on it before selling. This could be months/or years to come.</li>
</ul><p>Option A is where the community gets upset. When a price fluctuates significantly within a week. Not enough time for people to accept the price increase. I'm a huge fan of option B. Buying an investment in bulk, and coming back to it after a reasonable length of duration and see how the market has accepted this valuation.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>How do you think the inflation of specific items impacts the neo community?</b>
<p>If we take a look at the Neopets history in terms of item valuation, you will find that 10 years ago the prices were much higher then vs now. We are also playing in an era where Neopoints are so much easier to generate now vs 10 years ago.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>Prices were higher in big part because supply was much lower than today for several significant reasons: (1) shops now clear, so r90+ items stock much more frequently, (2) multiple CCs (intentional and unintentional) have occurred, releasing hundreds of thousands of new r90+ items into the economy several times, and (3) there weren't tens of thousands of duped items floating around.<br><br>

Today, despite all these new sources of supply, item values are continuing to creep up. Given this, my question is: do you still think it's valid to use 10 years ago as a reference point?</b><br><br>

Absolutely, they're factors and events that has changed the market over the years but all those are temporary measures<sup class="note">[IN]<span style="position: absolute;"><b>Interviewers note:</b> shops clearing and duped items (new + significant stores of them) have not stopped.</span></sup>. 
The biggest change is going back to the NC market. 
NC was introduced in 2007 but didn't really take off several years later when the trading community changed platforms impacting the Neopoints market entirely.<br><br>
In the older days when there was no NC, everyone was involved making Neopoints in some way or another to build their wealth to spend on paint brushes, collectibles etc. 
The trading/auction community was booming in this era.<br><br>
If you look now, the trading chat community on the boards is a ghost town vs the NC boards. The market has changed. Hence going back,  people don't have to work hard to make Neopoints and instead, those who are fortunate enough to open up their wallets can buy an NC item without putting any work required in the game.<br><br>
With that impact, the market slowly started deteriorating. 
In the last 10 years, the neo community has been immune to the crashed market prices and now we are seeing prices creeping back up and people are frustrated over this; unless they own that specific item that has increased. <br><br>
Observing the market within the last two years has been interesting. We've seen a steady incline of price inflation. I also believe it's no coincidence that a lot of older players have returned to Neo within the last two years due to Covid Lockdown and are playing the game on what it used to be before NC.

<div id="question"><b>How do you think this impacts casual users, who may not be interested at all in reselling or wealth creation?</b>
<p>Neopets isn't about being the richest or wealthiest in the game, for some it's a target and a goal to do better. 
You don't need to resell or invest to make Neopoints.</p>

<p>Food Club and the Battledome Daily/Jetsam Ace can give you 1m-2m a week alone.</p>

<p>Inflation isn't the main core of the issue that impacts the community, it's the players who become lazy over the years to go out there and make some nps.</p>

<p>NC has taken over the years where people don't have to work hard to make nps and instead those who are fortunate enough to open up their wallets can buy a NC item without any work required in the game. It's that mentality of laziness that has occurred.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>Some items inflate by tens of millions of NPs. E.g. some r99 collectables are up 100%+ within the span of ~6 months. I just want to confirm: you think the objection to this by casual players is due to laziness?</b>
<p>Those who doesn't accept the new current market value with true sales to support; are the ones I'm classifying as being lazy. If there's a recent rapid price change, of course, I'd wait it out to see what the market stabilizes it. The r99 stamps inflation are driven by other reasons like re-releasing certain R101 stamps, making the album valuation drop, and making the r99 stamps desirable with demand going up.

<div id="question"><b>What aspects of neo do you think are going well?</b>
<p>Things going well for Neo right now is the open communication from TNT to the community. It's a shame that action getting the site fixed in a fashionably manner lacks from the team.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>Do you see yourself playing neo in 5 years?</b>
<p>My account turned 15 years old yesterday so yes I can see myself playing in 5 years from now. I really hope Neopets is still going by the time I retire because I will need a hobby when that time comes!</p></div>

<h2><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/foo_king_skarl_candy.gif" style="margin-bottom: -20px; width: 70px;"> neo truths</h2>
<div class="title_caption">Neo Truths is the pseudonym of a user who's revealed several exploits: mass UC generation, Skarl Collectable Charm not being awarded, r100s failing to stock, and others.<br><br><b>Some edits were made to this interview.</b> The interview was casual, so I adjusted some responses to be complete sentences for ease of reading. I left the actual content unaltered, except when there were filter issues that required synonyms.<br><br>June 8th, 2022</div>
<div id="question"><b>What areas do you think you might have more insights on than the average person?</b><p>I have the advantage of being able to browse neo code + the advantage of spending my free time on checking issues I am interested in, unlike neo devs that need to focus on whatever is assigned to them.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>What are your thoughts on the current state of Neopets security? What's going well? What isn't going well?</b><p>Neo security has always been bad and a lot of exploits come from code even before [JumpStart] acquisition. I don't think they have anyone in charge of improving/monitoring it, so unless someone does something very drastic, it isn't even noticed.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>What solutions would you propose?</b><p>It's hard to suggest solutions without context like budget and how its being spent. We all want more devs and staff to make things faster but that might not be possible in order to stay profitable.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>How long have you had access to Neo's source code, and how long did you have it before you started using it to expose broken/abused functionality?</b><p>I don't remember the exact date. 1-4 months before [social media] guy.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>I'm not familiar with that person, but I'm guessing someone shared publicly that they had access to Neo's source code?</b><p>Yes, it wasn't a Neopets player. It made quite the scandal at the time.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>In case I can't find that, do you have a ballpark idea of whether this was more or less than, say, 3 years ago?</b><p>[They shared a link to a December 2020 social media post where someone publicly posted redacted portions of Neopets' source code, explaining that there was a severe leak that needed to be patched.]</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Are you comfortable sharing how you got access to this code?</b><p>[Now patched method that leverages Git and subversion.]</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Did you ever do anything with the code for financial gain, and were you ever involved with illegit businesses?</b><p>I asked TNT if they had bug bounty rewards but they said no. Asked [site] if they would share profits or I would reveal their [UC] gen and they said no. I know a seller, but they wouldn't trust me without giving my real user, and I don't want to do that.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Has anyone ever questioned your motives for sharing the info you do?</b><p>I get many thanks but not usually a why.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>How long do these audits (r100s, Mystery Pic, Skarl Charm) take you, and how did you initially get motivated to start doing them?</b><p>r100s investigation took like 3 hours, Skarl 2 hours, Mystery Pic 8 hours. r100s and Skarl Charm I checked for my own interest. Making sure of info + making the post is what took most of time. For Mystery Pic, I was also curious about it. Some of those [deep-dives] might have been requested by someone, not sure.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>So any dev on TNT could have figured out some of the issues plaguing the site for years with a few hours?</b><p>Yeah... but that just means no one [i.e. management] asked them to.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>I'm really curious how you decided to go this route rather than monetizing, like many people do.</b><p>Monetizing seems like too much trouble, dealing with people and payments.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Have you had to deal with any flack from users who leverage these exploits for revealing this stuff?</b><p>No, never got contacted by them.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>In the link you shared earlier, the guy who said Neo had a leak eventually said that the issue was patched. So is your mechanism a separate, still functioning way to query Neopets's production data?</b><p>That issue was patched, but [if you] already having the code, [it just takes] browsing for a long time searching for vulnerabilities. Took me months to find one though.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Do you have a list of ideas on what to investigate? What can we expect next?</b><p>Not really, either something new happens or I get asked to do it. I get some queries by chat/DMs, but it's not worth making a post for them.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>Do you actively play neo on a main? What do you enjoy doing on the site?</b><p>I've played with several accounts over the years yes. I just enjoy reading boards and seeing how illegitimate players interact on neo.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>So how do some of the biggest illegitimate users interact on neo? Do you recall any funny interactions?</b><p>Well there are the simple and obvious rule-breaking from new names and the complex and hidden rule-breaking from known names, where you can never be certain if they are just that lucky or it's an elaborate ruse. Like someone got lent hundreds of millions in BD weapons for a BD tournament, months later user that got them lent starts selling them.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>What steps can users take to protect their accounts from other users with access to these exploits?</b><p>Against someone with code access + db read access, you have no protection. Most hacking these days is using old leak and making tickets to get tnt to give them access to accounts not theirs though.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>You mentioned db read access - do you have an idea of how many people might have the level of access you do? And do you know if db write access is something people have, e.g. can people still conjure items out of nowhere?</b><p>Whenever I find someone with an item gen, I try to find it and make TNT patch it. You can never be certain if there is none at the moment though. People could always know a way and not use it until necessary.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>You mentioned you asked TNT about bug bounties: as far as you know, have they made any attempt to patch your access? Do you think they're even aware of the specific exploit you're using?</b><p>The less I use my access the less opportunities to find it. Not sure they are looking for it though. It can be a lot of hours spent with no results so they may be reluctant I guess. Once I spent like 2 weeks to find how someone else had DB access.</p></div>
<div id="question"><b>If you could get one (1) feature prioritized, what would it be?</b><p>r100 items restocking. The last r100 that restocked was in 2005.</p></div>

<div id="question"><b>What would you say to people who are scared/worried about these exploits, and wish you would just point them out to TNT instead of catching bugs in the game?</b><p>Neo is full of breaches and multiple people had (and maybe still have) access for years. The only difference is they use it privately (mostly for genning and selling offsite) and I try to address some known issues with actual data. I have already reported 2 exploits that allowed db access that other people had used (one of them for months/years hard to tell). I could have not found them if I didn't have access myself. I could always choose to reveal my own method thus losing access which would be the correct thing, but at the same time that would let the others run free. But yes I understand that from a user perspective its very worrying someone can arbitrarily access their data.
