<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>
...to Cleophelia's petpage. What exactly is this, you ask? Good question. I'm still figuring that out myself. I'm not the kind of person who develops elaborate characters for my pets, or makes accompanying petpages (to each their own, of course, but personally, if I'm going to spend lots of time on writing and artwork I'd prefer it to be original, non-neo stuff.)To be perfectly honest, I saw this lovely layout at That K*lls Me and thought it would be a shame <i>not</i> to have it on Cleo's page. And of course, I'd like my pets to have as many non-default petpages as possible. I may not do characters/pages for my pets, but I still spoil them :3 Cleo is particularly dear since I created and painted her myself, and of course I'm totally in love with the whole Maraquan Eyrie aesthetic. Mmmm, complementary colors.
</p>
<p>So. What to do with this page? I'm thinking it'll be a sort of blog, a place to rant about the latest developments in my neo-life. Stay tuned for some profound insights, people.</p>

<h1>On the whole UC thing</h1>

<p>So. My take on the whole UC trading business. I honestly don't have a very strong or definite position here. Like with a lot of Neopets things that I wasn't around for the inception of, when it comes to trading I sort of feel like an outsider looking in, even as I'm trying to break into the UC tier myself. So let me just try to sum up what the whole mess looks like to me.</p>

<h2>The Story of Zero</h2>

<p>Some context: I played Neopets for a few years as a kid---you know, back when the PC was actually used for its intended purpose of  "learning about Neopets that other users are going to abandon and finding out stories about other Neopians who have adopted Neopets." The legal status of trading aside, it honestly never occurred to me that pets could be a thing that could be traded. Of course, even if trading had been a thing back then, I wouldn't have had anything to offer. Young Zero did not have the ability to make NP or choose names that weren't absolutely hideous.</p>

<p>Skip to the 2010's, when, as a bored college student, I fell off the proverbial wagon and found myself sucked back into the black hole of Neopets. A lot had changed during my extended hiatus--NC, Habitariums, the battledome, various new lands/plots, etc. As a kid, my neopets experience had been limited to playing endless flash games and wishing I had the cash to paint my pets something better than Disco. As an adult, I found my horizons broadening exponentially. I began dipping toes into previously unexplored areas of the site, and it was during one of these forays that I stumbled upon a Neopian Times article about PC lingo.</p> 

<p>This, of course, led me down the rabbit hole of trading. While the idea of trading pets initially weirded me out, I soon began to see the possibilities.</p>

<p>Like most players who were around at the time, I was 5000% salty about the conversion. It coincided with the start of middle school for me, and was a large part of why I lost interest in Neopets. When I eventually returned from my long hiatus, I was perfectly aware that UCs existed--it just hadn't occurred to me that it might be possible to obtain one for myself.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the ~trading epiphany~ part of my Neo-renaissance occurred post-Forgotten Shore/Anchor Management, after the mass deflation of Pirate Draik Eggs and MPs. By the time I started lurking the PC and trying to grasp the whole trading concept, the gap between converted and unconverted pet values was bigger than ever (this was RECENTLY, folks. I'm not kidding when I say I'm new to trading.)</p>

<p>So what did this mean for me? Once I realized it was possible, I absolutely <i>had</i> to own a UC Faerie Blumaroo. It seemed to me that the main way people broke into the UC tier (aside from time and persistence, which for me were relegated to Plan B) was through sheer dumb luck, so I stalked the PC and pound surfed obsessively. Eventually, I was able to charm my way into a VWN Draik and onto a few finalist lists for UFA UCs.</p>

<p>And, well…that's where I am today. Still out there, trawling for nice names, hoping for lucky zaps, applying my head off in the hopes of one day obtaining that elusive bunch of pixels. And of course, I'm very much not alone. It seems like just about everyone has at least one UC dream--even those lucky or persistent enough to already own UCs always seem to be trying to trade their way back up to another UC goal.</p>

<h2>The UC Controversy</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, our friendly neighborhood misanthropes are having a field day with this stuff. The two camps seem to be "UCs are overrated and stupid" and "People who think UCs are overrated are just salty that they don't own any.''  </p>

<p>My take? They're both right. UCs are a terrible idea. Seriously, who decided back during the conversion that it would be fun to grandfather some species/color combinations, but not others? Like, what did they think was going to happen there?</p>

<p>I'm not saying they should have forcibly converted every single pet on the site. I'm not even saying they should have left every single pet the option to remain unconverted. Just that it was kind of insane to create the UC option and expect the users of this site not to make it into a huge, ridiculous Thing. Yep, I decided it merits a capital T. It's that much of a Thing.</p>

<p>So what about the other side, those who say that anyone complaining about the existence or popularity of UCs is just bitter and jealous? I think they're right about 80% of the time. I'm sure there are some people who truly aren't interested in owning a UC, but I bet they'd still jump at the chance if you offered them one (if only so they could trade it for virutally any converted pet.) As long as the "UCs are dumb" group remains in the minority, UCs will be valuable--no amount of griping is going to change that.</p>

<h2>The State of the PC</h2>

<p>The real problem, as I think most PCers would agree, is the way trading has become stagnant. There are a lot of reasons for this--the deflation of the Draik, the mass exodus of long-time users as a result of JS's glitches and blunders--but the one everyone seems to enjoy blaming for everything is ~Za.</p>

<p>Oh, ~Za. In my experience, PCers love to hate on ~Za almost as much as they love to hate on the PC. Personally, I'm neutral. The folks behind ~Za never claimed to be anything more than a guideline, and the tiers are based on actual trades, so you can't really accuse them of creating the current stagnant environment. We lazy PCers are the ones who gradually assimilated the tiers into our collective consciousness and decided they were law. Nowadays, that's just how things are--rigid tiers and a huge gap between UC and converted pet values. Pretty bleak.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>By the time I arrived on the scene, this was just how trading was. I don't remember the good ol' days when a UC mutant could trade for a UC PRDK and both parties came away happy. Those oft-longed-for good old days have taken on almost a mythical quality--when people talk about how they traded a BN Draik for their UC Faerie Lenny, I struggle to believe them. It feels kind of like hearing a grandparent talk about how in their day, everyone walked 15 miles to school and ordered their houses out of a catalog for 25 cents.</p>

<p>So that's my bleak assessment of the state of UC trading. It's funny--I'm pessimistic about the state of trading as a whole, yet fairly optimistic about my own chances. Maybe it's because I've had good luck with trades so far, or because I'm confident in my applying-for-UCs abilities. Regardless, when I do finally break into the UC tier, you'll hear about it--so watch this space. ;)</p>

<h1>On pet characters</h1>

<h2>Why don't you make pet characters, Zero?</h2>

<p><b>The short answer</b>:</p>

<p>I don't feel like it. ¯|_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p><b>The long answer</b>:</p>

<p>First, let me start of by saying that this is in no way an indictment against people who <i>do</i> make characters—y'all are creative and great and seem to be the vast majority of active, adult players. </p>

<p>But it's just not for me, and here's why:</p>

<p>1) <b>I can't art</b>. Like at all.</p>

<p>2) I <i>can</i> write. Pretty darn well. But here's the thing: <b>I come to Neopets to relax, blow off steam, and have fun</b>. Not so much to be creative. Which isn't to say that being creative isn't fun. I am a very creative person—offline. I spend a great deal of of my time watching/reading/writing/editing/thinking about stories. My job, when you strip it down to the basics, is storytelling. I love my job, and I love the creative aspect of it, but it's also <i>exhausting</i>. So when I come home and click over to Neopets, I wanna turn my brain <i>off</i>. I am here to play dress-up, support my favorite imaginary cyberspace soccer team, and earn fake money so that my pixel-wads can look more impressive than everyone else's pixel-wads. I genuinely enjoy trading (both pets and NC) as well, or I wouldn't be doing it.</p>

<p>There's a point here, I promise: I can't speak for everyone, but <b>creating pet characters would stress me out</b>. I can't tell you how many times I've heard people agonizing about their characters/universe or even abandoning/adopting out pets because they can't come up with a character for them (which seems utterly crazy to me and makes me reflexively clutch my fantastic, character-less pets tighter.) I know pet character creation would be extra stressful for me specifically because of my personality and writing style. When I write fiction, I agonize about choosing each word with meticulous care, brutally critique my own writing, edit it 1,500 times, and am still terrified to let anyone else see it. I once had a nervous breakdown in a screenwriting class because I realized my margins were the wrong size. Not exactly conducive to the fun, chill Neopets experience I'm aiming for.</p>

<p>So no pet characters for me. <b>I like my pets the way they are</b>. Take Sybella, for example. Would I like her better if I wrote a story about how she was an exiled Atlantean princess trying to make it in New York City? Nope. She's already a green narwhal wearing a ton of jewelry—that's plenty interesting enough for me. Her story is the story of how I found the perfect untaken, obscure RW, created a green flotsam, and painstakingly saved up for a Royal Paint Brush. The story of the lucky day I bumped into someone willing to give me their Desert Flotsam clothes so Syb could become a crosspaint, and of the day I was struck by a rare bolt of artistic inspiration and ended up winning her a gold BC trophy. </p>

<p>My pets already have unique stories. I'm content to let them dwell in the fun, fictitious universe they already inhabit: Neopia. There are already so many cool things to do with one's pets on this site that character stuff just feels like overki!l to me.</p><p>

</p><h2>The rare exception</h2>

<p><b>But Zero, there's a pet character/story on your UC Sponge Aisha project page!</b> So there is, you clever nameless internet presence. So there is. But that particular story arose organically. I was telling my little brothers a bedtime story, and I was already halfway through it and 100% in love with the concept by the time I realized "hey, with a few tweaks this could become a story about a Neopet I want to trade for." A pet I want to trade for and a story I enjoyed writing happened to coincide. Nothing stressful about that! </p>

<h2>So what's the problem here?</h2>

<p>The problem is that <b>pet characters seem to have become the standard by which many people seem to judge other players</b>. It really, really bothers me that having pet characters seems to be many people's idea of what separates a "good" owner from a bad or mediocre one. I feel excluded from potential guilds who have pet characters in their requirements (unless they're specifically a RP or character-based guild, of course.) Worst of all, it feels all but impossible to make applications for UFA pets when I don't create characters—I'm paranoid that fosters will take one look at me, see that I don't do characters, and toss my app straight into the reject pile. I feel as though I have to work twice as hard and look twice as good as applicants who <i>do</i> make characters just to have a chance.</p>

<p>I'm willing to rise to the challenge, of course—and have, if my track record is anything to go by. I don't mean to complain or be a downer. Still, no one likes to feel as though the deck is stacked against them. I'm allowed to complain a <i>little</i>, aren't I? I don't want to jeopardize my chances of being chosen to adopt a pet I'm applying for, but I also want my app to be genuine and reflect who I am as a player/pet owner. Like I said, I come to this website to have fun—and there's nothing fun about selling out.</p>
