</p>

<p>
I've heard so many people tell me how hard this game is and that they are shocked how I have the avatar.<br>
So I thought I'd share my wisdom, as I find it relatively easy.
</p>

<h2>*Rewards*</h2>

<p>
Let's start off with what you can get from this game:
</p>

<p>
<b>The avatar:</b><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/extremepotato.gif"></p>

<p>
<b>The trophies:</b><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/226_1.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/226_2.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/226_3.gif"></p>

<p>
This guide is mainly here to help you to get the avatar, as I have never gained much of a hi-score, and have only earned myself a bronze trophy.<br>
I don't understand how some people manage 500 or so xD<br><b>The score needed in this game to achieve the avatar is 200 points.</b><br>
This isn't specifically here to help you to get to the top of the leader board, but you never know.<br>
If you're good at the game and this strategy works for you, there's no reason why you shouldn't really =)
</p>

<h2>*The Game*</h2>

<p>
Ok, so the aim of the game is extremely simple, and I'm sure you already know it:<br><b>To count potatoes.</b><br>
Sounds thrilling, right?<br>
Ohh, indeed it is!<br>
It <i>is</i> called <b>Extreme</b> Potato Counter, if I remember rightly!<br>
Ok, so it's not that exciting, but the game can earn you a shiny avatar.<br>
Or at the least, it can relatively easily get you <b>3,000 NP per day</b> (dependent on the monthly score-NP ratio).
</p>

<p>
Potatoes will fly across the screen from ALL directions.<br>
Despite what you may have read elsewhere, they DO also fly from the top of the screen, so be aware of this!<br>
At the end of each round, you are presented with a box in which you type in how many potatoes you think you saw.<br>
Be quick though, it is timed! You get about <b>15 seconds</b> to type in an answer.<br>
However, if you get the answer wrong, even by one, it's game over! =(
</p>
<h2>*My strategy*</h2>

<h3>*Quality &amp; Size*</h3>

<p>
Firstly, I advise you to play the game in <b>low</b> or <b>medium</b> quality if your computer (like mine) is prone to lagging.<br>
This is because, if the potatoes start to move slower, it makes it more difficult for me.<br>
Some may find it easier to count them moving slower, but in my personal opinion it gets you very confused, as they go very jittery!<br>
I often find myself counting potatoes twice, forgetting that I've already counted them if this happens.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to size, I've always played it in the <b>regular</b> size.<br>
However, if your computer still lags a lot, again I would suggest the <b>smallest</b> size.<br>
It could also be easier to count the potatoes this way, as you have less of an area to watch...<br>
However, it is argued that by having it on the <b>largest</b> size, you have more time to count them before they exit the screen.<br>
However, I've never really found it much easier or harder on any window size.<br>
It's up to you really =) I suggest trying each way to see what works best for you.
</p>

<h3>*Sound &amp; Music*</h3>

<p>
Gahh, the sound in this game really annoys me!<br>
I always turn it off because I find it easier to concentrate.<br>
With most games, I find it easier to have my own music playing. However, I would NOT suggest that with this game!<br>
It splits your focus (especially if you start singing along! *points to self*), and you can also get into the habit of only counting potatoes to the beat of the music xD *again points to self*<br>
But again, I'd try it either way to see what works best for you, if you're unsure.
</p>

<h3>*My Play Style*</h3>

<p>
Every. Potato. Counts.<br>
I lost at 199 points before I got the avatar. Yeh, I know xD<br>
So what I do is make sure that I get <b>at least 10 potatoes</b> on the first level.<br>
If I don't, I deliberately guess wrong and start again.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to actually counting the potatoes, the first few levels are pretty easy.<br>
However, once you get to later levels, they start moving very fast, and more <b>random vegetables are added in</b> =O<br>
It's relatively easy to avoid counting them, but they <i>do</i> get in the way a lot and can hide potatoes, so be aware of this.<br>
This is the order in which these other vegetables are introduced to the game:
</p>

<p>
<b>Level 3: Carrots</b><br><img src="http://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52369532973_1d60e9c7c7_n.jpg"><br><b>Level 5: Sweetcorn</b><br><img src="http://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52369718830_b5e3d6929e_m.jpg"><br><b>Level 7: Aubergines</b><br><img src="http://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52369612329_d10f571820_t.jpg"></p>

<p>
There are others that are brought in at later levels, however, at this point there are so many items flying across the screen that a screenshot of these proved quite difficult!
</p>

<p>
The level numbers indicated are the <b>earliest</b> in which I have found these other vegetables to first appear in the game.<br>
However, they will NOT always be first seen in the level I have put above, this is just an indication.<br>
Although they may arrive only in later levels, there should not be any vegetable other than potatoes before level 3!
</p>

<p>
Once I get to the later levels, I stare straight into the middle of the game window, and use my <b>peripheral vision</b> to count the potatoes as they enter from the sides.<br>
This means that you aren't focusing on any specific potatoes, and therefore are <b>less likely</b> to miss others.<br>
However, it's tricky in the later levels to tell if more than one comes through on top of each other by counting them this way.<br>
Luckily, they usually separate further across the screen and this isn't too hard to spot...<br>
But nevertheless, keep on the look out for it!
</p>

<p>
Finally, on the really 'extreme' (see what I did there?! xD) levels, if you really don't think you've counted right, go with your first instinct or add a few on!<br>
I would suggest to never subtract any from your guess unless you're pretty sure that you have over-counted.<br>
This is because it is much more likely at these stages that you have missed some than over-counted.<br>
And if all else fails.. Take an educated guess!<br>
The number of potatoes <i>usually</i> increases slightly from one level to the next, so just have a go if you're <i>really</i> unsure or gave up counting!
</p>

<p>
Ok, well that's all I have to say really, except for <b>GOOD LUCK!!</b><br>
And, as always, practise makes perfect ;)<br>
...Bet you knew that was coming =P
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I hope this guide was helpful!<br>
