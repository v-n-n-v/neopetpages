<h1>Further Reading On Annual Events</h1>
</div><div align="left">

<p></p>
● I recommend <i>Jellyneo</i>s Neopian Year article. It has more detail then the <a href="//www.neopets.com/calendar.phtml">official one.</a> Jellyneo's news posts are the best source for new events as they are released.
<p></p>
● <a href="http://neopets.com/~Rebme"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/T5rEqhn.gif" border="0"></a>
<br><a href="http://neopets.com/~Rebme">The Expanded Calendar</a> is a very detailed petpage listing many annual events that the <i>Jellyneo</i> article does not. It also has a detailed guide on aged account features at the bottom.
<p></p>
● A few of my research sources: <i>Jellyneo</i>, <i>Jellyneo's Item Database</i>, <i>Jellyneo's Battlepedia</i>, <a href="http://neopets.com/~Rebme">The Expanded Calendar</a>

</div><div align="left">
<h1>Your Pet's Birthdays</h1>
<br>● SunnyNeo has a birthday calculator that will convert their age in hours (found on their pet lookup) into the exact month and day.
<br>● Visit your pet's lookup on their birthday to get a free cupcake. You can choose between:
<table class="imagegrid"><tr><td><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bak_neobirthday_petccakeb.gif"><br><i>Starry Blue<br>Birthday<br>Cupcake</i><br>+5 Defence</td>
<td><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bak_neobirthday_petccakep.gif"><br><i>Starry Pink<br>Birthday<br>Cupcake</i><br>+5 HP</td>
<td><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bak_neobirthday_petccakey.gif"><br><i>Starry Yellow<br>Birthday<br>Cupcake</i><br>+5 Strength</td>
</tr></table>
● Each pet can only eat 1 cupcake a year, so I recommend feeding your pet the cupcake as soon as you get it. The cupcakes can't be gifted, sold, or traded.
<p></p><br>
● You can see if it's another pet's birthday on their pet lookup! The birthday theme (if the custom layout doesn't cover it) and floating balloons will show.
<p></p>● April 12th - <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=deeohgi">deeohgi</a> (not my pet) and <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=ShoyHoyMyNoy">ShoyHoyMyNoy</a>
<p></p>● April 14th - <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=THELID">THELID</a>
<p></p>● April 19th - <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=OTTERPOPStar">OTTERPOPStar</a>
<p></p>● April 25th - <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=Caligni">Caligni</a>
<p></p>● May 10th - <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=OldManJinkies">OldManJinkies</a>
<p></p>● July 17th - <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=supunu">supunu</a>
<p></p><br>
● <i>Good Day at the Bank avatar</i> - Make sure the pet whose birthday it currently is <a href="//www.neopets.com/quickref.phtml">is active</a> then deposit Neopoints in <a href="//www.neopets.com/bank.phtml">the bank</a>. Creating a pet will also work for getting this as long as you fulfill the other requirements all on the same day.

<h1>Free Training</h1>
<br>● The <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/academy.phtml">Swashbuckling Academy</a> offers free training to any pet that's species matches the current pet day. For example, all Aishas can receive training on January 3rd, which is Aisha Day.
<br>● <a href="//www.neopets.com/calendar.phtml">Find all pet days here.</a> If a pet is level 40+ or they're enrolled in another course, they cannot receive the free training.
<p></p>
<hr><p></p>

<h1>Daily Puzzle Prizes</h1>
<br>● The <a href="//www.neopets.com/community/index.phtml">Daily Puzzle</a> is likely to have themed prizes on various holidays. New Year's Eve, December 25th, Neopet's own birthday, and many pet holidays are all likely to have prizes.

<h1>Contests</h1>
<br>● Jellyneo has an article called "Creative Contest Prizes" that includes all of the contests.

<p></p><br>● <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/mysterypic.phtml">Mystery Picture Competition</a> - If you can guess what a small piece of the picture is you'll get <i>Neopoints</i> and possibly an <i>item prize</i>.

<p></p><br>● <a href="//www.neopets.com/art/gallery.phtml">Art Gallery</a> - This can be competitive because many submissions are sent in. To find the current month's schedule look for a post by <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_contest_judge">tnt_contest_judge</a> titled "[Month Name] Art Gallery Schedule" where you'll find upcoming themes, holidays, and random (themeless) art days.
<br>● <i>10,000 NP</i>, <i>a rare item</i>, and a <i>trophy</i> are given to everyone who gets their artwork published. You will be Neomailed if you win.
<br>● <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Maybl">Click here</a> for a well written Art Gallery guide.


<p></p><br>● <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/new_caption.phtml">Caption Contest</a> - Create a clever caption for a random image. Starts towards the beginning of each month and submissions are accepted until around the 21st of that month. I couldn't confirm the exact dates. Avoid last minute submissions because there's a risk it will not be seen. Winners are selected at the end of the month.
<br>● You can submit as many captions as you want.
<br>● Depending on how well you place you can win <i>NP</i>, a <i>trophy</i>, a <i>rare item</i>, and the <i>Caption Contest - Funny</i> avatar. You will <b>not</b> receive a Neomail if you win, so you will need to check the contest page.
<br>● The top 5 winners of every non-10th round win the <i>Caption Contest - Hilarious</i> avatar.
<br>● I highly recommend Jellyneo's "Caption Contest" titled guide.

<p></p><br>● <a href="//www.neopets.com/contributions_poems.phtml">Poetry Contest</a> - Any style of poetry is allowed.
<br>● Most <a href="//www.neopets.com/calendar.phtml">pet holidays</a> have contest days devoted to them.
<br>● Winners receive <i>1,000 NP</i>, a <i>trophy</i>, and a <i>rare item</i>. You will receive a Neomail if you win.
<br>● Here is the <a href="//www.neopets.com/help_search.phtml?string=poems">official FAQ.</a>
<br>● I highly recommend Jellyneo's guide titled "The Poetry Contest".

<p></p><br>● <a href="//www.neopets.com/art/storytell.phtml">Storytelling Contest</a> - A user starts writing a story, then it's up to other users to add continuations of that story.
<br>● The schedule and amount of contributors can vary. A contest can last 5 days to over two weeks.
<br>● At least winners are picked to contribute. Sometimes many people are picked.
<br>● Winners receive <i>2,000 NP</i>, a <i>rare item</i>, and a <i>trophy</i>. You will receive a Neomail if you win.
<br>● Here is the <a href="//www.neopets.com/art/storytell.phtml?issue=155">official FAQ.</a>
<br>● I highly recommend Jellyneo's guide titled "The Storytelling Contest".
