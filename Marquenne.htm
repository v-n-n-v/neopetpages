<h1>Resetting your Avatar Count</h1>
 
<p>
In September of 2008, Kay (earthlingdreamz) decided it was high time to give the avatar collectors
across Neopia a helping hand. Thus, she decided to make boards for the last few days of every month,
asking the other top avatar collectors to wait to reset their avatar count until the 2nd of the next
month. Lo and behold, since 2008 many people have gotten the shiny Avatar Collector avie!

<h1>Last Reset (May/June 2024) Stats</h1>

<p>Q. What was the lowest score for the Avatar Collector Avie?<br>
A. <b> 360 (ouch!)(previously: 354, 345, 347, 340, 343, 330, 335)</b><br></p>

<p><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/342_1.gif"><br></p><p>Q. What were the lowest scores for trophies?<br>
Please refer to <a href="//www.neopets.com/~TrophyTracker">Trophy Tracker</a> for historical tracking. I update this every so often, not necessarily every month. The previous scores are just to give you a range of possibilities.
<br>For the Dec/Jan 2023 reset, the scores were:

<br><b>BRONZE</b> 381 (previously 372, 377, 371, 377, 369, 361, 365, 355, 373, 371)
<br><br></p>

<p><img src="//images.neopets.com/trophies/342_2.gif"></p><p>Q. When did reset occur?<br>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
 
<p>
So you might have seen my boards, month after month, and wondered - what is she talking about?
Why is it important? And most importantly, why didn't she start doing this sooner? If you have further questions, please neomail <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=earthlingdreamz">Kay</a> and she will answer them asap!
</p>

<p>Q. I was on the HST but got skipped. What gives?<br>
A. There is an HST glitch. <b>DO NOT</b> play Brain Tree or Kiss The Mortog on the First if you are going for Avatar Collector (trophy or avatar). Long story short, a bug exists that will prevent your score from counting on the AC HST. Your score will appear, but you will be skipped over by the script when trophies and avs are awarded.</p>
 
<p>Q. How do you Reset avatars?<br>
A. Top Avatar
Collectors reset their avatar count by changing their shop keeper from Usul - Gothic to another, viewing the front of their shop, and then changing the shop keeper back to the Usul - Gothic and viewing their shop front again to re-gain Emo Usuki.<br>
Source: [<a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=suzerz">Mandy</a>]<br><br></p>
 
 
<p>Q. Where is the High Score List located?<br>
A. Right <a href="//www.neopets.com/gamescores.phtml?game_id=342">here</a> or <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/hiscores.phtml?game_id=342">here</a>.<br><br></p>
 
<p>Q. I'm on the High Scores List, but I didn't get the avatar? o_O<br>
A. To get the avatar, you have to be in the Top 50 spots on the high scores list when avatars/trophies are awarded. There's currently a glitch with the Brain Tree (BT) and Kiss the Mortog (KTM) HSTs. If you're on either of those, you won't receive the AC HST avatar.</p>
 
<p>Q. Why does the high score list show SOME people's avatar count +1?<br>
A. Because the high score list counts your Goggles NC Mall avatar towards your avie total, while your lookup does not. However, the Comic-Con 2018 avatar cancels out this effect. So anyone who has the CC2018 avatar will have their count match on their lookup and the HST. Confusing, I know!<br><br></p>
 
<p>Q. If I'm a top collector but I still need one of the Top 50 HS game avatars (<a href="//www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=197">Escape from Meridell Castle</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=885">Maths Nightmare</a>, and <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=801">Korbats Lab</a>) will I bump one of the people trying to get the Avatar Collector av if I make it into the game's top 50?<br>
 
A. EFMC will cause you to bump someone off of the top 50 Av Collector high score, as it has have a lower game ID (and therefore the avatars/trophies for these games are awarded before Av Collector), as far as I know. That does NOT mean you shouldn't go for a new av, however! I always encourage collectors to go after any avatar they can! Other collectors will definitely understand. :)<br>
As for Brain Tree and Kiss the Mortog, it appears that being on these HSTs at reset will prevent you from being in the Avatar Collector HST. So you won't bump anyone off. Hooray!</p>
 
<p>Q. Why are some resets more difficult than others?<br>
A. It mostly depends on how many people have the time to think about reset. Thus resets that occur over a weekend, or during the summer, will be more difficult (i.e. you will need more avies to get the Avatar Collector avie) than you would if the reset occurred in the middle of the week in the winter.<br>It also depends on if a new avatar was very recently released. If most collectors who would not normally reset get a new avatar on the 1st, then the required avatar count will be higher and more difficult.<br><br></p>
 
<p>Q. It's the end of the month. Where is the board?<br>
A. We'll have a board up by the 28th at the latest.<br><br></p>
 
<p>Q. Why do you, Kay, think it's harder for people to achieve this avie now? Why make these boards since 2008, and not before?<br><br>
A. Because, prior to 2008, avatars were being released quite frequently. Thus the top avatar collectors competed for the top slot while they tracked down new avatars. Now, when people start new on neopets, not only do they lack those incredible retired avatars, they also have to work their way up as quickly as possible, while many of the top avatar collectors sit with no new avies to strive for, and thus <b>no</b> competition.<br>
These two problems - no retired avies to boost the new collectors counts, and few new avies to distract the top collectors - have compounded and made it very, very difficult for new avie collectors to achieve the Top Avatar Collector Avie, no matter how hard they might try. Thus, I am trying to help them out by asking people to wait to reset now.

<h1>Charter Reset Board</h1>
 
<p>In June 2018, Kay received several requests for a general Charter awareness board. Of course most people reaching out to Kay already knew about the Avatar Chat reset board, and hoped to spread the word to Charterians. In order to provide broader outreach, Kay and friends decided to focus on both the Avatar high score list, as well as general trophy collecting in the Charter board.</p>
 
<p>Thus was board "Aspiring Collectors - reset day support board!" Like the original Avatar Chat board, this board only appears at the end of the month. We respectfully request that anyone who already has the Avatar Collector avvie and/or a Gold Trophy in any given game, wait until the 2nd to regain their position on the HSTs.</p>

<p>We recognize and support aspiring trophy collectors, and understand that sometimes people miss their mark. All we ask is for the general support of other aspiring collectors. Stop by, chat, and do good things!</p>

<p>Intro Charter Post:<br><textarea name="faqposter2" cols="10" rows="2">
Welcome to reset-a-palooza! What's this board about? Well, not just avatars, but trophies in general!<br>

We, the supporters, cheerleaders, and other neopets enthusiasts, pledge to help aspiring collectors however we can, including by waiting to reset our avatar count and by delaying getting on high score lists for trophies we already have.<br>

Of course there will be some overlap and competition, especially for those looking to upgrade trophies (or go from Top 50 avatar collector to a shiny trophy!). We support your aspirations as well. :*

</textarea></p>

<p>Second Charter Post:<br><textarea name="faqposter2" cols="10" rows="2">
Details about the Avatar Reset specifically in my signature.

We are also fans and friends of the GAMERS board on Charter. If you have specific questions about Games, their board is a wealth of knowledge:

So, what is everyone hoping to accomplish this reset? :*
