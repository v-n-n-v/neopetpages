<h3>October 24th, 2017:</h3>
<b>JS8 is on indefinite hiatus from <i>requests</i>.</b> Premades are still up for use! I just don't have time to be making new custom content right now, maybe in the future. I do intend to continue to make premade content though.
<p>
</p>

<h3>August 28th, 2016:</h3>
No new updates yet guys! I have been on a bit of a summer vacation. Hoping to add some new content soon though.
<p>
</p><h3>August 1st, 2016:</h3>
Requests are closed for now! I will open them up again when I'm feeling more up to it. It the mean time, I will try to get some new premades out for you guys. If you sent in a custom request form, I got it, but it may take me a little while to complete it. Thank you for waiting!
<h3>July 21st, 2016:</h3>
We have had some sweltering hot weather here in Germany the last couple days, so I have been trying to stay off my laptop and have mostly been on mobile. It's supposed to be cooling down though, so I will be finishing remaining requests ASAP! Thanks for your patience. 

<p>
</p><h3>July 18th, 2016:</h3>I'm working on requests as they come in! I just opened up another site, so if I'm a little slow over the next couple days, it's because that is still getting set up. If you have a baby pet go check out <a href="/~eiund">Snuggle</a>, my new directory.<p>

New affiliate, <a href="/~Camhe">GoGo</a>, has been added.
</p><p>
</p><h3>July 14th, 2016:</h3>I have put up a counter on the sitely page, just for fun. I'm still working on new premade ideas, keep checking back!<p> Two new affiliates added, <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Athande">Pebble</a>, and <a href="/~Eyrie98_2">Pascal</a>.</p><p>
</p><h3>July 13th, 2016:</h3>A brand new layout! I want everyone to know JS8 is back and active, so I decided to spruce the site up a little. The old layout felt a bit cramped, so I went for something more wide this time. Hopefully you love it as much as I do! If you notice anything missing or out of place please let me know.
<p>
Three new affiliates were added, <a href="/~iranna">Haley's Fresh Fonts</a>,<a href="//www.neopets.com/~greeeeen_a11"> Simplified</a>, and <a href="//www.neopets.com/~zafiz_05">Quartz</a>.

</p><p>
</p><h3>July 12th, 2016:</h3> Custom requests are <b>open</b>! I'm not having a lot of inspiration for premades right now, so I think I will take on a couple more custom requests. Please remember to read the rules fully before sending in your request form.<p><b>**EDIT**</b> I have added a new section to premades called "faeries". There is now a shield for almost every type of faerie in Neopia! I still need to finish some of the other faeries, like Illusen, Jhudora, Taelia, ect. but all the main elements are done. More will be coming soon!

</p>

JS8 is accepting affiliates and listers, please neomail to have your site listed on JS8! <p>
</p><h3>July 11th, 2016:</h3> All caught-up on custom orders! You can find your order under pick-up. Did you get a conformation neomail from me on your form, but don't see your shield? I may have lost your form. Please send it again! Custom requests are still closed at this time, until I feel 100%. I will try to get some more premades added soon. <p>

</p><h3>July 10th, 2016:</h3> Sorry guys, I'm still getting over my cold! Hopefully I will be back to full health sometime this week and able to finish the custom requests/get some premades out. Keep checking back for updates, once again, thank you for your patients.  <p>
</p><h3>July 5th, 2016:</h3> Very sorry for not updating this last week with any new content. I was on vacation over the weekend. I caught a cold during my vacation, so I won't be doing custom requests right away. I will be working on them as soon as I'm recovered. In the mean time I'm going to go ahead and close requests so I don't get overwhelmed. Once I get the current requests done I will consider opening them again. Thanks for your patience.<p></p><p>
</p><h3>June 27th, 2016:</h3> Two new premades added to "Miscellaneous". There have also been two two new link back buttons added to the sitely area. Yes, I have gotten your custom requests! I will be working on them ASAP, expect to hear back from me soon if your request was accepted.<p></p><p>
</p><h3>June 26th, 2016:</h3> I have had a little art block coming up with premade content ideas, so I'm going to go ahead and open up custom requests for the time being. Hurry in because I'm not sure how long I will keep them open!<br><center>Button site <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Wondeur">Wondeur</a> has been added as an affiliate.</center><p></p><p>
</p><h3>June 17th, 2016:</h3> After another long hiatus, I'm back! I have added three new premades to the "Pet Specific" section. Requests will remain closed for the time being, as I'm not sure I have the time for them, however I'm going to try to work on getting more premades out. Please keep checking back for new content! As always I'm accepting affiliate and listing requests, if you would like your site to be linked here on JS8, please contact me!<p></p><p>
</p><h3>December 1st, 2015:</h3> I apologize for my absence and lack of updates. I have been quite busy in real life and that has left little time for Neopets and JS8. Requests are closed for now, if I haven't responded to your request, I apologize, but I need to take a bit of a break. I will let everyone know when requests are open again, in the mean time, there is a selection of premades for you to use!   <p></p><p>
</p><h3>September 23rd, 2015:</h3> Requests are back open! If you previously submit a request form to me that I have have not completed yet, please send it again. I accidentally cleared some neomails without thinking. I'm also going to work on doing some more premades. Keep checking back!  <p></p><p>
</p><h3>September 7th, 2015:</h3> As promised I have added some more premade shields to hold you over during my three week hiatus from doing custom requests. If you go check out the premade "seasonal" catagory, your will find three new shields. A summer picnic theme, a last day of summer theme, and a fall theme. I have also added a snazzy new fall button, to go with the new fall layout you're about to put up. ;)<p></p><p>
</p><h3>September 1st, 2015:</h3> <b>Requests are closed for the next three weeks!</b> I have family visiting and we will be traveling. I will be opening up requests again once all of that is finished. However, there is still plenty of premade shields for you to use during the wait! I will try to maybe add a few more over the weekend. In the mean time, you're still more than welcome to apply as an affiliate/lister. I may be a tad slow getting back to you, but I should be popping on briefly each day to check neomail and do dallies. <p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>August 29th, 2015:</h3> A new page and a new layout! JS8 Shields has permanently moved from /~Bunnier over here to /~Luncheon. I kindly ask that if you are using a shield by me, that you update any link backs accordingly. I will have a redirect page up on /~Bunnier for the time being alerting people to the move. It became a pain logging into my side all the time to update things, so I figured it was time for a change. To go along with the new page, I have also re-done the whole layout. I hope you all enjoy the changes as much as I do!<p>I'm also seeking to add more affiliates/listers, so please neomail me if you're interested in becoming one! You don't have to be a graphics site, I'm accepting listings for pet directories, guides, ect. Just ask! </p><p>
</p><h3>August 28th, 2015:</h3> I have added a whole slew(9 in total) of new premade shields to both "pets specific" and "random". I'm just trying to come up with ideas for more. If you have a specific theme you wish to see me do, please shoot me a neomail. <p>
</p><h3>August 25th, 2015:</h3> I have added a couple new shields to "seasonal" and "random". More to come soon!
<p>
</p><h3>August 17th, 2015:</h3> Requests are once again open! I have also added a new premades to the "random" and "pet specific" sections. More is on the way so keep your eyes peeled.
<p>
</p>
<h3>August 16th, 2015:</h3> It's been way too long. This place is about to get a face lift and some new content. I cannot believe it's been over a year since I wrote you guys an update, I'm very sorry for that. I will try to keep you updated on the progress of things this time around as I move forward. Requests are still closed, but I'm going to make a few new premades soon. I would love to hear your ideas for what you would like to see for premades. Feel free to neomail  with any ideas you may have! Thank you guys for your support and continued interest in JS8. More is on the way!<p>
<b>**EDIT**</b><br> A new layout is now up! I decided to freshen the place up with a sunflower themed layout. You can find a new sunflower button on the side of the page, as well as in the "linking back" section. Hopefully tomorrow I will have a few new shields added to the new section "pet specific". Keep checking back for more progress updates!
</p><p>
</p>
<h3>April 4th, 2014:</h3> I'm alive! I may be doing some premades pretty soon here so keep an eye out! Not quite ready to open up requests again, but I will keep everyone in the loop when that happens. Thanks for stopping by!
<p>
</p>
<h3>January 27th, 2014:</h3> Life just got really busy and left me with little to no time in regards to working on requests. I'm closing requests for the time being, I apologize to anyone waiting. As far as current requests go, I'm not sure when/if I will get them done. I really appreciate all the requests you guys sent in and it makes me happy that you like my work. I wish I had the time to do every request, but real life is just too crazy right now. 
<p>
</p>
<h3>December 14th, 2013:</h3> Very sorry to those of you who are waiting on requests! I will get to them as soon as I can. I have been quite busy with the holidays coming up and finals last week. I apologize for the long wait and thank you for your patience.
<p>
</p>
<h3>November 23rd, 2013:</h3> I changed the premade section around a bit to hopefully make it easier for people to find what they are looking for. I also released a new shield series based on MMEs. So far I only have one in the series, but I plan to add more soon. If you have suggestions on things you would like to see brought to the premade section, please let me know!
<p>
</p>
<h3>November 17th, 2013:</h3> A couple new premade shields have been added. I have mostly been working on custom requests. Please feel free to submit ideas to me for premade shield designs you would like to see! I would like to get an idea for themes people might be interested in. Remember, I will only do Neopets related shields. 
<p>

</p>
<h3>November 3rd, 2013:</h3> Welcome to JS8 Shields! I'm officially open and taking custom requests. JS8 is now also affiliated with <a href="/~Tines">Silent Serenity.</a> You can find a button for them in the side bar. More premades and on the way, I'm working on them in between custom orders. So please keep checking back for new stuff!

<p></p><h2>DISCLAIMER!</h2>

I do not do layout coding, so sorry if you mess up your layout applying one of these shields, I will not be able to help you fix it. So please be careful when applying any code to your layout! Make sure you save your progress before hand so you don't lose your hard work. 
<p>
Any shield with animation will look best on a <b>white</b> background! They are not transparent to avoid fuzzy/blockiness around the edges from the animation. This is just what happens with the program I use, I don't currently have a remedy to fix it. When I make custom shields, I can change the background color to your liking if you want animation and plan to use it on a non-white layout. Non-animated shields will always be transparent.

<h1>Request Your Own!</h1>
I'm thrilled that you would like to request your own custom shield by me, but there are a few quick rules you need to be aware of prior to filling out your form. Please take a moment to read through the important information below!
<center>
<div class="blocktext"><h4>Rules/Information</h4>
<p></p>
 ✿ I will only make Neopets related shields. Sorry I will not be doing any movie, book, or TV show related shields.<br>
 ✿ You must be willing to allow me some artistic freedom with the design. If you have an exact picture in your head of what you want and are going to be unhappy if I can't read your mind, then sorry, I cannot help you.<br>
 ✿ Credit is a <b>must</b>. You need to put one of my text banners or image buttons on your page if you plan on using one of my shields. <br>
 ✿ I have the right to decline <b>any</b> order. So please do not be upset if for some reason I feel I cannot complete your request. I will not accept all requests.<br>
 ✿ To show me you read all these rules, please put the word, <i>snowbunny</i>, in the "other" section of your form. Requests received without this will be ignored. If you don't have time to read my rules, I don't have time to make you a shield.<br>
 ✿ Please make sure you fill out the form fully! If you do not, you may not get what you wanted.<br>
 ✿ Please be patient, I have a life outside of Neopets and don't have time to be making shields 24/7.
<p>
