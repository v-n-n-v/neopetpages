</div>
<br><br><a href="#astro">Astrology</a> is the study of the movements and relative positions of celestial objects<br> as a means for divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Astronomy itself is the study of the heavenly bodies by defining weight, speed, mass and how that body interacts with the other bodies of the universe. Astrologers take what we know about astronomy, and apply it to human activity. <br>
In the most general sense, astrology is a belief system built on using observation of the heavens - genuine astronomical phenomenon - as a way to predict or understand events in the human world on Earth.<br>
Astrology is one of the most ancient forms of divination. There are many different forms, some  being: Electional, horary, locational and natal. <br></p><ul><li><b>Natal astrology</b> is the study of the individual and the life of said person. In natal astrology we explore the time, place and date a person was born and how that effects that particular individual. Natal astrology is also sometimes referred to as genethlialogy, from the Greek word genethlialogia.</li>

<li><b>Electional astrology</b> is the art of choosing the best moment for any particular project or event. All projects begin with an idea and then are followed by a plan to manifestation. It is based on the concept that information about the nature and course of new ventures can be determined by examining the alignment of celestial bodies at the moment that they begin. </li>

<li><b>Horary astrology</b> is an ancient branch of horoscopic astrology in which an astrologer attempts to answer a question by constructing a horoscope for the exact time at which the question was received and understood by the astrologer. </li>

<li><b>Astrocartography</b> or locational astrology is the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of the Earth. Some relation between zodiac signs and cardinal points is highly probable to have been established for astrological weather forecasts and other purposes of prediction. </li>

<li><b>Mundane Astrology</b>  is a branch of astrology that involves the application of astrological principles in order to study large groups of people, such as cities and nations. Traditionally been applied to the study of natural phenomena such as predicting the weather or earthquakes.</li>
</ul>
In order to map all of these factors, astrologers use something called a chart. A chart is a map of the sky with the planets and heavenly bodies included showing their location. From this chart an astrologer will begin to piece information together and draw conclusions based on the birthday, birthtime and birthplace. The most basic chart is a picture of the sky from an individuals perspective.<br><h2>Astrologic Purpose</h2>
<p> Throughout human history, astrology has been considered a genuine scholarly and academic tradition, and in many world cultures, it has a strong religious significance. The credibility of the "study" of the impact of stars on human events was dealt a serious blow during the Enlightenment era, when the science of astronomy began to bring a number of long-held astrological principles (such as heliocentrism) into doubt. </p>
<p>Today, astrology is typically considered to be pure superstition or pseudoscience, though this does remain somewhat controversial in most world cultures. In Western astrology, as well as a number of Eastern systems, the most heavy significance is placed on Zodiac types. In other words, the position of various stars, heavenly bodies, and constellations at the time of a person's birth, but there are numerous other variables that are measured and evaluated by astrologists and enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Though many of these different Zodiac types are relatively old, with key principles and measurements dating back even thousands of years, some have been developed more recently, and even attempt to combine an ancient understanding of the zodiac along with a more modern interpretation of cosmology.
</p><br><h3>Neopian heavenly bodies</h3><br>
The stars are our eternal companions here in Neopia, whether as guides, the subject of myth or harbingers of disaster. And there is always more waiting to be discovered!
<p><b>Stars</b><br>
Although they look like points of light to us, stars are really giant burning spheres of gas like our own sun. Stars come in several different colors, corresponding to the heat with which they burn. From coolest to hottest, they are red, yellow, blue, purple and white. With the exception of the twelve known constellations, the Neopian stars appear to change position rather drastically depending on who holds the telescope. This phenomenon is still unexplained!
</p>
<p><b>Kreludor</b><br>
Kreludor is Neopia's one and only moon, visible by night (when there aren't tremendous laser battles, that is). Although its atmosphere is thin and its gravity slight, Kreludor is home to an entire pet species, the Grundo, as well as a host of ferocious rock beasts and lava monsters. The primary industry on the moon is Kreludan metal mining, conducted by evil Sloth Drones and a kiiler guardian robot. Steer clear!</p>
<p><b>Virtupets Space Station</b><br>
Home to the villainous Frank Sloth and his army of mutants, this space station is always lurking about in geosynchronous orbit somewhere over Tyrannia. Visit if you dare, but stay away from the mysterious lever . . .</p>
<p><b>Mysterious Satellite</b><br>
Nobody really knows what this satellite does, but it keeps zooming around through the Neopian sky, always watching . . . Some say it's the command center of Sloth himself, where he fled after being defeated by the Space Faerie.</p><br><br><span style="font-size: 20px;"><a href="/~Draiyad" title="The Dragon Dimension">See more about Neopian Universe here.</a><br><p><br></p><br></span>

<h1>. Dragonian .</h1> <br>
The Dragonic Zodiac is another system of determing personality traits and features that may affect one's outlook on life.
<p>Everyone our has a certain astrological frequency that dictates the energy of their life. By reading the time of day you were born or asking someone what time they were born, you can get a quick clue as to what you or they may be like. The day is divided into twelve time units, periods that dictates bioenergy of the soul and their character traits given by the clock of their birth .

Your metal is copper and veryhealing in nature. You must learn to be like your metal, beautiful and healing, while keeping a silent tongue when vitriolic sarcasm wishes to spring forth.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ehonrIb.png" style="border: 0; float: left; padding: 5px; margin-bottom: 25px;"><p>It's a mystery which culture created the zodiac first. While earliest astrology was used to bring a sense of order out of apparent chaos, it was soon utilized to predict weather patterns, primarily for agricultural purposes. It was eventually broadened to include forecasts of natural disasters and war and other events in the course of Neopian affairs. Amassing successes in these fields, it was a natural progression for astrology to be used as counsel for kings and emperors and, in time, for all of us.</p>
<p> The number one physical mechanism by which celestial bodies affect our body and brain is gravity. If you mention to a skeptic the 'lunar tides' phenomenon, that alone explains a lot. If the Moon creates tides in the oceans and atmosphere, then why can't we go beyond that and see that the Moon create tides in Neopets, Petpets, and nature. We are very much liquid. Our brain consists of 78% of water. Our bones consist of 22% water.</p><br><a name="alt" id="alt"> </a>

        Very few Sleepers are famed in the world of Neopia, simply because they keep to themselves.
        Sleepers are mysterious people who can outwardly appear cold and distant. It is their
        nature to be reserved when they first meet people. Once you get to know them, however, you
        will find that they are people worth knowing. Sleepers are wise beyond their years and have
        a deep and philosophical understanding of the world around them.<br><br>
        Sleepers are pros when it comes to managing their finances. (In fact they are adeptly
        talented at anything involving math!) Some of the richest people in Neopia are Sleepers.
        However, you would never know it since they are secretive about their wealth status! (Go figure!)<br><br><br><center><i>Famous Sleepers</i><br>

        Dreamers are optimistic people. You can easily spot a Dreamer in a crowd of people because
        she is surrounded by many friends. Dreamers are the social butterflies of the zodiac.<br><br>
        Dreamers are very generous in all aspects of life. They are warm, friendly, and
        affectionate. Their lifelong dream is to spread peace throughout the world. Dreamers are
        the type of people that give to charities, donate to the poor, and are first in line to
        volunteer at the Soup Kitchen.<br><br>
        Dreamers are constantly looking for inspiration for their next creative endeavor. A Dreamer
        has an eye for beauty and detail like none other and her Neohome is like a work of art. Her
        pets are always groomed and well-dressed and she has the beauty contest trophies to prove

        Gladiators are confident, energetic, and have a never-ending thirst for adventure. They tend to surround themselves with people that share their passion for life.

        Hunters believe in playing by the rules. They enjoy working in teams but naturally end up
        holding important leadership positions. They are crusaders of justice that stand firmly by
        their beliefs.<br><br>
        Hunters are great listeners and they have a keen memory. At times, they may appear rather
        quiet but they are merely pondering the consequences before they act or speak. Hunters
        rarely make mistakes but when they do, they will be hard on themselves for it. Hunters are
        perfectionists.

        Waves tend to come across as very shy at first. It may take some time before Waves open up
        to you.. but when they finally do, you will discover that they are the most genuine and
        caring souls around. Waves are very intuitive and are quick to sense when something is
        wrong. They will always lend you a shoulder to cry on.<br><br>
        Because they are so in-tune with their emotions, Waves often make brilliant poets. Waves
        are very sentimental and enjoy writing letters and visiting friends. They treasure every
        gift and token.<br><br>
        Waves tend to either keep to themselves or interact with a small circle of extremely close
        friends. They are protective of their friends and family and would do anything for them.

        Protectors are destined for greatness. They are born leaders with unmatched bravery in
        battle and their magnetic charm will win over countless followers. But although a Protector
        may realize his potential early on, he is likely to spend a lifetime endlessly struggling
        to fulfill his purpose. This is because Protectors are never satisfied with one single
        deed; they must achieve multiple victories and successes before they will finally feel an
        ounce of gratification.<br><br>
        The great Protectors of Neopia include remarkable heroes such as King Coltzan III and
        Jeran, the savior of Meridell. It would seem that people born under this sign live rather
        charmed lives. For a Protector, victory is never far from reach. Their thirst for power,
        glory, and honor is the force that drives them through each waking day.<br><br><br><center><i>Famous Protectors</i><br>

        A person born under the sign of the Gatherer can be best described as having all the
        intuition of a Wave and the benevolent heart of a Dreamer. In short, they will touch many
        lives, demonstrate that actions are more powerful than words - and inspire many in the
        process.<br><br>
        Gatherers will naturally draw in followers but they will also turn them away in a matter of
        minutes. While they enjoy the company of others, they are extremely modest and will
        dissuade any form of flattery. They do not feel that they are worthy of such a following
        and prefer to work alone.<br><br>
        Gatherers are inquisitional. As children, they ask tons of questions - and throughout their
        lives, they will never cease to question the world around them. They tend to gravitate
        towards any activity that will present a likely challenge. Guided by their hearts, they
        will attempt to solve every problem they encounter and succeed - most of the time!<br><br><center><i>Famous Gatherers</i><br>

They like to surround themselves with a company of friends and close companions.<br><br>

<h1>. Introduction to the Elements .</h1>
<p>There are four basic elements present in nature: Fire, Earth, Water, and Air. The elemental faeries acquire all of their magic from these four basic elements. And because good and evil exists in nature, faeries of Light (good) and Dark (evil) also came to exist. Light faeries acquire their magic directly from the Sun while it is speculated that Dark faeries acquire theirs from the aura (or perhaps the "evil nature") of humans and other living creatures. While faeries of Light strive to maintain life, Dark Faeries seek to destroy it. <br>

Only the most powerful faeries can harness power from more than one element. Fyora the Faerie Queen uses a combination of air &amp; light magic and it is rumored that the Dark Faeries Ilere &amp; Jhudora possess knowledge of earth magic.


More food for thought: Perhaps Fyora was originally an Air Faerie that turned to Light and Ilere &amp; Jhudora are fallen Earth Faeries that turned to Darkness.<br>

Some believe that the world of Neopia would cease to exist without these magical creatures. Each element is needed to keep nature in a perfect balance.</p>

Air Signs - indicate changeability, expediency and versatility.<br><p>Air natured Neopets are carefree and do whatever they want. They are respectful and loving toward others. Air signs have a free spirit and love to be outside. Typically not someone to sit down, but goes outside and explore. They like to be alone at times but can't without others indefinitely. Air natured Neopets are calm and realistic. They long to be free of needs.<br>
The biggest challenge for every individual marked by Air is to find grounding and understand the importance of their body. They have a strong tendency to remain in higher spheres, where everything is lighter and seems possible. It is not easy to find a way to implement their ideas, intelligence and knowledge into practical things and truly make them alive.<br><br>
This is the element that connects all other elements, even though it might seem less relevant, invisible as it is. The distance from the nature of Earth lifts us up high, in impractical and mental planes that don't satisfy our physical needs. Still, this is the element that can be found in all others, keeps the fire going just like the Sun burns hydrogen. We may say that the beginning of life wouldn't be possible without Fire, but there would be no Fire on our planet without Air.<br></p><br><br><br><br><p class="c1"><a href="#elem">⇑ Up ⇑</a></p>

Water signs - indicate sensitivity, interdependence and intuitiveness.
<p>Water natured Neopets are a simple, kind and calm personality. Patience is one of their primary traits, but they are also shy. Not always comfortable around others, but when around friends they are comfortable with, Water signs can be outgoing. Mostly a thought person and rarely acts before thinking asituation through thoroughly. Most at home in the water, complete free and content. Loyal friends and can always reliable, but Water natured Neopets must remember to be themself, even around persons they are not really comfortable with.<br><br>
This is the element of constant movement, but slow and steady, swirling inside each of us and holding on to its mystery. This is the element of conception and death, of illusions and fairytales, holding the secret to our Soul - its beginning and its end. <br>
In the element of Water we literally deal with matters of life and death, of our genetic inheritance and all of our ancestors. Strangely, this is also the element of emotions. We all have to understand that our emotions have already been lived through by someone in our family tree, and they are passed on from generation to generation, mostly through the role of the mother.</p><br><br><br><br><p class="c1"><a href="#elem">⇑ Up ⇑</a></p>

 Fire signs - indicate energy, enthusiasm, a sense of superiority and competitiveness.
<p>Fierce is an apt word to describe Fire natured Neopets. They are fun and charismatic. Always the center of atention and loves to be seen. Life is a adventure for them and the do whatever they want. Fire signs become easily angry, but is quick to makes up. A passionate soul and always wants to prove themselves right. A Fire natured Neopet can seem hard on the oudside but is tryuly soft on the inside, if they would just show that side of themselves more often. <br>
Fire signs apprehend the world through their intuition, they trust their gut instinct (or they should anyway) because it rarely ever leads them wrong. Fire people have a strong sense of self just like fire which has no regard over anything in it's path, fire people are quite self centered but they are moving so fast that they never get stuck on themselves<br><br>
When speaking about the element of Fire, we have to keep in mind that this is the only element that shines. Water can sparkle, that's true, but only if it reflects the light created by Fire, whether a campfire or the Sun as an enormous fiery celestial body. <br>
This is the element that represents energy itself, and even though there is a lot of earthly energy in the element of Water, it cannot be compared with the amount of energy that lives in the Sun, even though they might be equally important to the human race.</p><br><br><br><br><p class="c1"><a href="#elem">⇑ Up ⇑</a></p>

Earth Signs - indicate deliberation, stability and dependability.
<p>Earth Signs are practical and realistic beings. They don't believe in fairy tales, but sometimes forget not to destroy others beliefs. Not complicated, but can be overly blunt, also known for your kindess. Earth signs are not sone who likes to be alone, but prefers to be with others.Earth natured Neopets are typically quiet person and are good with the other elements. They enjoy being outside and love the woods.<br>
It is instantly obvious that this practical sign that values material things, works hard, and knows how to make a plan and put it to action. They have the ability to be specific and concrete, expecting everyone else to share their practical view on the world and their reasonable approach.<br>
Earth elements are hardy, pragmatic, wise and brimming with common sense. They're good at solving puzzles, and can't abide with too much excitement or the foolish breaking of laws. They can be stubborn, but they're intensely loyal.<br><br>
Earth is the fundamental component of physical structures, of all solids, of steadfastness, of order. Rocks and bodies alike are made of earth, but by itself, earth is not capable of movement; that's where the other elements come in. Earth represents matter itself, our physical body, and with it our finances, the food we eat, and our daily routine. Earth does not change. It stays there and allows whatever is growing to continue to grow and progress.</p><br><br><br><br><p class="c1"><a href="#elem">⇑ Up ⇑</a></p>

Light Signs - indicate sociality, positivity and acceptance.
<p>Peaceful by nature, calm and positive and pure. Light natured Neopets  try to see everyone's good side and most of the time they succeed. They are a rather cheerful person and aim to please others. Light elementals treat everyone respectfully, and that is why they are so liked by others. Light natured Neopets love the sun and it is a way to calm them down on the rare occasion of an upset. As a sensitive person, they are in touch with the inner self and are not afraid to show emotion. Light elementals have a hunger to be liked by everyone, but they need to remember that it isn't possible to be everyone's friend. They are socially more accepted it's easy for them to have a "positive self image" within them and thus attract a more positive reality.<br>
 Light natured Neopets are extroverted in nature and love the aspect of communicating with other people. Most are highly talkative. They love working in groups and are naturally inclined towards jobs that involve team work.<br>
 By their nature, they prefer "sugar coating" their words instead of being blunt, or in the face. They usually come across as being more compassionate. They usually take up a lot of social causes and are more "community oriented" than other signs.<br><br>
Light is the essence of life, and the bringer of calm. It has no form or substance, but can be felt upon the skin, usually as a form of warmth. It is not tethered to any one thing, and can eminate from fire, the sun, or a soul. Inner light can be extinguished, but it is contagious and will continously grow until it outshines every other element.</p><br><br><br><br><p class="c1"><a href="#elem">⇑ Up ⇑</a></p>

Dark signs - indicate control, ambition, and desire.
<p>Dark natured Neopets are mysterious, strong and independant. These personality treats make them feared by others. They are a unique person, but not always evil or even bad. Dark signs have an intense longing for power and control. They need to remember to use those desires wisely. Power isn't the only thing they desire, Dark natured Neopets also thirst for knowledge. If a dark sign wants something, they will do anything for it.<br>
Dark natured Neopets do not often show their emotions and only reveal themself to the ones they truly trust, these are the lucky ones, because dark signs would do anything for the they care about and love. Dark natured Neopets are really protective, albeit possessive, over their loved ones.<br>
Dark signs prefer keeping to themselves a lot more than being "out there" in the society. One main reason being that their very nature is to be self-centered rather than being society-centered. Less prone to having a "smiling" exterior, may not come across as being "warm", are less likely to give "hug" when meeting others and prefer to keep an aloof exterior.<br>
Dark natured neopets are naturally prone to be create a reality where they can have a dominant leadership - be it in their relationship, career or social circle. They are naturally "dominant" and prefer the company of people who are allowing of their dominance. <br><br>
Darkness has been defined as the absence of Light. It's essence is the bid for domination of others. Darkness, as an element in its raw state, has no form. It is like Fire: can not be touched, has no weight, no defined shape. What separates Darkness from Fire is the way each one is used.<br>
Darkness is not tied to any material body, thus making it impossible to raise its strength by adding more of such matter or lower its power by removing some of the nameless matter. This leads to the second reason: there is no way to extinguish it. </p><br><br><p class="c1"><a href="#elem">⇑ Up ⇑</a></p>

<p>Hidden in the mountains north of Altador, this culture is strong on traditions and following the natural order of things. Shenkuu is a very peaceful city, and you can often find yourself lost as you wander through the tranquil mists. The landscape surronding the empire is rather inhospitable. It is located in the mountainous region west of Neopia Central, and north of Altador. There are a number of fast flowing rivers that snake down the mountains, and grassy areas have grown up by their edges-blocked-s are often named by landmarks, such as Mountain-in-the-Mist. The orchid species Selerium Taniverens grows in small amounts in Shenkuu.</p>
<p>Much of Shenkuu's culture is based upon the moon, with the Lunar Temple being a focal point as it tracks the movement of Kreludor. Every year, Shenkuu celebrates the Lunar Festival as an alternative to the new year festivals elsewhere in Neopia. Although the Lunar Festival normally happens in the first few months of the Neopian Year, the exact timing is based on the cycle of Kreludor and as such the date varies. The celebrations include fireworks, Snorkles, and dressing up as Cyodrakes.

In Shenkuu, it is believed that tangerines bring good luck.</p>

Personality traits for the people born in the year of the Juma are intelligent, charming, quick-witted, practical, ambitious, and good at economizing as well as social activities. The weaknesses are that the Juma are likely to be timid, stubborn, wordy, greedy, devious, too eager for power and love to gossip. <br>
Neopets born in the year of the Juma are outgoing, optimistic and highly adaptable in any environment. They are not the people who haggle over every ounce but stay at ease under all circomstances. So, they are easy to be liked and helped by others.

Juma people are endowed with the power of acute observation, anticipation, and visionary power. You can get a validation from an old saying among the boatmen – 'Jumas leave (or desert or forsake) a sinking ship' which means the Juma can aware that the ship will be wrecked and run away in advance. Also, for a factory, once there are rats run out one after another, it predicts the fire damage is coming soon. Because of the ability, the Juma people are usually good at some creativity works. They can be artistic creators, inventors, innovators etc. However, they should not rely on this power to deal with things completely. Think hard and ask for the opinions from others are very important.</p>

Usually hard working, honest, creative, ambitious, cautious, patient and handle things steadily. On the negative side, Blurgah might be stubborn, narrow-minded, indifferent, prejudiced, slow and not good at communication.<br>
No matter how terrible the surroundings are and what other people say, Blurgah usually go forward to do things step by step and finish finally. They like to think hard and ponder repeatedly for a long time before taking actions. Because of this, they are thought to be the kind of people thinking too much and too much questions. However, once Blurgah begin to act; they will carry it off courageously without a hitch and rest. The disadvantage for them is that they lack of the flexibility ability to adapt to changes in the market. They usually insist on holding by their decisions and would like not to change which shows to be stubborn in other people's eyes.</p>

A symbol of bravery. People born in the year of the Biyako are friendly, brave, competitive, charming and endowed with good luck and authority. With indomitable fortitude and great confidence, the Biyako people can be competent leaders. On the other side, they are likely to be impetuous, irritable, overindulged and love to boast to others.<br>
The Biyako is active, full of valour and vigour in nature. They usually act actively but with caution. Once speaking out, they will never regret. Also, they never give up halfway until reach the goal. Although loyal to friends, sometimes they are thought to be not sophisticated enough as they like to stubbornly and arbitrarily cling to their own courses. They would not blame fate and other people but try to overcome when meeting obstacles in career.<br>
Biyako like going straight. They would go straight forward instead of using some diplomatic means to overcome difficulties which usually make others unpleasant. But they can still finish the task at last. The talented Biyako people are ambitious and never satisfied with the general working environment. The shortcomings for them are that they usually act independently, and don't take colleagues to heart as well as looking down upon them.</p>

Faeries are tiny magical creatures that live in Neopia. Meeting one is said to be very lucky indeed, and there are many different types of faeries with differring powers, abilities and temperaments. Faeries are magical beings who sustain the land and confer blessings on its inhabitants. They look like winged human women, except for the aquatic faeries, who look like mermaids.<br><br>
Faeries live all over Neopia, often functioning as tutelary spirits for various lands, but are most associated with Faerieland. This magical realm once floated on clouds above the ocean, but now resides in a crater of it's own making on the surface of Neopia. <br><br>
The Faeries are ruled by Fyora, the Faerie Queen. Most faeries are associated with one of the six magical elements: Earth, Water, Air, Fire, Light, and Darkness. Each of these camps of elemental faeries are associated with certain talents and temperaments. <br><br>
Faeries are usually renowned for their benevolence and for the blessings they confer, ranging from nourishing food for the poor to increased combat abilities to your choice of a new paint colour. Many of these blessings are offered as rewards for completing quests on their behalf. This apparent act of kindness has another motive, however. The Faeries use items from quests to strengthen a barrier spell that keeps an army of Wraith monsters from flooding into Neopia.<br><br></p>

<br><br><br><h3>How to view a being's Aura</h3><br><ul><li>This exercise is designed to see Aura for the first time and/or practice seeing Auras. Choosing good conditions is important: not only you see the Aura better, but also to gain a confidence about what you see.</li>
    <li>Situate the person in front of a very softly illuminated PLAIN WHITE background. A color background will change Aura colors, so you need additional knowledge about combining colors. Some combinations of background and Aura colors may cause misinterpretation problems.</li>
    <li>Choose ONE SPOT to look at. The middle of the forehead is VERY GOOD. This is a location of so called Brow Chakra or the Third Eye. In some cultures (India) they put a mark on a forehead. Such a mark in ancient times could mean the invitation to look and see the Aura.</li>
    <li>Look at this spot for 30 to 60 seconds or longer</li>
    <li>After 30 seconds ana<i></i>lyze surroundings with your peripheral vision, while still looking at the same spot. <i>Continuing the concentration is most important. Resist temptation to look around.</i> </li>
    <li>You should see that the background nearby the person is brighter and has a DIFFERENT color than the background further away. This is your own perception of the Aura.</li>
    <li>The longer you concentrate, the better you will see it.</li>
