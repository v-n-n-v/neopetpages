<div class="headercontent"> <b>Need help reducing your file sizes to fit BC and/or AG limits?</b> You've come to the right place! I've made tutorials for exporting in both <a href="#PS">Photoshop</a> and <a href="#CSP">Clip Studio Paint</a>. </div> 

<div class="block"><a name="PS"></a> <h2>Photoshop</h2>
<center><b>Disclaimer:</b> I use a very old version of Photoshop, CS4. Hopefully your version will be similar enough to follow the basic principles.<br><br><br>

I save using the Save for Web and Devices function, rather than the Save As<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/70bmm6I.jpg"><br><br><br>

Here is the screen that comes up when saving for Web and Devices. I've highlighted the relevant areas for reducing file size.<br><b>A</b> is the anticipated/target file. This file is currently far too large for the AG/BC, at 300 KB.<br><b>B</b> is the target image size. This will automatically fill in with whatever dimensions you made your file, but can be adjusted on this screen. As you can see, this image is too big. It can't even be fully shown in the preview screen.<br><b>C</b> is the quality you want to save your file at. 100 is the highest quality, 0 the lowest.<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/H0GuLEZ.jpg" width="700"><br><br><br>

The first thing I do is resize my images. Sometimes I draw them in 600x600 px to start with, but most of the time I make them larger to give me more room to work with, and then size down. Here, I set the width to 600 pixels (the largest size the AG recommends), and it automatically adjusts the height to match. If your piece is taller than it is wide, adjust the height to 600 and let the width auto-adjust.<br>
As you can see, just resizing the image already cut the target file size in <b>A</b> to 125 KB -- about half of what it was at full size! And you can now see the whole image in the preview. But it's still too big for the AG/BC
<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3GbizRv.jpg" width="700"><br><br><br>


After resizing, I then go to <b>C</b> and adjust the quality. Depending on the detail in the piece, I usually bring it down to somewhere in the 80s, but if it's a simple drawing it could be in the 90s, or a complicated drawing will need to go down to the 70s. <br>
If you look in <b>A</b>, the anticipated file size is now 75 KB. That's perfect! I always like to aim for the mid-70s, because this is only an estimate and isn't entirely accurate. I've saved files that said they were 78 KB, and they came out 81 KB -- just slightly too large for the AG. Saving at 75 KB estimated allows for some leeway so I don't have to re-save again smaller.
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/oTgpS3Z.jpg" width="700"><br><br><br>

And that's it! Enjoy your compressed image, and submit it to the BC or AG so that the rest of us can enjoy it too!</center></div>

<div class="block"><a name="CSP"></a> <h2>Clip Studio Paint</h2>
<center>
I save using the Export (Single Layer) function, and for files I'm submitting to the BC/AG I select JPEG.
<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/myKD69U.jpg"><br><br><br>

After selecting the file name/location, this window will pop up. I've highlighted the relevant areas for reducing file size.<br><b>A</b> is the quality of the file. I don't usually futz with this, since it doesn't have an estimate and there will be another window later that does have an estimate. <br><b>B</b> is the target image size. You can either resize it by scale to the original size, or by pixel. I like to aim for 500 or 600 pixels as the largest dimension.<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/B80zvLu.jpg" width="600"><br><br><br>



After you have adjusted the image size, hit OK. A new window will pop up, which will preview your export to the size you've selected, as well as give you another opportunity to adjust the quality. You can see here that at 100% quality, my file would be far too large to upload to the AG/BC, at 340 KB. Just keep reducing the quality number until the estimate gives you somewhere in the low 70 KB range.

And that's it! Enjoy your compressed image, and submit it to the BC or AG so that the rest of us can enjoy it too!</center></div>
