My name is Donuhts and I am a Cybunny.  I am a very lucky Cybunny with a great owner called 
<b><a href='//www.neopets.com/randomfriend.phtml?randomfriend=sarakat4'>sarakat4</a></b>.  This is a rather fetching picture of me that was taken quite recently.  
As you can see I have beautiful big eyes, just like my mother.

So why are <b>Cybunnies</b> so great?  Well for one we are unique. I mean what other species 
can be turned into a <font color=green><b>MUTANT</b></font> and still look cute?  Have you even SEEN the Mutant Aisha... now they 
are just plain <font color=brown><b>HIDEOUS</b></font>!!!!

<b>My Personal Views</b><br>
Ok so some of you may not agree with me, but oh well, this is my website so there :P
<p>
<center><font color=orange><b>CYBUNNIES DON'T JUST EAT CARROTS!!!!</b></font></center>
<p>

There I have said it.  Maybe someone will take notice.  Im sooo sick of people making dumb 
carrot jokes.  I don't have anything against carrots as such, but I mean, come on, they are just 
carrots... Its not like they are the greatest food in the world.  Not like Beef Rouladen hehehe ^_^
<p>
Now maybe this is just me but aren't Slorgs the greatest petpet ever?  They are totally loyal, can't 
run away, don't chew up your nice new furniture and leave a handy slime trail behind them so you 
can always find them no matter where they go.

So do you want to know a little bit more about me?  Well, I enjoy reading and 
I'm sooo looking forward to going to Neoschool when it eventually opens.  sarakat4 
has been going frantic trying to find out more info about it so I know I will be one 
of the first pupils :)
<p>
When I am not reading I like to test my strength in the Battledome.  I know I am not 
exactly the toughest pet in the battledome but with a strength of 7, I'm not 
doing bad either.  Plus it is absolutely hilarious when I do win against a so called 
'tough' pet like a Grarrl.  They get so embarrassed. HAHAHAHA

Well I hear sarakat4 calling me so I have to stop writing on this webpage now.  If you want to find out 
more about me or possibly arrange a friendly Battledome match send <b><a href='//www.neopets.com/randomfriend.phtml?randomfriend=sarakat4'>sarakat4</a></b> a Neomail.
