<b>31/05/2013 3:50:01 pm NST</b> I'm currently in the BC, I thought I'll try and goldban my last pet on my main. It's Koryuui's turn and I've stuck his BC entry on his petpage, <a href="/~Koryuui">/~Koryuui</a>. It's been a while since I updated this and for that, have my most sincere apologies. I've been getting Shine back on track. I started with a good 'ole quality check. Some icons weren't quite up to scratch, I have improved quite a bit over many years and some of the icons were positively ancient. But instead of scrapping them completely, I've been remaking them. I have a temporary archive set up at /~calymara for all the old icons. That's it for now, I want to get back to BCing!

<b>10/12/2011 4:27:01 pm NST</b> Sorry really doesn't feel... adequate enough. But it will have to do. /hine has been a little neglected and I have no excuse really. I've been home from uni for a week now. But my bumper update will make feel a little less guilty. /
<br>
I am planning on opening another site. A dolling site. After dabbling again in dolling, I've realised just how much I enjoyed making the little fantabulous creations.  But it will take ages and ages. for me to make all the bases and dolls.The site is probaly going to have an art section as well, maybe dolling contests (or whatever) as well. I've already got a name for it but I'm not telling. Feel free to neomail any guesses. If you happen to get it right, I'll make a custom doll/graphic (within reason).
<br>And another thing, this update was at 1am on 10th but it was technically the 9th on neopets. D8
<b>26/11/2011 12:51:33 pm NST</b> Hi people! I've got some good news. Term ends in less than one week now. How awesome is that? I will admit I think I'm going to miss the lectures and what not (even the essays to a certain extent!). <br><img src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y297/rosie_bunny/doll1.png" style="float: left; margin: 2px;"> To the left is a preview of a doll I started earlier. I'm also making the base myself. Considering my dolling skills are rather rusty, I'm rather proud of how she's looking so far. She's a witch if you can't tell. ;P
<br>If you want to know why the update was late, blame the fact I had an essay to write, a presentation to do, a practical write-up, two dissections, yadda yadda yadda. T'was a busy week.  <br><b>15/11/2011 2:01:15 pm NST</b> I've got less than three weeks to go before it's the winter holiday but I have collections (college exams) when I get back so I've got a lot of consolidation and revision to do. My tutor hinted - well, near enough outright stated - that we're going to be busy. Fun times ahead! But I know for a fact that I will have no work at all during the three months I have off in the summer.<br>
On a Shine-related noted, I've got an idea for the next layout drafted. It will be annoying to code and blah blah blah. Maybe it will be worth it. Oh, I don't know.<br><b>22/10/2011 1:22:27 pm NST</b> Oh my goodness gracious gastropods - when they said the terms were intensive, they weren't kidding. On Monday, I was given a week to read both Gould's Wonderful Life and one of Conway Morris' works (The Crucible of Creation was the one I picked) and then write an essay with a pretty vague title. One or two books and essay a week seems to be the current theme on top of the ten hours of lectures and the three hour practicals I have. <br>
But I can't say I hate it, because I don't. It's seriously an amazing experience so far, even if it's a little busy. Really, really. <br>I might even try coxing next year.<br><b>09/10/2011 11:57:53 am NST</b> Hi folks, so, freshers week at uni for me is drawing to a close - and what a busy week it was! But sadly, my timetable for this term looks horrible. I think it's going to be 40 hour weeks for the next eight weeks. So I think until I adjust to the new workload and what not, requests are going to be closed. I will still try to update when I can but if I don't get the chance to, don't worry! ^^
<br><br><b>25/09/2011 12:20:47 pm NST</b> When did September become the months of requests? Three lookup requests, an art request and some other stuff I can't recall off the top of my head at the moment. I'm not complaining, I'm just surprised since before September, you could probaly count all the requests I got before this month on one hand or something.<br>Anyhow, just a week now until I'm off to uni. It still hasn't hit me. I still need to pack my things and the fact my room has been cleared out, ready to be redecorated, is not very helpful.<br>Urgh, I'm too tired at the moment. I've entered a pet in the BC on a side and that's keeping me busy.


<br><br><b>01/09/2011 2:05:47 pm NST</b> Busy, busy, busy. That has how real life has been for me. It's shocking! It's horrible! It's downright despicable! I haven't had much time with my beloved internet and it's been eating away at my soul! <br>Maybe I'm being over the top, but still!<br>Anyhow, results day was two weeks ago. I jumped, danced and laughed (it might've been closer to crackling but I dunno) - in that order. I got the grades to get into first choice university, a part of me still doesn't believe it. Since then, I had a whole heap of forms and order forms and stuff like that to fill and send off. Not to mention all the other stuff I have to read! Then there was a few real life problems.
<br>Here's hoping September is a quiet month.

<br><br><b>12/08/2011 2:00:47 pm NST</b> Did I actually mention why I want a holiday? I don't think I did. Hmm, the reason is mainly because I've been super busy (for me anyway) and ill. Not a combination I'd recommend any time soon unless you want to skive off school. Then I might recommend it. <br>But I wouldn't actually recommend skiving off school anyhow. Except in certain circumstances. Like the Fridays I've had for like the past year. One lesson that was at the end of the day but I still had to go in for nine. Waiting around for five hours with nothing to do, every week without a fail for months... It's okay to skive the odd Friday lesson. Although, I never did.<br><b>08/08/2011 2:24:47 am NST</b> I need a holiday. Okay, more want than need but hey! Who cares? No update today but it is 11pm and I don't want to have to decide if I want to go by Neopets-time or England-time. 
<br>So as I was saying, a nice holiday. Just a day in an open field, a light shower of rain, an umbrella and wellies. I like listening to the gentle pitter-patter of rain.<br>
Things in real life has been a bit err-ish. So hectic and busy... At least my chubby collie has been a little sweetheart. An annoying sweetheart, mind you, but a fluffy and adorable one. Even if he's leaving hair everywhere because he's shedding his coat.
<br><b>17/07/2011 4:30:17 am NST</b> I don't know why but my recent updates seem to be a bit pathetic in my view, I didn't even bother with an update yesterday. I blame my headache and the complete lack of a desire to do anything but stare pointlessly at whatever. <br>Eh. I got a new pet, Hirrivi, isn't she lovely? I sorta officially outed my secret lurking account, _evil_genius_222. I also have a chomby and a cybunny on that account that I don't know what to do with. Je suppose c'est la vie pour vous. Urgh, je vais dormir maintenant. Réveillez-moi quand c'est demain s'il vous plaît? Merci et au revoir.
<br><b>11/07/2011 6:11:40 am NST:</b> Last week was bit busy - I had entered Synod into the BC despite only having him for a day or two. He's been goldbanned and he was 13th overall, not bad for a quick drawing on Friday morning. Only Koryuui is left to goldban on my main and I want the picture to be spectacular.<br>
Anyway, I still have no mouse and it's seriously getting on my nerves now. Eh, I'll live, won't I? I'd like to think I've managed to cope pretty well without one.<br>
I'll be adding a wider a range of backgrounds soon-ish and actually add a coat of shiny gloss to the request page. I was sleepy and a bit grumpy when I made it so yeah. 
<br>I was going to write more but my dog is being positively adorable and he wants a fuss. Toodles!
<br><b>28/06/2011 12:47:06 pm NST:</b> Yo! This entry is going to be a tad on the long side. I still no mouse sadly.  My internet connection has also been a bit of see-saw, one moment there's the euphoria of having a fast connection and the internet at my fingertips followed by the moments where it all comes crashing down when it poofs. It's been driving me batty if I was honest. I have thought about going on a temporary hiatus until the internet is playing nice again but I won't! That would be admitting defeat... and I wouldn't last five minutes before going back on the internet.<br>
Moving on, I might add banner bases. I don't know yet. Requests, requests, requests - still dithering about that. I'm thinking sign and banner requests. Pick size/font/image/colour/blah blah blah.
<br>And multi-coloured diagonal striped backgrounds can be such a pain! Sure, they can look nice but still! That's so not my point. <br><b>20/06/2011 4:36:12 am NST:</b> If you're wondering about the sudden expansion of backgrounds over the past few days and colour variations of existing backgrounds, well, my mouse died on me (the poor thing!). I could use another mouse but it's really just not the same. I had a tiny little mouse and I'm so used to using it that everything else just gets on my nerves. I will be getting a new mouse and hopefully I can find one that's the right size. I'm using the touchpad on my laptop, it annoys me but it's the lesser of two evils. At least it's easier to zoom in/out and the touchpad does have smoother scrolling than the mouse.<br>Aussi, expect a new layout at the end of June or start of July.

<br><b>14/06/2011 3:37:29 am NST:</b> 

Okay, so Shine might be getting a new layout in July - one with windmills maybe. I honestly don't know what's with me and windmills lately. There was that icon, then button, now user lookup... Oh well. Windmills are cool. Like Fezzes. <br>And I think that's it. Unless you want to count the guide about drop down menus I'm planning on writing, that is.<br><b>31/05/2011 1:56:21 am NST:</b> 

Just two banners today, I think I need to start expanding that section. It looks rather small. Anyway, Shine has now now been listed at even more directories and is currently looking for affiliates. Requests are still set to open up in July for the summer, however I was thinking of having requests and layouts on different page, a different site and have Shine as a sort of umbrella site. In other words, I want to make a layout but I want to keep Shine's current one. It would certainly help shorten the loading times and just updating, it's bad enough as it is to add stuff to some of the sections!  

<br><br><b>21/05/2011 08:27:44 am NST:</b> 

Thank you to everyone who voted for Teahae! She now has a spiffy gold trophy that will keep her from robbing stuff for a few days and she won't be stealing any votes for a few months at least (three cheers for the gold ban). She was also placed tenth overall. Next time, I think I might aim a little higher. <br>I've started a range of Altador Cup icons, I've only got five so far but hopefully I'll have one for each team. <br>It's also nice to know that I've inspired people. It's a very nice way to start a day.<br>Oh and my internet connection has been rather temperamental lately, very annoyingly so.

<br><br><b>14/05/2011 05:05:24 am NST:</b> Hey, guess what? I need people to vote for my shoyru! So vote, pretty please with a cherry on top? She's a little thief and she's been stealing votes left, right and centre since the contest started. Misakeigh is now goldbanned, whooo! I'm not allowed to enter her until the 3rd September. That seems like such a long way away! Shine has been growing steadily. I might be adding a requests section once all my exams are done - July in other words.

<br><br><b>09/05/2011 07:55:44 am NST:</b> It seems like I've increased my update rate, I think I'll try to keep it that way. Lately has been a bit busy, I entered the BC, so vote for meh cybunny plz? I've been posting BC spam since early Saturday morning, the views for Shine shot up and hit 100, I'm not going to miss any brilliant BC spam opportunities. 

<br><br><b>01/05/2011 11:31:41 am NST:</b> Sorry for the lack of updates recently. I've just had a lack of drive to do anything. So to make up for that, I made Shine a brand new layout! I drew the picture a few days ago and I was just waiting for the chance to use it for something nice.<br>I just need to out the finishing touches up and there we'd go! It'll be all done. Bust sadly, I need to add a bit more coding (in the CSS mainly) and add a nice bit of polish to some of the sections (like the entire 'other' bit).</div>
