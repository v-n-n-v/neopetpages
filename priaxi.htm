 UC TRADING GUIDE</h2>
						<p>Well hello there! I'm Rainy. I've been on Neopets essentially since I knew how to type, and I've been trading pets almost as long. You're probably here because you are looking for some guidance on trading UC, or unconverted, pets. I'll do my best to give you some tips that will make the process easier.

</p><p>

<strong>Remember that everyone has different preferences, and everyone's trading journey is unique. If you are feeling frustrated, take a break and focus on something else until you feel ready to trade again. Neopets should be fun!</strong></p>

Note: all example pet names are just for the purposes of this guide and are not intended to make fun of any pets which happen to have the same name. I also do not claim to own any of the pet names mentioned here. Lastly, I am an English-speaking person, which shapes my perception of foreign RN and RW.<p></p><p>

						<h2>Pet trading is subjective!</h2><p>
 This guide is a compilation of opinions from many different users, but it is by no means law. The best way to learn about UC trading is to watch it happen. This guide is simply meant to help you on your way.</p><p>

FAQs</h2>
				
<b>What is an UC pet?</b> UC pets use "old", pre-conversion artwork. When conversion happened, for reasons unknown, it did not apply to some pets. TNT didn't fix their mistake (if it was even a mistake in the first place...) so even today, there are pets with the old artwork floating around!<p>

<b>Why are UC pets so desirable?</b> Many users seek UC pets because they prefer that artwork to the new, post-conversion artwork. Additionally, there is only a limited number of UC pets in existence, so even the most common UC is still more rare than any converted pet. That being said, many users still enjoy post-conversion art. Not everyone wants UC pets - but, that's not why you're here...</p><p>

<b>What is an UC shuffle?</b> A shuffle is a fun way to trade UC pets at a faster pace. <a href="/~Syiin">Check out my guide on UC shuffles!</a></p><p>

						<h2><br>Lingo</h2>
				
<b>UC/Unconverted</b><br>
UC pets use pre-conversion artwork. There are a limited number of UC pets out there, and their artwork is very popular, which makes them desirable for pet trading.<p>

<b>Tiers (T1, T2....T10)</b><br>
At <a href="/~Maureen">/~Maureen</a>, a tier system has been created to "rank" UC pets in terms of rarity, popularity, etc. Tiers are not law and you should trade for what you want, but the tier structure is important in most of the UC shuffle formats.</p><p>


<b>VWN, WN, DN, BN, VBN</b><br>
Name formats which mean very well named, well named, decently named, badly named, and very badly named (Please see <a href="/~Maureen">/~Maureen</a> for more info on name formats)</p><p>

<b>RW/RN/MS</b><br> Real word, real name, misspell</p><p>

<b>3L, 4L, etc</b><br> Three letter name, four letter name, and so on.</p><p>

<b>Cvc, Cvcv, Vcvc, etc</b><br> Notating your pet's name format using "C" to represent consonant and "V" to represent vowel.</p><p>

<b>i/L Misspell</b> Because of the font used on Neoboards, a capital I (as in ice) looks like a lowercase L (as in lowercase). Thus, capital I can be used in place of lowercase L in a name, and visually it is the same.</p><p>

<b>SBD/HSD</b><br> Starter/semi battledome stats; combined health, strength, and defence stats. Generally around 300 HSD (health strength defense) is considered SBD (semi or starter battledome). Even stats are the most desirable. <a href="/~Applebean">Click here</a> for Applebean's BD to PC guide, a BD pet trading database.</p><p>

						<h2>Getting Started</h2>
				
				
So you decided you want an UC pet! Maybe your goal is in T2, T7, or T10. Your goal is attainable no matter what it is. With patience, persistence, and a little luck along the way - you will get there.<p>

<b>Let's start at the very beginning...</b><br>

Contrary to popular belief, you do not have to have an UC pet - or even a RW, RN, or 4L pet - to start an UC trade chain. You could pound surf for a nice name (the most popular names are short and feminine) or create one yourself. Save up to offer a custom with your pet or train it for the BD for a while.</p><p>

Offer your VWN basic pet on other converted pets. Try to improve your pet's name with every trade. Color and species generally matter much less than name.</p><p>

At the same time, offer your converted pet on quiggled UCs in shuffles.</p><p>


<b>I want to offer on UCs, but how do I know if my offer is fair?</b><br>
Well, ain't that the question. Remember that trading is extremely subjective. What one person would trade the moon for, the next person might snub. That being said, here are some very general guidelines on fair trades.</p><p>


<i>4L names that have no vowels</i><br>
Like Vtkz, Lpws, or Hgrt are not trading for UCs.</p><p>

<i>3L names that have no vowels</i><br>
Like Mqw, Pjr, or Ctb, are sometimes trading for VBN T1.</p><p>

<i>Uncommon, plural, and foregin RN/RW</i><br>
Names such as Thermocouple, Hamstrings, or Cortacesped (that's lawnmower in Spanish) might trade for VBN T1-2.</p><p>

<i>RWs that are more common but have less character potential</i><br>
Names such as Aforementioned, Gabbiest, or Tapering might trade for DN T1-VBN T2.</p><p>

<i>4L names that have at least one vowel and are pronounceable</i><br>
Like Devt, Ubfi, or Nixt are trading for DN T1–BN 3. Depends a lot on the name and if it is "cute" or not.</p><p>

<i>RNs that are less common or misspelled, but still recognizable as a RN</i><br>
Uncommon spellings such as Gabryelle or Alixsander are desirable and might trade for WN T2– BN T4. The further the stretch, the lower the tier to expect.</p><p>

<i>i/L Misspells</i><br>
Perhaps one of the more polarizing MS out there, a name like Holly (with two capital I) might trade for DN T5-6. But a name like Exceptional (again with two capital I) might trade for DN T1–2. There is high supply and low demand here.</p><p>

<i>4L names in Vcvc format</i><br>
Names like Inik, Epin, or Olet are trading for WN T2–3.</p><p>


<i>4L names in Cvcv format</i><br>
Names like Cava, Sori, or Hefe are trading for VWN T5–7.</p><p>

<i>Commonly known foreign RN or RW</i><br>
Such as Pedro, Esperanza, Alejandro, Fleur, or Fiesta might trade for VWN T7–9.</p><p>

<i>3L names with one or more vowels</i><br>
Such as Res, Pim, Gee, Emm, or Haw are trading for VWN T8–10. Again depends on the "cuteness" factor.</p><p>

<i>Correct spellings of RWs that have good character potential</i><br>
Like Rumor, Savannah, Crochet, Illuminate, or Horror, will trade for VWN T8–10.</p><p>

<i>Correct spellings of common English RNs</i><br>
This is the tippy top of RN trading. Names like Emily, David, Ashley, or Taylor will trade for VWN T9–10.</p><p>

<i>Names that fall into multiple desirable categories</i><br>
Such as Lola (RN and Cvcv), Tip (RW and Cvc) or Rose (RW and RN) generally trade very well, VWNT9–10.

						<h2>Trading Up</h2>

Once you get your UC, here are some general rules of thumb to help you "trade up" - progress to higher tiers and/or better-named pets - rather than "down.<p>

• Assume that to go up one tier, you will go down one name format. For example: VWN T1 trades for WN T2, DN T3, BN T4. This is a squishy rule based on the popularity/rarity of your pet. The same also applies in reverse. Only drop a tier for a better name format.</p><p>


• Avoid names with numbers, especially those with numbers at the beginning or middle. Underscores are generally more tolerated than numbers.</p><p>

• Do not list in shuffles unless free pass. This will prevent you from having to make a less than ideal trade.</p><p>

• It's generally not worth it to go from VWN to VBN unless you're jumping at least 3 tiers.</p><p>

• Pets with another species in their name won't trade as well.</p><p>

• Pets with funny names like onion_breath or LupeTheGoop have a certain charm and may be appealing to users even though they are not VWN. Same goes for framed or edgy names like xx_Panic_xx or xXx_Rox_Sox_xXx (remember when we all used to think that was so cool?)</p><p>

• Pretty compound names such as Bluefeather, Starryrain, or Lunarmist are popular with a lot of users as well.</p><p>

• It's always a great idea to make a board asking for advice or ask a trusted friend if you aren't 100% sure about a trade.</p><p>

• If you have a pet that is popular within its tier (see see <a href="/~Maureen">/~Maureen</a>) avoid trading for an unpopular pet within the same tier.</p><p>


• Never trade for a pet you aren't OK with having for a while.</p><p>

• Jumping from UC to converted pets is a high risk but high reward strategy. Be careful!</p><p>

• Don't forget...it's OK to make a bad trade! In the moment you might feel like you ruined your trade chain. With time you will be back on track.</p><p>

<div class="type" id="Etiquette">
						<h2>



Etiquette</h2>
				
In your UC trading journey you will come across a lot of unspoken rules. Well, here they are, not so unspoken anymore!<p>

<b>Don't beg.</b> Don't ask other users to give you their pets or demand they trade with you. This includes making boards such as "Help me trade up!" or "UFT for literally any UC" or "Seeking the worst named UC faerie kau on the planet." Can't we all agree this just isn't a cute look?</p><p>

<b>Don't ask for VWN one tier below your VBN pet OR a "worse named higher tier" for your VBN pet.</b> use a little common sense. That's just...not how it works.</p><p>

<b>Offer any and all converted pets on quiggles in shuffles, but only offer fairly on a user's board.</b> Shuffles are meant to be a free-for-all and listers won't mind what would typically be seen as "underoffers" during shuffles. But be more conscientious of offering fairly on someone's board.</p><p>

<b>If a user specifies what they're seeking, don't offer something else.</b> It's frustrating, and downright rude!</p><p>

<b>Stop it with the longshots.</b> Unless a user has said they're happy to entertain all offers, don't offer your VBN T2 or bargain bin RW on a VWN T10.</p><p>

<b>If a user asks for posted offers only and no Neomails...don't Neomail them.</b> This should really be self-explanatory.</p><p>

<b>Dont offer the same thing on a VWN T3 and a VBN T2.</b> Why would the other user ever accept your offer on their "better" pet when you've offered on a pet with "lesser" value?</p><p>

<b>Don't use real life scenarios to cause guilt.</b>I'm sick, trade with me to make me feel better" or "seeking UC plushie kougra memorial pet for my childhood cat" not an effective marketing technique.</p><p>

<b>If your name is a misspell but could easily be misread as a correct spelling, indicate that it's a misspell.</b> Pickle and Pickel are two completely different "values" but someone could easily mistake Pickel for the correct spelling. This is also a MUST for i/L misspells because they look so similar on boards.</p><p>

<b>Don't try to guilt another user.</b> Saying "I would permie!" or "That's my dream pet!" to try and guilt another user into choosing your offer is gross. Don't do this at all, but especially if you don't mean it.</p><p>

<b>Posting "I also bid __ if you didn't see it</b> when shuffle listers don't put you on their SL. It's extremely unlikely they didn't see your offer - they just aren't interested. Now you've put them in the awkward situation of having to say no to you directly and publicly - and, you're making yourself and your offer look bad.</p><p>

<b>Offering, being accepted, then saying you need to consider.</b> If you offer on someone else's pet and they accept, you trade. You don't make an OTB board or ask to consider; you offered in the first place.</p><p>

Trade Chains</h2>
				
<b>If you are just starting out on your UC trading journey, you may feel like you are not making progress, or you might not be able to imagine how you will trade up to your goal. These are real trade chains - my own - which show how you can start with a converted pet and end with one of your favorite UCs!

It's worth noting I trade a lot more slowly than other PCers, so your trade chains might not take this long.</p><p>
