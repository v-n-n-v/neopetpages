<h1>Petition for Accessible Neocash Unconverteds</h1>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/7G8eCZ6.png" class="divider">
For a long time, the Neopets community has desired unconverted pets. Many of us endured the torture of penny trading to obtain our dream UCs, but others couldn't make it. Now is the time for everyone, not just the few privileged with time or trading talent, to achieve their dreams. While it is tempting to try to hold on to UC exclusivity, keeping UCs rare will not help the people left behind by pet trading. For the happiness of the community, Neocash UCs must be accessible to everyone.
</div>


<div id="why" class="section">
<h1>Why We Need a Petition</h1>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/7G8eCZ6.png" class="divider">
Why do we need to sign petitions about Neocash UCs? Why not just trust TNT to create them in a way that satisfies the community?

Recall that when pet slots came out, many users were disappointed that the pet slot item itself was <b>not tradable</b>. This meant that pet slots were more difficult to apply to side accounts, and impossible to obtain through trades for those who preferred not to purchase new Neocash. While TNT swiftly promised to make the pet slot item tradable, we have no idea when (or if) this will happen.

There are other site features that needed much more community input as well: Neocash gift boxes, Neocash capsules, the Battledome, Charity Corner, and even the conversion itself.

TNT shows a pattern of:
1. Only rarely surveying the community for input on new features
2. Not changing or slowly changing the features after they've already been made

<b>We need to make our voices heard when they will have the most influence: before NC UCs are created.</b> With that in mind, please consider these requests for the design of Neocash UCs.
</div>

<div id="requests" class="section">
<h1>Our Requests</h1>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/7G8eCZ6.png" class="divider"><center><b> We would like the new NC UCs to be:</b></center>

<h2>1. Affordable</h2>
<b>We would like each unconversion to cost no more than 1000 NC (roughly 10 USD)</b>
Many of us want multiple UCs. The cheaper the cost, the more UCs we will want to buy and the happier we will be with this feature. Additionally, a lower price will help make NC UCs available to Neopians in countries with an unfavorable NC exchange rate (such as Brazil and Mexico).

<h2>2. Available</h2>
<b>We would like to buy the NC UC item directly from the shop</b>
Releasing the NC UC item through random chance/capsule mechanics would make it difficult for users lacking NC trade fodder to obtain, and would cause much frustration. Please allow us to purchase the NC UC item directly from the shop.

<b>We would like the NC UC item to be available to <i>everyone</i> in the NC Mall</b>
Specifically, we would rather <b>not</b> buy the NC UC item from the Elite Boutique. The Elite Boutique items are available only to accounts ages 49 months and older, and are no-trade. Selling NC UCs through this method would disallow gifting the UC item to friends, exclude young accounts from making their own UC for more than <b>four years</b>, and <b>incentivize break-ins to aged accounts</b>. Furthermore, many users have lost their original accounts, and their account age does not reflect how long they have played. <b>Please do not do this.</b>

<h2>3. Tradable</h2>
<b>We would like NC UCs to be tradable between accounts</b>
Enabling us to trade the NC UCs to different accounts would make moving NC UCs between our own main/side accounts much more convenient.

<b>We would like the NC UC item to be tradable</b>
If the NC UC item were tradable, it would appeal to users who prefer to trade NC items. It would also help users gift the NC UC item to their friends.

<h2>4. Permanent</h2>
<b>We would like the unconversion to be applied to the pet permanently</b>
The alternative idea, a UC "skin" which could be removed and transferred to other pets, would use gift boxes when moving pets between our accounts. Also, NC UCs with temporary skins would seem "fake"â€”we would like our pets to <i>be</i> UCs, not just look like them.

<h2>5. Identical Art</h2>
<b>We would like NC UC artwork to be identical to their original UC counterparts</b>
We would rather not have a color-swapped (e.g. Dyeworks) or modified version of the original UC artwork; our dream pets are the original UCs. We would prefer having the original art to keeping current UCs exclusive.

<b>We are open to a marker distinguishing original UCs from NC UCs</b>
Some of us are interested in a note or trophy to mark original UCs as different from Neocash UCs.

<h2>6. Paintable</h2>
<b>We would like to use Neopoint morphs/paintbrushes for the species/color</b>
We would like to morph and paint the Neopet into the converted version of the pet, then "unconvert" it with a Neocash item. Tying the NC UCs to paintbrush prices will help NC UCs remain something that takes in-game effort to obtain, rather than something we can buy with real money immediately.

<h2>7. Expansive</h2>
<b>We would love to own certain auto-converted pets</b>
(Nice but not required)

At the time of the conversion, certain species/colors were selected to be UCs, but certain others were converted automatically (e.g. the old Royalgirl Zafara). The community would be <i>incredibly</i> excited to have these additional old-art pets. While quite a few colors had pets that experienced the auto-conversion (Baby, Faerie, Halloween, Maraquan, Mutant, Robot, Royalboy, Royalgirl, Sponge, and Tyrannian), the community would be most excited about auto-converted pets from the Faerie, Maraquan, Royalboy, Royalgirl, and Tyrannian colors. Alternately, you could poll the community for their top auto-converted requests, or make it a slow/ongoing release.
