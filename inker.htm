<h5>
<b>WELCOME TO RE:CREATION</b>, an annual intensive character development workshop. This 60 day event will help you finish an impressive petpage, cleanly and beautifully showcase your character, and earn custom event trophies for your pet!</h5>

<h5>II WILL BE BACK TODAY JUNE 15!!!!!! Send to me and not Sunny. Sorry for no forewarning. I just got released yesterday and am still struggling but I'm ready to get back to you!</h5>

Please mail forms <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=hazarcl">here</a>.</div><br><b>
If the event has already started, don't worry, just hop in now!</b><br>
It's okay to register late. It's okay to submit Challenges late.<br>
Life is chaotic, so it's set it up so you can just do what you can.<br>
One manageable Task a day will add up quickly to a flashy page!<br><br><br><p>
Do you have a character you have a basic idea for, but no idea where to begin or what you want to do? Do you have a character you worked hard on, lost inspiration on, and are struggling to continue?  Do you love your pet's name, but still need to figure out what you want the character to be? If you answered yes, this event will help you renew your creativity.
</p>
<p>
How will this event help you, you wonder? The basis is a timed and point driven event. Each Challenge will give you three Daily Tasks and three days in which to complete them. How quickly and thoroughly you complete the Daily Tasks will net you a number of points for that Challenge. The idea is to keep you motivated while giving you no time to lose focus and let the character drift. While intense, you're sure to end up with something fully developed and brilliant!
</p>
<p>
Need more incentive beyond the pride of completing a character and a detailed petpage for your character? Trophies! There will be trophies available to all participants, special trophies awarded based on overall points, and even specific Challenge based trophies! You will also be able to work on cooperative Challenges with other participants to give and get art, whether drawn or written, for your pet!
</p>
<p>
Still interested? AWESOME! Please <b>read the <a href="/~inker#facts">F.A.Q.</a></b>, go <b>browse the <a href="/~inker#chal">Challenges</a></b>, and join in! <b>Send registration</b> to <a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=hazarcl">Nobody</a>!</p>

<h1>frequently asked questions</h1>

<b>Oh no, day 1 passed, I missed the registration window!</b>
<p>No, you didn't! You can join and still earn points at any time in the 60 days! (You can even join after the event has ended, or work on another character after the event has ended, which is covered at the bottom of the F.A.Q.)</p>
<b>
May I sign up and join in after the event has already begun?
</b>
<p>
Of course! You'll have missed the potential to earn full points on any Challenges past the deadlines, but you're absolutely welcome to begin at the current Challenge, or even complete previous ones for partial points! You will still be able to earn plenty of our event trophies. Though, of course, the biggest reward is the results of your hard work shown as a completed petpage!
</p>

<b>
I don't think my content is good enough.
</b>
<p>
You are wrong! NO PART OF RE:CREATION HAS TO BE PERFECT. Ever. It's all supposed to instigate ideas and get us excited! There's no way to fail. There's only many doors for you to open and explore.
</p>

<b>
Other people are doing more than me...
</b>
<p>
That's fine! You're only challenging yourself. Do what you feel will be enough for you to work on your character. This is about your progress. Feel free to ask others in group chat if you need inspiration, motivation, advice, or other help.
</p>

<b>What if I don't think I can keep up, or I can only do some Challenges?</b>
<p>
You can join even if you don't think you'll be able to stay caught up to current deadlines! You can still get some trophies by even participating in five Challenges, and more if they're ones for specific trophies. This event is not a contest. The only one you'll challenge in yourself. Don't see it as a competition that you need to complete, and don't compare your progression to that of other participants. Do what you feel able to do. This is about your own progression, even if it's just a little step forward, on creating your character.
</p>

<b>
Am I allowed to use a character or petpage I started before the event began?
</b>
<p>
You're welcome to do this event with a character you've already started, whether it was years ago, or in the weeks leading up to the start of the event. Have it slapped on your page when the time comes, and that's dandy. Submit each Challenge form on the due date as we go along!
</p>

<b>When do I send in my Challenge Submission form?</b>
<p>
Send it in by that Challenge's due day if it's complete or if you want to submit it as incomplete to earn full credit for the Daily Tasks portions you finished. If you didn't complete any Daily Tasks of the Challenge in time to turn it in on its due day, at that point just wait until you complete it and turn it in as late to receive partial credit.</p>

<b>May I send in my Challenge submission early?</b>
<p>If you'll be at work, school, on vacation, in the hospital, or are worried you might otherwise miss the deadline if you don't send it as soon as you finish, then you may send it in early.</p>

<b>May I send in my Challenge submission late?</b>
<p>Yes, for partial points. Special cases mentioned below.</p>

<b>Do I send a neomail when I complete each Daily Task?</b>
<p>
Nope! Challenges are submitted by the Challenge deadline to be evaluated for the three Daily Tasks within that Challenge. </p>

<b>Do I need to complete each Daily Task on the day it's for?</b>
<p>Nope! If you want to turn in that Challenge on time, you have until the third day of that Challenge to finish all those Daily Tasks, which means you could do all three on the last day if you felt like it, or weeks early. You don't necessarily have to do a Daily Task on its listed day.</p>

<b>
Is it okay if I work ahead for Challenges that haven't begun?
</b>
<p>
If you have the time to work ahead, that's great, and you're welcome to do so! Be cautious of balancing your offweb priorities and mental resources, and make sure you take time to stretch and rest your eyes!
</p>

<b>The Challenge is due tonight, and I only got 1 or 2 of the Daily Tasks done!</b>
<p>
Turn it in tonight, and the Daily Tasks that are complete will get full credit. In this case, add the word Incomplete to the title of your submission neomail. The incomplete or missing portion will receive partial or none, but can be resubmitted later for a chance to add points. To send additional content finished post deadline, add Makeup to the resubmission neomail title.</p>

<b>
May I get an extension for a Challenge or particular Daily Task?
</b>
<p>
There will be no extensions. However, you are absolutely welcome to turn it in late, or if the deadline hasn't passed, then simply submit the Challenge as incomplete! Turning in incomplete or late will give you less points, but you'll be able to keep rolling. If it gets to the point where you don't think you can keep up and cease participation, you'll still be awarded points and trophies based on how far you've come at the end of the event!
</p>

<b>Did you get my Challenge submission form or did my neomail glitch?</b>
<p>If the next Challenge has already begun and the host hasn't responded to your Challenge submission form for the prior Challenge, feel free to mention it on the boards or try to send another neomail. If you explain that you completed your Challenge and submitted it on time, the host will score you accordingly! Ain't nobody got time for lying about timeliness on a character development event that's only meant to challenge ourselves, after all!</p>

<b>I completed my Challenge on time, but something happened and I couldn't turn it in!</b>
<p>If you're in a situation like this, send a neomail about it. You don't have to go into the details at all. Your submission will be judged as submitted on time if something came up in your life that prevented you neomailing the Challenge submission form even though you had actually completed the Challenge on time.</p>


<b>
There's so much more I want to do, and I don't think I'll finish on time!</b>
<p>Try to cover the minimums of the Challenge so you can submit on time, and then you can flesh it out when you have time to spare. Even if you only get your basic thoughts down, that will help you readdress and rework them later. RE:CREATION is set up as a springboard for your ideas, as a way to flex and grow your creativity. The expectation is that much of this may be raw, and that you'll be inspired to keep going and fully form your ideas even after the event has ended, and in turn inspire other neopians to do so. There's no expectation of perfection. Don't push yourself beyond what is emotionally and physically healthy. If you feel overwhelmed, then just set yourself up for future expansion.</p>

<b>Uhhh... I don't think you scored me right...</b>
<p>If you see something that doesn't look right in the way your submission was scored, feel free to send a neomail asking about correction or explanation. If it was a mistake, it will be corrected! If it's something the judge decided, that will be explained, and if there was any misunderstanding about what you submitted and you think that you fully met the needs of the Challenge and should have received more points, you'll be given a chance to explain your thoughts. If there was a misunderstanding, your score will be updated to reflect the correct score accordingly. If the judgement remains, please accept that gracefully.</p>

<b>May I enter with more than one pet at a time?</b>
<p>
While you may take on as much trouble as you desire, it is strongly advised you enter with only one pet, or a max of two during the event itself. This event is very indepth and time consuming. You will struggle with completing some of the Daily Tasks if you're juggling two or more characters. The choice is yours, but it will be helpful to give your full focus to one character. If you choose to do two, Challenges will be judged for each of them, so they can each earn trophies, and for Champion tallies the points you earned on either will be added together.
</p>


<b>Could I earn more points with a second character?</b>
<p>
Possibly. Your scores will be added together in the final total at the end of the event when working towards the Champion trophy. But scores shouldn't necessarily be your primary motivation. This event is about character development, so keep your ability to work on your characters in mind!
</p>

<b>
What if I want to switch which character I'm using?
</b>
<p>
If that's what you think will work best for you, go ahead! Just send a neomail to the host to swap out your character in the participants section. You will retain any points you earned in previous challenges with the character you'd used. For the character you've switched to, feel free to either continue with the next challenge where you left off before, or jam out the prior if you have the energy for it. There's no penalty. It's entirely up to you!
</p>

<b>Do I need to own the pet I'm making a character for?</b>
<p>Nope! You can use any /~petpage for your character, regardless of whether that character relates to that pet. Your character can be for a pet you'd like to one day own, a pet that doesn't exist, or even a character you have offneo or offweb. Though, if you don't yet own the pet for your character, there may be some Daily Tasks that will be difficult or cause you to give vague answers in response. No points will be deducted if you don't own the pet.</p>

<b>
Does my character have to be neorelated? What about other influences?
</b>
<p>
Nope! Your character can be your own original content, related to neo, or even inspired by other media as long as you don't engage in copyright issues. However, exercise caution if you're going with darker, troubling themes, and follow TNT guidelines and rules for filters and content. This may force you to edit or leave out some backstory or information, but keeping the freeze ray away is priority.</p>


<b>Can I join with a character for an adoption application or project page?</b><p>
This is completely up to you! While there is no harm in using the event to help with a pet application, keep in mind the potential dead end if you aren't chosen to adopt that particular pet. You risk putting in a lot of work for a pet you'll never own, though you can always adapt this work to a future pet. For project pages, this may be exactly what you need to inspire you to reach your goal! Decide this on your own, but you're more than welcome to work towards those dreams. </p>


<b>Do I need to know how to draw, design, or write well?</b>
<p>
There is no need to be a master at an artform to participate and earn points! While there are Daily Tasks that involve drawing, designing, and writing, there are always alternatives to doing these by yourself if you're struggling. It is suggested you give every Daily Task a go, because even if you're embarrassed or shy there's much value in trying and learning, and you shouldn't compare your creative journey to that of others, but most Challenges will give you the option to find help elsewhere! More than anything, the host wants you to realize that regardless of your experience level, whether your art is written, drawn, or designed, you are an artist, you are creative, and you're capable of amazing creations!
</p>


<b>
May I participate in another language? What if English is not my first language?
</b>
<p>
No worries there! Feel free to participate in the language you are most comfortable in! If English is not your primary language, feel free to mention this to your editors when it comes time to get input from other participants. Regardless, this will not effect your points or participation trophies at all! 
</p>

<b>Does my page navigation have to be in the same order as recreation challenges?</b><p>
You can organize your content and order your navigation however you like! It can be in any order at all. If you want to list it by the Challenge titles or numbers, you can do so, of course! Do whatever makes sense for you and your character, or whatever makes it easier for you to follow along in the Challenges. If you think the judge will have a hard time finding your entry content for a particular Challenge, just add instructions to the notes section of the Challenge Submission form.</p>


<b>
Is it okay if I make fanart or want to offer my editing services early?
</b>
<p>
Sure thing! If you're making fanart, that can count for one of your fanart Daily Tasks in Challenge 20, and you'll get the fanart trophy then, although one of them will still need to be the user above you. If you're offering editing for another user early, that's also great, and it will earn you the editor trophy, though you'll still need to review the user above you during Challenge 19 to earn credit for that Challenge.
</p>

<b>
Can we help one another? Can I help write, draw, code, etc for someone else?
</b>
<p>
Yeah!
</p>

<b>
Can I make buttons or other graphics or stuff for RE:CREATION?
</b>
<p> 
That'd be swell. Please send your contributions to <a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=hazarcl">Nobody</a>. You will be credited.
</p>

<b>
Can I make or suggest other resources to add to the resources tab?
</b>
<p>
Sure! Send a pm with your offer or suggestions!
</p>

<b>The group chat is about to explode or has exploded. What do we do?</b>
<p>At the bottom of the #history tab you should see formatting for the thread title and for the first two posts. If the host is not around to remake, then the first RE:C member who posted on page 25 who owns a Neoboard Pen should use this format to make a new thread to continue the group chat.</p>


<b>
What if the event has already ended and I want to participate?
</b>
<p>
Go ahead! Until the last day of 2023, you can message Nobody to discuss postevent participation. If you still want to participate to earn the 2023 trophies, there's more information on late completions at the bottom of the trophies section. Some trophies will not be eligible after the event has ended. However, starting in 2024 you'll have to wait until the event begins again to participate.
</p>

<b>Now I want trophies for other characters now...</b>
<p>Sweet! Then start working on your other characters and neomail the host to discuss what you're doing to earn a particular trophy. If it's past July, you won't be able to earn Enthusiastic, Champion, or Finisher for those characters, since those trophies are time sensitive to the event, but you can get any of the rest by meeting their qualifications as long as you get them before the last day of 2023.</p>

<b>What if I'm reading this during the year 2024?</b>
<p>RE:CREATION is an annual event, so start looking to preregister in July and get ready for the new look of 2024 trophies.</p>

<b>I keep seeing what looks like acronyms or slang. What's this jargon mean?</b>
<p>Char is short for character. RE:C is short for RE:CREATION. D## stands for Day and the following number is the mentioned day out of the total 60 RE:CREATION days. CH## stands for Challenge number out of the total 20 Challenges. Don't feel silly or shy about asking in group chat if you don't understand something!</p>

<b>
Hey, you have a typo or error or you listed my pet wrong or something looks weird or unfinished or broken?
</b>
<p>
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Please send a neomail to <a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=hazarcl">Nobody</a>.
</p>

<b>Is the information I post on my petpage safe?</b>
<p>
Heck no. TNT could wipe your page at any time if something weird happens, like a glitch, or a reversal. Save everything. Save often. Also, make sure you're only putting things on Neopets that you don't really care if they get stolen. OBVIOUSLY sign and watermark images. But TNT can technically use anything you post on neopets whenever they want for any reason. The TOS we agree to is their way of stealing while legally not stealing, which is why you sometimes see them officially release things people made, without explicitly asking for consent. And that's besides the awful people who steal your work and claim it as your own. Just save often, don't throw anything you want to publish professionally in here, and put up warnings on your page telling people that it was created by you and to not steal your stuff. These are things you should always keep in mind when making stuff for neopets pages.</p>

<b>
I have questions that aren't answered here! What now?
</b>
<p>
Feel free to post your questions on any of the boards and the host or other participants may be able to answer, or privately neomail your question to <a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=nobodyaiheart">Nobody</a>.

<h1>scoring</h1>
				
<p>Each Challenge lasts three days, and is worth a set amount of total points determined by the difficulty of Daily Tasks assigned for each of those three days. Scoring is based on whether each daily Task is completed, how well the submission meets the Task criteria, and whether the Challenge was submitted on time. Meet deadlines to maximize points! Additionally, completing 10+ Challenges fully and on time will earn you a special Finisher trophy!</p>

Challenge scores are determined by adding up achieved points for their individual Daily Tasks.<br><b>Completing on time earns full points. <br>

Late Challenge submission takes off 5 points.<br>
Incomplete Task halves that Daily Tasks's points. <br>
Missing Task awards non points for that Task.	<br></b>
<br><br><p><b>example 1:</b><br>
day 1, worth 5, meets Task goals completely (5 points given)	<br>	
day 2, worth 5, meets Task goals completely (5 points given)	<br>	
day 3, worth 5, meets Task goals more or less (5 points given)	<br>	
Challenge 1 turned in on time (no points subtracted)	<br><b>as a result:</b>	all 15 points given, and on the way to a trophy!
</p>

<br><p><b>example 2:</b><br>
day 1, worth 5, meets Task goals completely (5 points given)	<br>	
day 2, worth 5, meets Task goals completely (5 points given)	<br>	
day 3, worth 5, meets Task goals more or less (5 points given)	<br>	
Challenge 1 turned in after the deadline (5 points subtracted)	<br><b>as a result:</b>	only 10 points given instead of the 15 possible!	
</p>	

<br><p><b>example 3:</b><br>
day 1, worth 5, meets Task goals completely (5 points given)	<br>	
day 2, worth 5, missing or barely started (no points given)	<br>	
day 3, worth 5, meets Task goals partially (2.5 points given)	<br>	
Challenge 1 turned in after the deadline (5 points subtracted)	<br><b>as a result:</b>	only 2.5 points given instead of the 15 possible!	
</p>


	<br><br>	
With this scoring system we hope to encourage you to take full advantage of the event!		
However, we understand that life happens, so we hope you will keep going even if late!		
Your creations and event trophies will be something you can look back on with pride. ♡

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome to your premade code for Re:Creation. Made lovingly by Sunny (Hzoo_26). Within this intro I'm gonna explain a little bit about how to tweak the code to your liking.</p>

<p>First, let's talk about backgrounds and stuff. If you wish to swap out the background for a different one, I have a good selection over at <a href="/~protester">Resource</a> for you. You can also find some at <a href="/~xaia">Whitespace</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Cecira">Lolwat</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Flinkley">Page Decor</a>, and <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Felleia">Silent Serenity</a>. If you need an easy way to make sure your hex codes match whatever background you desire, if you use Chrome I suggest the <b>Colorpeek</b> extension to help grab colors from pictures. I will also be hanging around the re:creation boards so you can also ask me to make you a background if you have a neopets background you wish to use and you can't find it at Resource or one of the pages above.</p> 

<p>The sections are all based off of the prompts/steps from <i>/~Inker</i>. Feel free to add/remove sections if you desire. I also added a div at the bottom so you could possibly add a float as I did in this example layout. I have floats at <a href="/~protester">resource</a> but you can also find a few at Page Decor and Silent Serenity too. </p>

<p>His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of that, I can assure you, he informed me himself.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer. "Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.</p>

<p>Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself. "You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy  -disallowed_word- textarea)

<h1>trophies</h1>
<p>
Trophies will be awarded based on participation. The trophies you have earned should be listed in your score chart, and if you think you've earned more through various Challenges or content you've completed outside of the Challenges, send a mail explaining this to the host.  If you explain how you've earned a certain trophy, such as coder for making code edits to your page and learning some coding, or designer for designing graphics for your page or for others, or illustrator for drawing something for a RE:CREATION character, then the host will review your content and award your trophy via your score chart. If you're SURE you earned one, then just take it, YOLO, but let the host know to update the chart.
</p><p>
You will be able to display your trophies on your character's petpage, your userlookup, your portfolio, or where you see fit! They have transparent backgrounds and can be resized as needed. The codes below shrink the trophies and link back to RE:CREATION.

Whatever form your adoptable takes, make sure it's something you can easily edit. If it was created in a program with layer options, keep the base lineart and base colors seperate so you can easily change the colors later!

Although the following is not required, if you feel like doing so, then you may use your base image to create premades of that species in blue, red, green, yellow, faerie, and so on. You can choose to open to custom adopts exchanges using your adoptable. When you post adoptables you made that are intended for pickup by others, such as free to use premade adopts, be sure to include a coded textarea box with each image that includes both the img src and the a html link back to your petpage. Visitors to your page will be able to copy this code and use your adoptables with credit on their own pages! If you don't want people to take your personal or custom adopts, disclaim that they're not available and to not take ones not intended for free use.

If you don't receive a response, you may move up the participants list until you have material to work with. Create fanart for that character. This can take the form of a drawing, painting, adoptable, poem, lyrics, music score, mosaic, sculpture, quilt, wood etch, baked goods, recipe, yarn plush, or whatever other art medium you want to work in. Your fanart can directly depict the character, or just follow the aesthetic or mood information the participant described for the character. Be creative! Have fun creating! Don't forget to finish it by the event deadline! If you are using a photograph of a crafted artpiece, ensure no human faces or other personal information is captured. Follow TNT guidelines. Post the fanart you created for others in a section seperate from your Fanart Gallery on your page for judges to review. Post the fanart you receive from others in your Fanart Gallery section, and be sure to kindly and graciously thank the creator for the art.

<h1>inspiration</h1>
<p> RE:CREATION was inspired by the original character creation workshop event many years ago, called CREATION, run by Lore. In 2019, after a long hiatus, Lore was thrilled to approve the reincarnation of CREATION by Eskay, and happy to have been the inspiration. The finely crafted bones of RE:CREATION prepared by Eskay excited all the participants who signed up that summer, and challenges began that August. However, life circümstances began to spiral for Eskay, and the 2019 event fell through mid way. In May 2020, with renewed energy and creativity, Eskay returned determined to redo the event, and do it properly, with powerful ideas to inspire participants all the more, and everything set up to go. A devastating personal loss for Eskay ended this rebirth. In its wake, a third reincarnation of RE:CREATION grew when Nobody took over as host, with Eskay approving that the event would be in good hands. Nobody revamped the challenges and now hopes to keep the project and the dreams of Lore and Eskay going. Hopefully many more characters and much joy will be gained in future years of RE:CREATION.</p>

<h1>host messages</h1>

<p><b>Eskay Quote, AUG 2019:</b>: I want to thank the original event, CreAtion for the inspiration for this! I also want to thank everyone that has helped me along the way with making and keeping track of boards, with helping me with points, and by just being you. If not for all the kind words of encouragement, I wouldn't have been able to host this event. Without you all, I don't know if I would have had the strength to do this all on my own. You are my guiding lights and I am beyond grateful! You all are amazing, and your characters are simply stunning.</p>
<p><b>Eskay Quote, JUL 2020:</b>: Not that long ago, many of you rose up to help me when I was at my lowest. I felt like I couldn't breathe and that life was pointless. Thanks to you, PC, I am still standing here today. I want you all to remember we are so imperfectly human. Each of us are fighting wars within ourselves and your actions and words can be what can turn the tides. I ask that you be kind. Lead with an open heart. Be there for eachother, even for strangers. We are given such a short time here; don't waste it.</p>
<p><b>Nobody Quote, JUL 2020:</b> I've been excited about RE:CREATION since its first attempt in 2019. Eskay asked for help keeping it together then, I offered to step in, but the pain of my own personal losses interfered at the same time, and I couldn't keep it going. So when Eskay returned in 2020 to revamp it and asked for a cohost, I was eager to redeem what I felt was a personal failure in not being able to help the last time with this event that is so close to my heart due to years of teaching art and promoting creative pursuits. Though I am taking over for now, I keep thinking of how this would never have been possible without Eskay, and hope to make this event something that will continue for years on. I hope that this event, too, will inspire everyone, regardless of whether they do consider themselves artists, to take time to create. The truth is that we are all creators.</p>
