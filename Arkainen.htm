The gang's all here! Look at that spread. Most of them look like they're part of the background, but Fyora and Landelbrot look like they'll be clickable soon for something. Like a cutscene. Or... a Void Essence Collecting activity? You can probably guess which one will serve which. Coming later today! Watch this space!

</li></ul><br><b>25th June, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>World Leader Con is really looking packed in <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/story/?ch=1&amp;pg=5">Page 5</a> of <b>A Riot of Colour</b>! Where we maybe learn some things about who represents what.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9i9qbLj.png" width="450" alt="A Riot of Colour, Page 5" title="A Riot of Colour, Page 5"><br><br>

We got <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/mansion.phtml">Governor McGill</a> and the <a href="//www.neopets.com/magma/townhall.phtml">Mayor of Moltara</a> having a chat, the mayor looks a little more worried than McGill does. Meanwhile, <a href="//www.neopets.com/prehistoric/townhall.phtml">Grand Elder Kyruggi</a> and Chief Honcho are dazzled by the high-tech wonders of Commander Valka. You might not know a few of these people. Valka is the Commander of the Resistance, victors of the <a href="//www.neopets.com/space/ros/comic.phtml">Return of Dr. Sloth</a>. 

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ybb3WRW.png" alt="Valka laying plans for the Empire after his rebels overthrow it." title="Valka laying plans for the Empire after his rebels overthrow it."></center>


<br><br>


Chief Adler Honcho? He's a head honcho over on <a href="//www.neopets.com/talesofdacardia/">Tales of Dacardia.</a> Originally "Island Builders" because "Dacardia Rezoned" didn't really grab people. He's the Eyrie to the left of this picture.

A third of the Altador Council are gathered at the round table. <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/archives.phtml?archivist=1&amp;examine_book=1&amp;view_page=17">Florin</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/archives.phtml?archivist=1&amp;examine_book=1&amp;view_page=41">Fauna</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/archives.phtml?archivist=1&amp;examine_book=1&amp;view_page=29">Torakor</a>... even <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/archives.phtml?archivist=1&amp;examine_book=1&amp;view_page=25">Marak</a> came over from coast guard. Meanwhile, at what appears to be the <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/archives.phtml">Archives</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/archives.phtml?archivist=1&amp;examine_book=1&amp;view_page=44">Jerdana</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/space/coincidence.phtml">Dr. Landelbrot</a> pore over what is probably research. In the background, <a href="//www.neopets.com/hero/showhero.phtml?hero=3">Fyora</a> consoles Orion over something. Probably how he appears to have broken his glasses again? Let's get a closer look.

<br><br>

Your reward this time around, a Council of Leaders Stamp. Good for the "Other V" page.

What a roster! We didn't get that cutscene today, probably so we could wait for these dignitaries to show up. But the original FAQ said that Void Essence Collection starts on June 27th! We still have every reason to believe that's happening! So maybe on the 27th we get both the cutscene AND the activity?

<br><br>

So let's look at who we've got. Valka's here, he's probably the Virtupets rep. Does that mean the Resistance now governs the Space Station? Wow, that would make them the only known government that invaded another "country," captured it, and held onto it. We've had many invasions, but the Resistance is the only invasion that stayed invasive. We've also got Honcho, does that mean Jewel was able to connect Tales of Dacardia to <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/">The Void Within</a>? 

<br><br>

Now let's look at who we don't got. There's no representative for Neovia. Does that mean they still don't have a mayor? On the other hand, we still don't see that Shenkuu rep. And we know from the Ships on the Altador Coast Painting that Shenkuu did send somebody. So maybe just because we don't see them in this comic that doesn't mean they won't be present? Hagan, Baelia and Tavi were all in the cutscene, or the original draft at least. They aren't in a comic yet, so does everyone need a comic? Or... maybe we're getting a third comic on the 27th with even more dignitaries? Would that push Void Essence Collecting back further? Could we... get a comic, a cutscene, AND the Void Essence Collecting activity on the 27th?

<br><br>

Tension is running high, people want a piece of this pie before it gets cold. Fingers crossed that Void Essence Collecting starts soon. June 27th! Let the next time we update be the day we start collecting Essence.</li>

<br><br><li><b>SMALL BUT INTRIGUING UPDATE?</b> It's not time to collect Essence just yet. But something just came across our desk from <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=smudgeoffudge">SmudgeOfFudge</a>. She's found another searchable item hanging out on the backend.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VrlFjZk.png" width="450" alt="Nyxs Snowglobe Found on the shop wizard. I'll see what else I can find." title="Nyxs Snowglobe Found on the shop wizard. I'll see what else I can find."><br><br>

Nyxs Snowglobe. We don't have an image for it yet. Maybe a soon to be released comic prize? Suggesting that Nyx is about to make her appearance soon?

<br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=neoryuuko">NeoRyuuko</a> has also been digging. <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tdmbgpop.phtml">The Discarded Magical GREY Grundo Plushie of Prosperity</a> is giving out four new prizes as of today: The Discarded Grey Yurble Plushie, the Discarded Vira Plushie, the Discarded Faerie Artificer Plushie, and the Grey TDMBGPOP Plushie.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/plush_disgyurb.gif" alt="Discarded Grey Yurble Plushie" title="Discarded Grey Yurble Plushie"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/plush_disvira.gif" alt="Discarded Vira Plushie" title="Discarded Vira Plushie"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/plush_dfariea.gif" alt="Discarded Faerie Artificer Plushie" title="Discarded Faerie Artificer Plushie"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/plush_gtdmbgpop.gif" alt="Grey TDMBGPOP Plushie" title="Grey TDMBGPOP Plushie"></center>

<br><br>

But hold the phone, let's get a closer look at that Faerie Artificer. Are those horns on her head? Like we know our faerie villain to have?

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2pG7GHN.png" width="450" alt="Only 3 known faeries with horns, and they're almost certainly all her." title="Only 3 known faeries with horns, and they're almost certainly all her."><br><br>

So surely this has to be our trio. Vira, this artificer, and the Mysterious Yurble. Is there anything we can learn from maybe checking the descriptions? The description on the Yurble plushie...

<br><br><center><b>This plushie is giving no joy...</b></center>

<br><br>

Doesn't really tell us much. How about the Vira plushie?

<br><br><center><b>Who could love this twisted and gloomy plushie…?</b></center>

<br><br>

Vira wants/wanted to be loved? We already knew that. How about the Artificer?

<br><br><center><b>An ancient timeworn plushie depicting a bygone office once held in the Faerie Queens Court. The position was done away with so long ago, that few who still walk Neopia today remember who last held the title..</b></center>

<br><br>

Oho, now that's something. Now we can speculate. What's an "artificer" anyway? It's a fancy word for "mechanic" or "craftsman" or "builder of stuff." You hear about them a lot in fantasy RPGs. Delina would be a good example of what an "artificer" would typically look like. But Delina is the Crafting Faerie, not the "Faerie Artificer." As the plushie says, barely anyone remembers when last Faerieland had a Faerie Artificer.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/shh/event/crafting-faerie-1.png" alt="On the other hand, can you remember when last you had a Crafting Faerie Quest?" title="On the other hand, can you remember when last you had a Crafting Faerie Quest?"></center>

<br><br>

So what did the Artificer make in her time? Well, remember during <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tfr/">The Faeries' Ruin</a> where they introduced the existence of these faerie artefects that Brynn and Hanso were put to the task of securing? So that they didn't fall into the wrong hands? Maybe she made those? Because in Brynn's <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=279">Neopedia</a> article, she's quoted as saying <b>Most faerie artefacts are relics from long ago, when Neopia was a very different place. They don't belong here now.</b> This lines up nicely with the Faerie Artificer position being discontinued. Times changed and we didn't need these artefacts anymore. So we didn't need a Faerie Artificer anymore. Our faerie villain is probably at least mad about losing her job. But here's a question: Why did we ever need faerie artefacts? What sort of place was Very Ancient Neopia that faerie artefacts were called for? And what changed to make them not called for? Maybe we'll get the chance to ask this faerie villain about it?

<br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=yerimiese">Yerimiese</a> has a theory. What if the Paint Brush, the one the Painter is using, the one at the center of this plot, is an old artefact she made? And it was so dangerous that they had to abolish the office? We know the Paint Brush is hers, we just need to know when she made it. <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=kh2riku_3">KH2Riku_3</a> theorizes that our faerie villain also made Orion's lyre. And the reason Fyora doesn't recognize it is because it's new work from the Artificer that she doesn't recognize. Because she's never seen it before. Because being the Faerie Artificer means you have specialized knowledge of these artefacts. Because you're inventing them. Fyora can't know about a field she doesn't work in. Smudge takes this further, theorizing that our faerie villain also created the mirrors that Vira hands out, as mentioned in her <a href="//www.neopets.com/evil/showcreature.phtml?villain=13">Gallery of Evil</a> entry. If our faerie villain is also the person who made Vira, surely she also made Vira's new stuff? Also remember, Vira has horns and the Artificer has horns. So if the faerie villain is the Artificer (and she almost certainly is), maybe she made Vira in her own image? 

<br><br>

Or maybe the Artificer didn't originally have horns. Smudge also asks us to consider that maybe she gave herself horns, and then gave Vira horns. Maybe she resents what happened to her and is blaming everyone but herself. Or maybe it wasn't her fault. Maybe her horns were given to her in an accident, thanks to the inherent risk of being a Faerie Artificer. Maybe all that exposure to artefacts is what transformed the Artificer, and now she resents Fyora and Faerieland for what they did to her? If Xandra is involved in this, and we needed some way for her to willingly work with a faerie, this would be great cause for it. A faerie who understands the failings of the crown and wants to fight back.

<br><br>

One last thing before we go: For a few hours tonight, the maps of <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/index.phtml">Meridell</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/index.phtml">Altador</a> had disappeared. Shortly before 3PM today, <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=kaitie_elizabeth1014">Kaitie_Elizabeth1014</a> was headed out to Altador when she <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=163268567">noticed the map wasn't loading.</a>

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4IW02RP.png" width="450" alt="Is Altador not loading for anyone else? If so maybe they're updating it for the 27th? The Void headquarters is in the Hall of Heroes, and the sky outside is way more dystopian than the current Altador." title="Is Altador not loading for anyone else? If so maybe they're updating it for the 27th? The Void headquarters is in the Hall of Heroes, and the sky outside is way more dystopian than the current Altador."><br><br>

Somewhere between 5PM and 5:46 PM, the maps started loading again. This is a common sign that Neostaff is fiddling with something. With the 27th approaching, this could be prep for Void Essence Collecting. And with essence, comes answers. And probably more questions.

</li></ul><br><b>23rd June, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>Every other day! Like clockwork, so far. <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/story/?ch=1&amp;pg=4">Page 4</a> of <b>A Riot of Colour</b> has arrived. And with it? All the people in that letter that Altador and Fyora sent.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kTKeNBU.png" width="450" alt="A Riot of Colour, Page 4" title="A Riot of Colour, Page 4"><br><br>

Brutal. Blackwing has to be carried like a baby by Aisheena. Blackwing is the Wocky, Aisheena is the Aisha, and Judge Hog is the Moehog, in case you didn't know.

<br><br><center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/t_74.gif" width="120" alt="Aisheena" title="Aisheena"><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/t_45.gif" width="120" alt="Judge Hog" title="Judge Hog"><img src="//images.neopets.com/new_shopkeepers/t_104.gif" width="120" alt="Blackwing" title="Blackwing"></center>

<br><br>

But did Neopia Central not have an actual governing authority to send? Or did they opt to let the Defenders go alone, staying back in Central to keep the fires going? Or how about this, what if the Defenders ARE the governing authority? Which do you think it is? Maybe some fourth thing? Let us know in <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=163262863">this thread</a>.

<br><br>

It looks like that "Nice King, Mean King" dynamic between Lord Darigan and King Roo is well underway! King Roo must've realized that Lord Darigan needs a friend, that Darigan Citadel needs a friend. After they both got snubbed by the <a href="//www.neopets.com/desert/diplomacy.phtml">Desert Diplomacy</a> trade talks, it's a matter of economic solvency for at least one of their nations. And just out of frame, there's Fyora and Altador watching the ships come in. So that confirms that, Fyora is actually present at the meeting. Will she say anything, or will she just listen for the most part? And if she's here, Orion must be nearby, right? He's been on the case since last year. A truly, truly packed house. The Yurble Janitor will not be happy with all the dirt this crowd is tracking through his Hall. <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=neofakeneo">Neofakeneo</a> would like to see the Janitor face off against the summit of nations, and he might get his wish. Especially if the Yurble Janitor is the Painter?

<br><br>

Let's have a look at our prize, the Ships on the Altador Coast Painting...

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dExKLFn.png" width="450" alt="Comic Prize - Your dedication is admirable. Here is a gift for your efforts! - Ships on the Altador Coast Painting - This item has been added to your inventory." title="Comic Prize - Your dedication is admirable. Here is a gift for your efforts! - Ships on the Altador Coast Painting - This item has been added to your inventory."><br><br>

Dignitaries and Defenders from far and wide. But if we zoom in (there's a bit more zooming in with this plot than usual) we see a Shenkuu ship or boat or whatever you wanna call it to the left.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/C8VklW1.png" alt="The dignitary from Shenkuu, depicted." title="The dignitary from Shenkuu, depicted."></center>

<br><br>

So Shenkuu sent somebody, right? Like Fyora, we didn't hear from any Shenkuu emperors or princesses. Will we? Once again we wonder if maybe that prematurely revealed cutscene at the roundtable will look different at all when we get it for real. Maybe more lines for Fyora, maybe more lines for whoever came over from Shenkuu. But on the other hand? This is a really packed house. Maybe not everybody gets to talk in the first cutscene. Doesn't mean that they won't ever get to, doesn't mean they don't have any contributions to the team. But like in any congress, not everyone has the floor at the same time.

<br><br>

Not only do we get another prize shop point for this, but the "From the Very Beginning" <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/rewards/">Fearless Deed</a> is now marked as complete! It was under control all along. 

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sf0gJgo.png" width="450" alt="One sixth of the way there." title="One sixth of the way there."><br><br>

The virtue of patience shown. If things aren't clear to you, just wait and do what you can, and they'll make sense in time. So surely this silent call to adventure they're talking about will make sense in time?

<br><br>

The Fearless Deed is good for a whopping TEN bonus points in the prize shop! Look at all those prizes we can afford now!

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8ewvuVw.png" width="450" alt="14 Fading Bottled Grey Faeries, please!" title="14 Fading Bottled Grey Faeries, please!"><br><br>

And with Fearless Deeds considered "extra" as far as full completion standards, who knows how many prize shop points we can get in the end? Maybe 60,000 is only the maximum for those who don't do Fearless Deeds. Maybe the sky's the limit for those of us who complete literally everything.

<br><br>

So let's see... dignitaries arrive on the 23rd... maybe on the 25th we get that cutscene? And then, on the 27th, we can finally go Void Essence Collecting. Just like the early FAQ said. Then we attend the Cup some time in July, and then at some point after that we should have at least 872 points which means we can buy 15 unique prizes. Yes, all seems to be going according to plan. But what then are the Acts? Originally we thought it was one Act for every week, but that theory is debunked. Maybe that's not for us to know right now, but the mind can't help but make guesses.


</li></ul><br><b>21st June, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>If you're a Neopian head of state, or if you visited <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/">The Void Within's Headquarters</a> this morning, you were surprised with a summons from Altador. It's about that rift in the sky. Yes, it looks like the rift is over the skies of all lands throughout the world. Every land with a sky, anyway.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qG4EHZF.png" width="350" alt="An urgent message to all of the Kings, Queens, Emperors, Lords, Governors, Mayors, Monarchs, Protectors and Defenders of Neopia.

<br><br>

This also counts as <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/story/?ch=1&amp;pg=3">Page/Part 3</a> of <b>A Riot of Colour</b>, and you get a prize shop point for it. Yep, it's been every other day so far. June 17th, June 19th, and now June 21st. So can we expect something on June 23rd? That's a Sunday, so... maybe June 24th? That would, however, put us in Week 2. And the question remains: What of the <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/rewards/">Fearless Deeds</a>? We're supposed to be able to complete everything in the first week, right? We'll know very soon.

<br><br>

Also coming soon? The cutscene with the summit of world leaders we've been waiting on. The one that leaked and was saved on <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=nguyeplm">Nguyeplm's</a> <a href="//www.neopets.com/~tropical_penguin">petpage</a>? But hold on, the summons mentions that King Altador AND Queen Fyora were organizing the meeting. We didn't hear from Fyora during the meeting. We don't necessarily need to, maybe she was just listening. Like Tavi was. But remember how when the dialogue dropped early there were reports of glitches and weirdness? Maybe Fyora actually was supposed to be part of the conversation but she didn't show up properly in the leaked, mislaunched cutscene. So it'll be important to see the cutscene as we were intended to see it. Who knows what'll be different? Maybe nothing. Maybe everything.

<br><br>

Receiving a message telling you to go to the Hall of Heroes, you probably actually went to the actual <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/hallofheroes.phtml">Hall of Heroes</a> page. Especially if you remembered that part of the FAQ that said cutscenes may need to be "unlocked" sometimes by first visiting somewhere specific in Neopia. But they didn't mean the actual page on Neopets.com. See, the plot hub is set at the Hall of Heroes. They don't come out and say it, but the architecture and interior decor looks the same.

The scene on the ground in Altador as the summit approaches should be pandemonium. This, on top of an <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/colosseum/">Altador Cup</a> with at least one new team? Be there.

<b>Meridell Greyed Out as a Rift Appears</b>

<br><br>

Meridell continues to contend with the Grey curse... and then a rift appears in the sky. <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/story/?ch=1&amp;pg=2">Let's dig in...</a>

Skarl awakes, like so many before him, to find himself struck by the Painter. A Draik knight, who is also Grey, attends him. Skarl then marches on Faerieland with his retinue and commandeers the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/rainbowfountain.phtml">Rainbow Fountain</a>. The Draik knight/Groom of the Rubber Mallard stands by, along with other Meridellians waiting their turn. Just out of frame we see Skarl spared no expense on Blue Paint Brushes. But it's like we've been told, nothing known works against this. Skarl scrubs in vain, the blue waters turn Grey but the Grey Skeith does not turn blue.

<br><br>

Oh, Skarl. If you're gonna try Paint Brushes, did you already try the <a href="//www.neopets.com/pool/index.phtml">Rainbow POOL</a> in Neopia Central? Stealing Orbs is one thing, but people gotta EARN those Fountain Dips!

<br><br>

But wait, do we misunderstand, or was a rift supposed to have opened up over the Meridell skies? And what about that call to adventure? It seems like, in small parts, the chapter synopses are not matching up with the comics. It might be that the comics are in flashback/prologue mode, meant to gradually set the stage for what's happening at the plot hub. But considering that we still don't have that cutscene at the roundtable, it sounds like the rift and the call and the cutscene are all things meant to happen later, and the hub is mistakenly showing us these things early. Like the <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/rewards/">Fearless Deeds</a> asking us to go Void Essence collecting. If it was a mistake to show us that dialogue, the flavor text and Fearless Deeds might be a mistake. Slight disconnect in communication between where the comics are and where the flavor text is. But these things should be cleared up in time, and we all should be on the same page. It's early goings, yet.</li>

<br><br><li>Speaking of that cutscene at the roundtable, very few were able to catch it in time. But <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=nguyeplm">Nguyeplm</a> was, and she managed to save the text to a <a href="//www.neopets.com/~tropical_penguin">petpage</a>. This conversation is clearly set after the comics. So maybe it did accidentally get released early?

<br><br>

Anything could change because of the premature launch, but the dialogue of the cutscene as it was originally leaked is as follows. Avatars are subject to change...

<br><br>

Ah, so the way they describe this rift, it sounds like the rift is not specifically over just Meridell. It's like the sun, it's over all of Neopia. It can be seen from everywhere, showering the world with its fizzling, otherworly substance. And after whenever this cutscene actually happens, presumably the hunt for Void Essence begins. Landelbrot prepares the "Void Essence container," and we the public will report for duty at the Hall of Heroes to contain said Void Essence. Time for us to be Heroes ourselves! But also? King Altador seems to be hinting at reaching out to ANOTHER entirely different team for the "colour conundrum." 

<br><br>

But the real conundrum is figuring out who did this and how. A conversation relevant to those wondering which of the <b>Tales of Neovia</b> villains might be involved. The team seems pretty sure Sloth and TDF are not involved. So that's a blow to the theory that anyone besides Vira was related to this thing. But perhaps the protest too much? How can they be sure? King Roo suggests that it's not like magic they've seen her use before. But who's to say she doesn't have new tricks in her bag? Her pseudo-Wraiths were such a new trick, we didn't even know it was her. "It's gotta be Wraiths" we said! And then it wasn't Wraiths, just something like Wraiths. And Mira says she hasn't seen Sloth out and about, but maybe one of his faithful is up to something? How about the Token itself? Where is that? Last we heard it was floating in deep space, but it could be in the Void by now. And then Sloth and TDF meet up and hatch something. But to truly know who's behind this, we must first understand the weapon they're using. And that's why we're collecting Void Essence and trying to understand the color conundrum. That's the first step. Learn what's happening to our world.

<br><br>

We start to see some dynamics between characters start to form. King Roo is pretty hands-on, this being his first plot. He's really making his voice heard. Makes sense considering the Grey is a threat to joy, it's probably something he takes very seriously. He also serves as a playful counterpoint to Lord Darigan's grim and militant style. Lord Darigan WOULD know about laying groundwork for an invasion. There appears to be a frosty dynamic between Amira and Nabile, the latter of whom showed real initiative, directing the business of the meeting at the top after King Altador. But it was Jerdana, hardest working woman in the city, who had the most lines. The "resident magic authority." Speaking of authority, Baelia tells us that she and Fyora have delegated the Library Faerie to check her records. How much rank does Baelia pull now? Has Fyora determined that Baelia needs to be closely involved with this because of the Greyness? Good for Baelia, in any case. But the theory on the faerie side of things is that the answer to what's going on might be kept in some ancient tome from a long-forgotten age of Neopian sorcery. But Jerdana will be working with Landelbrot, who thinks it might be aliens. Landelbrot is really coming into his own as the "mad scientist to the heroes." From the Bython discovery to now, he's become the man to see if Neopia needs weird science.

<br><br>

Most telling of all, though, is when Tavi said nothing. Just reflected. What was she thinking? Was it something Jerdana said? About whether or not the particles are harmful to Neopians? Does Tavi know something about the particles? Probably not, because surely Baelia would also know it and Baelia doesn't appear burdened with speechlessness over some thoughts in her head. But then AGAIN, maybe that has to do with her being a Grey Faerie, maybe... maybe... Tavi knows a little more about Baelia's past than she's letting on? Maybe it wasn't an accident that she found her on that mountain?

<br><br>

Speaking of those particles, let's listen to Landelbrot's theory. If he's paired up with Jerdana, he's probably on target. Scintilly has gone up to the rift and examined the gravitational waves coming from it. The rift  almost certainly leads to the Void (but our heroes don't know anything about that yet), and from what Landelbrot can tell the Void is total Wackyland. Even physics-wise things are backward in there. Now, they don't know anything about THE Void, have never heard of it, but they've come up with the name "void essence" for the purple energy that's raining from the sky. It hangs around for about a day, and disappears. So there ya go, there's your "Find the Void Essence" activity. Every day a new Void Essence to collect, and it's only around for a day. But why is it only around for a day? Because it's some otherworldy thing. Not meant to be in our dimension or whatever. Kinda makes you think about Bythons and that antimatter they emit, right? Another degree of connection to suggest that Bythons are involved in this somehow.

<br><br>

They don't know that there's a Void. But the way Landelbrot describes things that are of the Void, it sounds like an entirely alien dimension. Which begs the question, how did Nyx and her Faellie friend survive there, and will they survive being in Neopia now that they're essentially "of the Void?" Marked with the tentacle creature's essence? Recall that Nyx's name is "Nyx." Daughter of chaos. Wouldn't it be something if she really was the tentacle creature's daughter?

<br><br>

The minutes of that meeting: Nabile brings up how the Greyness has led up to Meridell turning Grey. Skarl is upset about being Grey, he has spared no expense to fight it. King Roo adds that a rift has appeared in Neopia's sky, Lord Darigan's expert insights say that someone is prepping for an invasion. It's how he would do it if he was invading. Between Sloth and TDF, the team is pretty sure neither of them are behind this. Amira might think maybe Nabile is behind it? But if we don't know who's behind it, let's start with what "it" is and the "who" will follow. Jerdana and Dr. Landelbrot are on the case. While the faeries are investigating old magical texts, Landelbrot's theory is that this is some alien extradimensional thing. But in order to know for sure, they need some sample material to test. It fades fast, as if it were the antithesis to our world. Amira suggests we tag in the Neopian public to volunteer for the job. Neopians are known for their prowess at gathering handfuls of sand, they can probably gather Void Essence. After which maybe we can make weapons and games. As for the Greyness, King Altador has an idea for that that he hasn't revealed yet.

<br><br>

And Tavi? She held her tongue. What was she thinking about? What is Altador's plan for Skarl's Greyness? What conclusions can be made from Jerdana and Dr. Landelbrot's tests? And... did any other nations send delegates to the meeting? So many questions and this cutscene hasn't even actually happened yet. Can't happen soon enough.</li>

<br><br><li>Speaking of the "colour conundrum," are you noticing things like how Skarl is Grey, but his crown is not? <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=alioldman">AliOldman</a> has. Something he first noticed when he saw how the Painter was able to paint Tormund himself Grey, but not his sword and shield over by the wall.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FQvAwiR.png" width="450" alt="Gotta be tougher than that to dull Altadorian gold." title="Gotta be tougher than that to dull Altadorian gold."><br><br>

The Painter is almost certainly not going up to each victim individually and painting them. So how does it work? The fact that it only Greyed Tormund but not other things in the room suggests that the Paint Brush casts some kind of aura that latches onto a target. The "self" being targeted. When we talk about phrases like "the Void within," is this that Void in action? Are Meridellians Grey because of some Void that Paint Brush has imparted unto them? And the land? 

<br><br>

Maybe as we get more cutscenes at Void Headquarters, they'll get down to figuring that out. Might take some vulnerability on Skarl's part. Some honesty about how he's feeling. But in reality they haven't actually begun yet. Fortunately, now that we know that comic pages aren't subject to the "updated once a week" stipulation, we might not have long to wait. To that point, you might wanna check the hub more often than once a week. Maybe every day. Probably won't count against you if you don't check that often, but if comic pages are coming more than once a week, something new could happen any day. 

</li></ul><br><b>18th June, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>No, <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/rewards/">Fearless Deeds</a> has not been updated to reflect the fact that Void Essence Collecting hasn't started yet. But something was updated. Very late tonight, <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=kh2riku_3">KH2Riku_3</a> noticed that the map on the table at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/">plot hub</a> has changed. Faerieland, which at one point was in its pre-Ruin spot, is now in its post-Ruin spot. Here's the way it used to look...

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HJBpFC0.png" width="450" alt="Neopia, pre-Ruin" title="Neopia, pre-Ruin"><br><br>

And here's the way it looks now.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fk9ZYpf.png" width="450" alt="Neopia, post-Ruin" title="Neopia, post-Ruin"><br><br>

The changes are there, but again, they're hard to see. Let's zoom in...

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/essPIqX.png" width="450" alt="Neopia, pre-Ruin, zoomed in" title="Neopia, pre-Ruin, zoomed in"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UIuepqE.png" width="450" alt="Neopia, post-Ruin, zoomed in" title="Neopia, post-Ruin, zoomed in"><br><br>

You might wanna open those in two separate tabs, tab back and forth until the differences pop out at you. But not only has Faerieland now been put on the ground, but clouds are covering Lutari Island. Why make these changes? Why was there even a pre-Ruin map on the table anyway? Did somebody accidentally grab the wrong image? Or... does it mean something? Something to come later? Discussion is underway on <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=163252946">Board 58</a>. With that cutscene dialogue accidentally popping up, the pre-Ruin map of Neopia was probably an accident too. But when you think about the defaced Faerieland poster and how it shows two Faerielands? The pre-Ruin map very well might come into play later. In the Marvel comics, we call this an "incursion event."

This plot is projected to change the world, and Faerieland is once again in a high-risk spot. How might Faerieland be changed this time around? Back in the sky? Blotted out? Multiple Faerielands? Aside from <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieshope/">New Faerieland</a>, that is. Keep Faerieland in your mind moving forward. Old Faerieland, New Faerieland, Past Faerieland, Future Faerieland. Fate appears to hold something special in store for it.

We wanted so badly to report on this earlier. But it has been such a crazy day, the only responsible thing to do was wait to see how things resolve by the end of the day. Technical difficulties? Yes. But that's only part of the craziness. So much happened today. Where to even begin??? 

<br><br>

How about the new <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/">plot hub</a>? Reachable, like most site events, from the front page.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/PBxPLjX.png" width="450" alt="A feeling of disquiet settles over Neopia as strange occurrences culminate into a murky peril threatening to swallow the entire globe... a call to adventure silently rings out across the land, pleading for new heroes to rise to the challenge.

Will you answer?"><br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/"><img src="//images.neopets.com/plots/tvw/header/images/anchor.png" width="450" alt="The Void Within" title="The Void Within"></a>

<br><br><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8z7ywGK.png" width="450" alt="A meeting underway in Altador?" title="A meeting underway in Altador?"><br><br>

We'll start by exploring the hub so that we know what everything is.

<br><br>

Here on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/">Home</a> page we find ourselves somewhere in Altador, overlooking beautiful country. We know it's Altador because the name of the background image is <b>altador.png</b>. What this also tells us is that this background will very likely change over time. We'll probably move around. We already know from what <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop</a> said this would be a "global adventure" that would "take us to at least one place we haven't been before." But the fact that they named the background "Altador" (as opposed to "bg.png" or something like they do for the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faeriefestival/index.phtml">Faerie Festival</a> or <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a>) suggests the name is meant to differentiate itself from other background image names to come. 

<br><br>

But wait, why are we in Altador? Who set all this up? And what's that in the sky??? A rift??? Are the rifts happening now??? Is the Void spilling in??? And what is that map on the table for? Tracking the fiendish formations of the Void menace? Because if you look very closely, it's different from the Neopia we know in a key way: Faerieland is in the sky on this map. It's tough to see because is so small. Fortunately, this map is based off of the "Choose Your Team" maps from the <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/colosseum/">Altador Cup</a>. So if you line the two images up, you can tell what's what and that Faerieland is totally in the sky on this map.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cDc1abV.png" alt="The map as seen on the hub" title="The map as seen on the hub"></center>
<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/altador/altadorcup/2010/teams/map.jpg" width="450" alt="The map as seen when picking a team for the Cup" title="The map as seen when picking a team for the Cup"><br><br>

Something <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=aishamom">AishaMom</a> noticed, Meridell is actually Greyed out on this map. It's really hard to see, you gotta zoom in. Meridell has a circular Grey spot on it. At 2.5x magnification...

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TYdOJzD.png" alt="Territory ceded to the enemy" title="Territory ceded to the enemy"></center>

<br><br>

So this gathering must be made in the wake of the attack on Meridell. But why is this map going off of old borders? Considering the speculation that this plot might involve time travel, might we need this map to navigate a world from a time when Faerieland was in the sky? 

<br><br>

Maybe we should check the FAQ first. We can't link to it, but we can summarize the key points.

1. <b>There will be comics, dialogue-driven cutscenes, minigames, puzzles, battles, community challenges... and prizes.</b><br>
2. <b>If you can't/won't battle, you can put in work at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/hospital.phtml">Hospital</a> instead. This is probably what's going on with Nurse Glee and the (still missing) Gelert doctor.</b><br>
3. <b>Dialogue-driven cutscenes may need to be "unlocked" sometimes by first visiting somewhere specific in Neopia.</b><br>
4. <b>All of these things will be divided up into chapters. Each chapter lasts 3 weeks, and there will typically be new content of some kind appearing weekly.</b><br>
5. <b>Within the 3 weeks a chapter is running, you must complete all of that chapter's challenges to get full rewards. You can still complete these chapters after the fact, but you miss out on exclusive "full completion" rewards.</b><br>
6. <b>There are also special achievements/Fearless Deeds that give out even MORE prizes.</b><br>
7. <b>Fearless Deeds will also apparently be giving out exclusive trophies?</b><br>
8. <b>This is projected to last around a year, but no one really knows for certain!</b><br>
9. <b>If you're unsure of what (if anything) you missed, or what "step" you're supposed to be on, you can catch up with the story on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/story/">Story</a> tab and get a general sense for what's going on at present on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/">hub main page</a>.</b><br>
10. <b>Things are gonna get so heavy, storywise, that "trigger warnings" are warranted this time.</b>

<br><br>

Initially, one of those dialogue-driven cutscenes was briefly available for us today. At the table found at the hub. It was glitched, however, and it was taken down before many could even read it. It was broken anyway, the dialogue wasn't making any sense, apparently? But that stuff about "A call to adventure silently rings out across the land?" An explanation for why the map shows an airborne Faerieland? That was probably given in the cutscene. For now, we must be patient and wait for Neostaff to fix it.

<br><br>

For now, let's scroll down to the "Plot Timeline" section. Here's where we learn what's happening, and what has happened. All the events that have been leading up to now, as well the now that we find ourselves in.

Hold on, before we go any further... bring up that <b>Advent Calendar III</b> point again. <b>As the Aisha realizes her Faellie friend could only make one device and chose to save her instead of himself, she breaks down. Her emotions merge with the otherworldly essence flowing through her, and she accidentally tears open a hole back to Neopia. But where and when will she emerge?</b>Where and when?" As opposed to just "where?" Asking about "when" implies that Nyx might not just be going to a new place, but a new time. As speculated earlier, these might be portals to another time! Portals to the future in Brightvale! Just like Magon was trying to make! Suddenly that map of a pre-Ruin Neopia seems even more key to what needs to happen. We're not just going from spot to spot, we're exploring time AND relative dimensions in space!

<br><br>

But for the time being, let's focus on "here" and "now." The "Now in Neopia" subsection of the timeline saves you the hassle of scrolling through the timeline and tells you whatever the current "step" in the story is.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6GCs1ki.png" width="350" alt="Chapter 1 - A feeling of disquiet settles over Neopia as strange occurrences culminate into an assault on an entire land during the dead of night...

Meanwhile, new heroes receive a call for adventure!"></center>

<br><br>

You probably noticed buttons like "Wait, what's happening?" and "View Story." Which brings us to the next tab, <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/story/">Story</a>, and the first page of the first chapter of <b>The Void Within</b>.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/S0lRaub.png" width="450" alt="A feeling of disquiet settles over Neopia as strange occurrences culminate into an assault on an entire land during the dead of night... Meanwhile, new heroes receive a call for adventure!" title="A feeling of disquiet settles over Neopia as strange occurrences culminate into an assault on an entire land during the dead of night... Meanwhile, new heroes receive a call for adventure!"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SH3Po8r.png" width="450" alt="A Riot of Colour, Page 1" title="A Riot of Colour, Page 1"><br><br><b>Chapter 1: A Riot of Colour</b>. The first of a total of 21 chapters. So if each chapter is its own 3 week event, and there are 21 total chapters... this thing is slated to last for 63 weeks??? That's well over 10 months. Closer to 16 months. Maybe a chapter "beginning" doesn't necessarily mean another chapter "ends?" Maybe chapters can overlap or be concurrent? Like maybe Chapter 2 starts while Chapter 1's 3 week deadline hasn't come yet? 

<br><br>

Outside of Castle Meridell, we see that Paint Brush again. And presumably, the Painter. It seems we now know what that Paint Brush does, because in its wake we see Jeran, Lisha, and Tormund all fall to the Grey Curse. Jeran and Tormund both being Grey makes them hard to distinguish. So how do we know that's Tormund down there in the bottom right? Aside from the fact that there aren't many other Lupe knights it could be? Because he's writing a letter to Roberta.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FQvAwiR.png" width="450" alt="Grey ink doesn't show up well on parchment." title="Grey ink doesn't show up well on parchment."><br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=joyfulcabbage">JoyfulCabbage</a> was keen to note the heart in the signature... <img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/oh.gif"><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/29wqhgZ.png" width="450" alt="An application for Prince Consort?" title="An application for Prince Consort?"><br><br>

Why would he put that there? What does it mean when a knight sends you a heart via text? What have Tormund and Roberta been up to since their video game? 

<br><br>

We have a couple questions answered pretty certainly though: Who's turning everyone Grey? The Painter. They did it with the Paint Brush. That's what it does, it turns things Grey. And considering we saw a "Mysterious Yurble" around the <a href="//www.neopets.com/donations.phtml">Money Tree</a> once he turned Grey, it's really starting to look like the Mysterious Yurble, the one spreading the Grey Curse, and the Painter are all one Neopet. At this point, it's probably just as certain that they're the Third Friend too. This title, "A Riot of Colour," seems to be an ironic one so far. "A riot of colour" is a phrase you use to describe something very vibrant and colorful. Not a phrase one typically uses to describe shades of grey.

<br><br>

Reading this comic is itself a task of the plot. Make sure you click and/or over your cursor over each frame of the comic so that they light up! There's a Grey Paint Filter in it for your trouble.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/a0CMxnf.png" width="450" alt="Comic Prize - Your dedication is admirable. Here is a gift for your efforts! - Grey Paint Filter - This item has been added to your inventory." title="Comic Prize - Your dedication is admirable. Here is a gift for your efforts! - Grey Paint Filter - This item has been added to your inventory."><br><br>

And? A shiny new Participation trophy.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/plots/tvw/rewards/images/trophies/ekad1l7h89.gif" alt="Abyss Gazer" title="Abyss Gazer"></center>
<br><center><b>Abyss Gazer</b></center>

<br><br>
 
What else are we supposed to be doing right now? Probably nothing yet, there's stuff to be fixed first. But if there were things to do? The <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/rewards/">Rewards</a> tab serves as a good checklist. 

<br><br>

Here's our Fearless Deeds. 3 acts. There are 3 weeks to a chapter, so each act probably corresponds to each of the weeks in the chapter. 

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ulr9q26.png" width="450" alt="Known as Doing Your Part in the Obelisk War." title="Known as Doing Your Part in the Obelisk War."><br><br>

But hold on, how are we supposed to do any of this stuff? Gather 50 Void Essences? Where would we even find those? Well, we weren't able to get a screenshot because it was taken down very quickly, but in an early draft of the FAQ they explain that <b>The Void Essence Collection Activity will run from June 27th to the end of the plot!</b> It's not clear if that's even still true, but the original plan was to start gathering Void Essence a little later. So if we can't do that yet, we probably can't do any of these things yet. No one's found any "Seasonal Events" to attend, and no one has enough prize shop points to buy 15 unique prizes. 

<br><br>

But it is a little concerning, seeing that "Complete all there is to do before the first week ends" Deed. Because in order to complete that Deed, by next week we have to complete "all there is to do." Does that mean completing the other Deeds in this act? Because that's impossible right now. And if Void Essence Collection is still being saved for June 27th, it will not be possible at all this week. So what's supposed to happen with that Deed? What's gonna happen when the week is up? Like with the dialogue cutscene from earlier today, it really seems like this is a mistake that they're gonna go in and fix something or change something. But because this is a time sensitive thing, the clock is ticking to make some kind of move. They very well could be like "This act doesn't actually start until NEXT week" or something like that, but it's easy to worry that some... clerical error... could cost us this. But for now, all we can do is be patient. Wait for something to happen with this, wait for something to happen with that cutscene. Maybe it's not set for June 27th, maybe it'll happen some time this week and we'll have only a couple days to do it and that's why it's an impressive achievement. Maybe this is all on purpose and we're just making assumptions.

<br><br>

Further down we have the "Trophies" section. And there's our participation medal!

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sEsvxKO.png" width="450" alt="One down, 59,999 more to go!" title="One down, 59,999 more to go!"><br><br>

Looks like the maximum amount of points you can earn by the end of this might be 60,000. After which you get the top trophy. But what can you afford with 60,000 points? In a change of pace, they're showing us the prize shop at the beginning of the plot, as opposed to waiting until the end to balance scores and whatnot. Brace for looooooong picture.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZinPn8n.png" width="450" alt="You'd need 71,772 points to have one of everything." title="You'd need 71,772 points to have one of everything."><br><br>

Looks like we've earned one (1) point for reading that comic! Redeemable for a Voidberry Potion,  or a Fading Bottled Grey Faerie. The latter of which is a very old item that was, up until now, unreleased. Probably because one struggles to imagine what blessings a Grey Faerie can bestow. Other Fading Bottles can be mixed at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/cookingpot.phtml">Cooking Pot</a>, but Fading Bottled Grey Faerie bottles give nothing.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fcrxern.png" width="450" alt="What can we get for this?" title="What can we get for this?"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2fJvxpG.png" width="450" alt="Three Grey Faerie Bottles and a Cooking Pot gets you three Grey Faerie Bottles." title="Three Grey Faerie Bottles and a Cooking Pot gets you three Grey Faerie Bottles."><br><br>




Aren't they supposed to not have any magic? In fact, a lot of these items are ancient unreleased prizes. The Fuzztik, Neetle (and White Neetle), Wormo, and Triclopstar are all scrapped Petpet designs that are now getting their chance. Reasons to be Grey, Gloomy Grey Games, The Art of Crying, and All About Grey Faeries are all books that went through the same. The Grey Draik Plushie has been waiting a long time to be released, but an item that maybe waited even longer? The Space Code Stamp.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/stamp_space_code.gif" alt="Space Code Stamp" title="Space Code Stamp"></center>

<br><br>

Who or what are we even looking at? This is the host of a very VERY old Flash game called Codebreakers. Not really playable anymore, even with Ruffle. If his <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=56">Neopedia</a> article is still canon (and it probably isn't because it's since been replaced), his name is probably "Inigmah the Space Brain."

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qynNDpk.png" width="219" alt="Codebreakers menu" title="Codebreakers menu"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ijsJRPQ.png" width="219" alt="Playing Codebreakers" title="Playing Codebreakers"></center>

<br><br>

Gone, but not forgotten, the Codebreakers concept has since been reused by <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=536">Time Tunnel</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=1173">Clockwork Codebreaker</a>, and perhaps most immediately relevant, the <a href="//www.neopets.com/mip/mstcode.phtml">Mysterious Stone Temple puzzle step</a> in <a href="//www.neopets.com/mip/index.phtml">Journey to the Lost Isle</a>. We're having a plot right now, and the Codebreakers concept is a popular one. If ever there was a time for it to be used again? And let's also consider that plot prizes have always been reflective of the plot itself. If there's something in the prize shop, it's usually because something in the actual plot matched it. We see all this Grey stuff, that lines up with the themes of Greyness and the Grey "curse" (really just a cursed coat of paint) spreading. But if an Inigmah stamp is in the prize shop, does that mean the plot will feature Inigmah? If that is his real name? The prize shop features these alien Petpets, does that mean the plot will take us to distant alien realms? If Inigmah is in this plot, that on its own opens the door to a diverse cosmic setting for Neopia and its surrounding galaxy. Maybe we see Inigmah, maybe we see these Petpets, maybe we see a new world that they all share? The world they come from?

<br><br>

But if prize shops are a reflection of the story of the plot, what else do these... 83 prizes... hint at? Who or what else might make an appearance?

<br><br>

The Space Usuki, Space Usuki Bobblehead, Space Station Background, Space Krawk collectible card, the book "Space Station Schematics," the book "Space Fashions," the Virtupets Space Station Stamp, and the Ultimate Space Chronicles Set suggest that outer space will be a running theme. We've already been to space so there's that.

<br><br>

The Giant Space Fungus (TCG) might suggest we'll even see space fungi? Or their spores?

<br><br>

The book "The Space Ace" might suggest <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=204">Ace Zafara</a> will show up? Or maybe just more space themed stuff?

<br><br>

The book "Stuck in Space," well Nyx and her Faellie friend are themselves "stuck in space," so that reference is already justified.

<br><br>

The Untold Adventures of The Space Faerie Book, Smiling Space Faerie Coin, Space Faerie Token, and Space Faerie Token (TCG) might mean that Mira herself will make an appearance.

<br><br>

We already know that Fyora is on the case, but the Fyora Apple establishes it firmly.

<br><br>

Speaking of things we already know, Meridell has been Greyed and we've seen in the rift that Brightvale is next up soon. So we don't need the King Skarl Quiguki or Hagan the Wise (TCG) to know this plot will involve them.

<br><br>

The book "The Great King Altador" might mean that King Altador is involved. 

<br><br>

The Jerdana Usuki might suggest that not only will King Altador be featured, but Jerdana will too.

<br><br>

The Lord Darigan collectible card might suggest that Lord Darigan is involved, as well he should be if Kass is involved.

<br><br>

The Princess Amira Plushie and the book "My Life as Queen" might mean that Amira is involved.

<br><br>

The Nabile Stamp and the King Jazan Stamp probably mean Jazan and Nabile both will be showing up. 

<br><br>

With all these world leaders featured, this also probably means we're headed for some kind of summit of nations, a meeting of world leaders. In which case, the King Roo collectible card probably means King Roo is invited. And the King Kelpbeard Stamp probably means Kelpbeard will be showing up.

<br><br>

If we're going to have a summit of nations, maybe the Shenkuu Mansion Background means a Shenkuu dignitary will be showing up? Maybe the Emperor?

<br><br>

We already know Orion is headed for the Altador Cup so he can have one of his moments. But the Extra Loud Techo Fanatic Megaphone might mean that the Techo Fanatic himself falls into the crosshairs of the Void.

<br><br>

The Black, Blue, Grey, Rainbow, Woodland, Robot, and Mutant Petpet Paint Brushes might suggest that Petpets will be prominently featured?

<br><br>

The book "Conquer the Dark" and the Cover of Darkness Foreground probably allude to the dark forces we're going to face.

<br><br>

The Dr Landelbrot Plushie raises the possibility that Dr. Landelbrot will be tagged in at some point.

<br><br>

The Tavi Plushie probably means that Tavi is involved. And if Tavi is involved, surely Baelia must be involved. We had that journal entry, after all.

<br><br>

But perhaps most intriguing of all? The Darkest Faerie Collectible Charm could potentially, POTENTIALLY mean that The Darkest Faerie is involved. So, Vira is confirmed to be involved. Kass is functionally confirmed to be involved, and he's related to The Three. TDF is in the prize shop. It... wouldn't be "impossible," but for only some/half of the villains mentioned in <b>Tales of Neovia</b> to be involved, but not all? Again, it would be a noticeable snub. Vira and TDF have been directly mentioned in the same breath as plot content. The Three have... at least one associate that's been mentioned in the same breath as plot content. Shadow Usul would certainly fit the setting? Plus, there's that <b>Our gazes met, and I stared into the void</b> line. The <b>This was pure nothing</b> line. Sloth's story used the word "void" too. Scarblade and Xandra... their ties are admittedly tenuous. And Neopian mysteries are known for their red herrings so maybe Vira is the only one of these villains related to this plot. But if these entries are meant to be red herrings, if nothing else that means we were meant to think that all of these villains might be involved. We were "led" to the idea.

<br><br>

Not sure what the Breathtaking Night Sky background might allude to, maybe just there as a reference to what a sky full of Void looks like?

<br><br>

Wrapping up our tour of the plot hub... the <b>Battle</b> and <b>Solutions</b> tabs aren't available yet. 

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/WSnuMQq.png" width="450" alt="Soon..." title="Soon..."><br><br>

The <b>Solutions</b> tab will probably be accessible some time after the puzzles and minigames and whatnot are released and we run out of time to solve them on our own. The <b>Battle</b> tab, well, that's almost certainly for when there's an enemy force to fight. The <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=58">Board</a> tab just leads to Board 58, and the <a href="//www.neopets.com/mall/shop.phtml">NC Mall</a> tab leads straight to the NC Mall. There's a small <b>The Void Within</b> Dyeworks thing goin' on right now, and Void-themed wearables like the Void Ruffle Skirt Outfit and the Void Wings are also on sale.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_clo_voidskirtoutfit.gif" alt="Void Ruffle Skirt Outfit" title="Void Ruffle Skirt Outfit"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_acc_voidwings.gif" alt="Void Wings" title="Void Wings"></center>
<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/tvw-nc.jpg" width="450" alt="Mini Void Dyeworks Update" title="Mini Void Dyeworks Update"><br><br>

But if you're not interested in what the Mall's offering, the takeaway from today's tour should be <b>Check the <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/">plot hub</a> every day, wait for something to happen/for Neostaff to untangle those wires, and when things DO become available to complete, ideally you wanna complete everything within the week if you want "Fearless Deed" levels of completion. Complete it within 3 weeks for "regular" full completion with no extras. And don't skip any story.</b></li>

<br><br><li>You probably already knew this because discussion was underway before the plot hub even went up, but <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/index.phtml">Meridell</a> really has been Greyed.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KKuYocy.png" width="450" alt="More like MeriDULL!" title="More like MeriDULL!"><br><br>

Well, most of it. <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/index_farm.phtml">Meri Acres</a> is still merry. But you know what's not merry? The <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/index_castle.phtml">castle</a>.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nMMRA2b.png" width="450" alt="More like casDULL!" title="More like casDULL!"><br><br>

For all this, as you probably suspected, it's finally time. <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/grumpyking.phtml">King Skarl</a> himself has FINALLY turned Grey!!!

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NWq89SV.png" width="450" alt="They really saved the best for last." title="They really saved the best for last."><br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=lorekeeperhannah">LorekeeperHannah</a> tried to make the newly Grey Skarl laugh, and she found that his dialogue has been changed in keeping with his new spirits. See, normally if you "get a chuckle" out of Skarl, he'll be like <b>*heh* That was a pretty good joke. I give it a 679 out of 1000. Here, have a little something from my kitchen. I hope you like it.</b> But when Skarl is Grey, he's all like...

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aXb8ivs.png" width="450" alt="Guess that wasn't too bad a joke. I'd probably give it a 679 out of 1000 if I wasn't feeling so gloomy. Guess you could take some scraps from my kitchen. I was finished with them anyway" title="Guess that wasn't too bad a joke. I'd probably give it a 679 out of 1000 if I wasn't feeling so gloomy. Guess you could take some scraps from my kitchen. I was finished with them anyway"><br><br>

And on the rare occasion that your joke has no effect on the Grumpy Old King, but he decides to throw you some pocket change anyway, Blue Skarl will say something like <b>Well, thanks for trying... I'll give you 58 Neopoints for the effort.</b> But Grey Skarl sees little value in what you or he puts forward.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mYrmEdL.png" width="450" alt="Well, thanks for nothing... I'll give you a pittance of 58 Neopoints for trying.." title="Well, thanks for nothing... I'll give you a pittance of 58 Neopoints for trying.."><br><br>

But if you should invoke his ire? Blue Skarl will say something like <b>That was the worst joke ever! I only give it 263 out of 1000! Leave my kingdom now! *Grrrrrrrr*</b> Can Grey Skarl muster the same fury?

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/f63ZLV5.png" width="450" alt="You call that a joke? The only joke I see around here is you. Why, I'd barely give that a 263 out of 1000! Begone, you humourless fopdoodle! *GUARDS!*" title="You call that a joke? The only joke I see around here is you. Why, I'd barely give that a 263 out of 1000! Begone, you humourless fopdoodle! *GUARDS!*"><br><br>

If any of you out there are able to make Skarl actually laugh? In hysterics? Let someone know, the results will be sure to fascinate.

<br><br>

So what happens after the Paint Brushes and the like don't work? Crown AND country were attacked! Skarl will be scrambling the knights now, right? Ah, but his best dudes are all Grey! And that's the beauty of the Grey Curse. The "status effect" it has. How much fight has Meridell got in her if her army is weakened with Greyness? What can 'pets do against such reckless... anhedonia? If all those world leader themed prizes mean we're headed for some kind of "summit of nations," the next step after this is probably calling the meeting. But then, when does that "call to adventure" silently ring? Did they mean that literally? Because the Plot Timeline seems to suggest it's happening now. Guess we can only keep our ears to the ground for now?


</li>

<br><br><li>But wait! Even more happened today! In the <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2024-06-17">New Features</a> we got another defaced graffiti poster! What did we say were lands TDF would probably wanna cause trouble if she could? Altador, Meridell, Brightvale... and Faerieland. Probably the most attacked land in Neopia.

<p>
<b>Pining for a whimsical weekend? Why not unwind in charming Faerieland? Feel your worries melt away as you enter Queen Fyora's magical domain where verdant valleys, floating clouds, and shimmering waters paint the ethereal landscape.</b>
</p>
<center><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/faerieland-poster.png" width="300" border="0"></center>

<br><br>

Probably the first thing that stands out to you? This shadowy figure here. This has gotta be Vira's faerie mistress.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/N4Ct0m5.png" alt="A distinctly faerie-shaped silhouette" title="A distinctly faerie-shaped silhouette"></center>

<br><br>

A side by side with the Faerie Festival post-event teaser will show it. But you know what ELSE this looks like? Do you notice how a point was made to emphasize horns atop this shadowy faerie's head? There is no other faerie we've seen yet with horns like this except Drakara.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2pG7GHN.png" width="450" alt="They all gotta be the same faerie!" title="They all gotta be the same faerie!"><br><br>

Vira in the Haunted Woods poster, Drakara/the mysterious faerie now in the Faerieland poster, and the Mysterious Yurble in pretty much every poster. Except... this one??? Yes, you can scour every pixel on this poster but you won't find the Yurble. It's practically certain at this point, so let's presume the Mysterious Yurble is the Painter and the Third Friend. They were present for all of the attacks on lands up to this point, but not Faerieland. What happens to the Yurble by the time this crisis reaches Faerieland? What happens in general once this crisis reaches Faerieland? See, Faerieland is one of those "strategic targets." Any land being attacked is a crisis, but hitting a land like Faerieland, you save that for the master stroke of your evil plan. So what's gonna happen when Faerieland gets hit?

<br><br>

We see the usual, creeping shadows that blot things out...

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1djUnwh.png" width="450" alt="Book shop is closed..." title="Book shop is closed..."><br><br>

Positivity replaced with negativity...

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9rZt00A.png" width="450" alt="The enemy wants you sad." title="The enemy wants you sad."><br><br>

But what's unique to this poster? And the other thing that stood out to you? There's a tear in it. A "rift" one might even say... revealing a pre-Ruin Faerieland.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KjS58q3.png" width="450" alt="How many prize shop points for THAT???" title="How many prize shop points for THAT???"><br><br>

So we've got a pre-Ruin Faerieland on the map, a pre-Ruin Faerieland in the tear on this poster, AND the Plot Timeline raises the possibility that Nyx may have opened a rift or tear to a different time. What happens when Faerieland gets hit? Probably weird timey/spatial stuff! But why wouldn't the Mysterious Yurble be around for this? Does something happen to them by this point? Are they perhaps sacrificed to make this phase of the attack come true? Truly evil is no real friend to anyone. But maybe, just maybe, we can talk the Mysterious Yurble away from this before it's too late? Maybe we do, and this is why they aren't there? In any case, different periods of time for different places (particularly Faerieland) appear to be a factor. Could this maybe culminate in Faerieland being returned to the sky? We go back to the past and pull out a variant of Faerieland from another time and have that be our airborne Faerieland?

<br><br>

The <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/personality.phtml">Faerie Personality Quiz</a> crystal ball appears to have been replaced with some kind of trickling fountain. A rainbow fountain, maybe?

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/iUpBJBf.png" alt="The unmistakable trickling of faerie water from faerie clouds" title="The unmistakable trickling of faerie water from faerie clouds"></center>

<br><br>

Maybe it's the "ink" that this evil Paint Brush uses to turn things Grey? It might explain the meaning behind the word "BLOTOUT" at the top of this poster. It might also explain what the inky graffiti on all these posters is supposed to be.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZQSklNb.png" width="450" alt="Remember when bottling faeries was the worst Faerieland had to worry about?" title="Remember when bottling faeries was the worst Faerieland had to worry about?"><br><br>BLOTOUT." In case there was any remaining doubt that what's happening on these posters is the result of a Paint Brush. That does say BLOTOUT, right? <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=lizymarie_css">LizyMarie_CSS</a> points out that what looks like a "U" in "BLOTOUT" actually has a descender on it, making it look like a "Y." Spelling... "BLOTOYT?" Stylistic choice, or does it mean something?

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/PyHIAQA.png" alt="Kinda looks like it was written with a Paint Brush?" title="Kinda looks like it was written with a Paint Brush?"></center>

<br><br>

If it is "BLOTOYT," it likely would still have to be referencing the word "BLOTOUT" in some way. Like, it's "BLOTOUT" but with some hidden twist. But before we can understand that, we must understand what's meant by "BLOTOUT." Is the end goal, or perhaps an important spoil of this war, a "blotted out" Faerieland? This Grey paint or ink or whatever poured into Faerieland like a fountain, drowning it out, along with all its celestial rainbow magic? If we're talking about themes of color, Faerieland is known for its rainbow water. Neopia as a whole, really. Maybe Faerieland is where we get all of our rainbow water, and this faerie wants to blot Faerieland out for the domino effect that would have on the world? Rid Neopia of rainbow water and rule an empire of monochrome?

<br><br>

But if that is what's going on here, what might a Y snuck into the word mean? Maybe... it actually says "Blotoyt" and the plan is to conquer and rename Faerieland. Notice the poster crosses out the word "Faerielannd." So technically it doesn't say "Blotout Faerieland," because the word "Faerieland" is replaced entirely.

<br><br>

We have 7 posters now. Meridell, Brightvale, Neopia Central, Haunted Woods, "The Mountains," Altador... and now Faerieland.

<br><br><center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/meridell-poster.png" width="70" alt="Meridell besieged?" title="Meridell besieged?"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/brightvale-poster.png" width="70" alt="Brightvale besieged?" title="Brightvale besieged?"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/neopiacentral-poster.png" width="70" alt="Neopia Central besieged?" title="Neopia Central besieged?"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/hauntedwoods-poster.png" width="70" alt="Haunted Woods besieged?" title="Haunted Woods besieged?"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/mountains-poster.png" width="70" alt="Mysterious mountains besieged?" title="Mysterious mountains besieged?"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/altador-poster.png" width="70" alt="Altador besieged?" title="Altador besieged?"></center>
<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/faerieland-poster.png" width="450" alt="Faerieland blotted out?" title="Faerieland blotted out?"><br><br>

Today, Meridell as a whole was attacked. The first land to get a poster and the first land (as a whole) to be attacked. Does this mean the order of release was telling us the order in which these lands will be attacked? <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=lizymarie_css">LizyMarie_CSS</a> thinks so. Those creases in the Altador poster were not telling us "The attack starts here." The attack started in Meridell. Well, the mass Greying started in Meridell. But where are the evil eyes and the grasping hands? Does that part come later? Is Greyness just the first stage of the transformation this Paint Brush causes? 

<br><br>

Or... there's still the idea that the depictions on the poster have always been symbolic and not literal. Especially if the Mysterious Yurble on the posters is the Painter. Because we don't see the Painter holding a balloon, but we do see them holding a Paint Brush. The balloon might just be artistic symbolism for the Paint Brush. In fact, the shot of the Painter before Castle Meridell in the night? It kinda sorta resembles the staging for the Meridell poster, doesn't it?

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/r8DM46j.png" width="450" alt="Manga vs. anime" title="Manga vs. anime"><br><br>

So if these depictions are just symbols, we must now look at Meridell and what actually happened to it, and see where the symbols match up with reality. If balloon = Paint Brush, what about the evil eyes and grasping hands? A metaphor for the oppressive depression the Grey Curse brings about?</li>

<br><br><li>There's been a lot to take in, especially all in one day. But the things you should know today are that Meridell was turned Grey and the Painter did it. A new poster has been released, revealing what Faerieland will probably look like when it gets hit like Meridell did. But we also see a pre-Ruin and a post-Ruin Faerieland on the newest poster, implying that parallel points in time or alternate realities will be a factor. What should you do about it? Be ready for battle (or caretaking if you prefer the Hospital), and keep checking the hub and reading the comics as new ones come in. Plots take a few days before there's anything for you to actually do, but you should try to check in at least once a week. 

<br><br>

Why is the hub in Altador? What was that dialogue? Where is this "call to adventure" for "new heroes?" These are things we don't know yet. But we should have answers soon. If for no other reason than the fact that it's the first week of the plot, and the Fearless Deeds say we should be able to complete everything there is to do before the week is over. By this same time next week, you should be even busier than you were today. 

<br><br>

They've put up new colors all across social media. <a href="//www.neopets.com/tvw/">The Void Within</a> is THE thing across the Neopets brand for... at least 10 months. With 3 weeks to each chapter, maybe even longer. All hands are on deck for this. And before this is over, surely we all will be changed in some way by this. Neopia will not, cannot be the same.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/QBSQ0Wf.png" width="450" alt="The Void casts a long shadow." title="The Void casts a long shadow."></li></ul><br><b>16th June, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li><b>ONE DAY UNTIL SHOWTIME!!! THE VOID WITHIN BEGINS TOMORROW!!!</b>

<br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=heartstar8">Heartstar8</a> was at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/hospital.phtml">Hospital</a> when she noticed a change. Ordinarily you see that Gelert doctor there.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/shopkeepers/hospitaldoctor.gif" alt="The doctor is in." title="The doctor is in."></center>

<br><br>

But today, a change has been made.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NjuJk26.png" width="450" alt="The nurse practitioner is in, not sure about the doctor." title="The nurse practitioner is in, not sure about the doctor."><br><br>

The nurse you see at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=13">Pharmacy</a> can now be seen holding down the fort here as well. And she's got a name now! Nurse Glee. And couldn't we all use some Glee in these empty, Grey days?

<br><br>

But why is the doctor gone? Discussion is underway on <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=163246580">Board 58</a>. Maybe he's off treating some high profile, top secret case of Greyness? Some head of state, maybe? Like <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/grumpyking.phtml">Skarl</a>? Or whoever runs the government in Neopia Central? Or maybe the doctor has come down with Greyness himself? 

<br><br>

Here's a question: Why doesn't Nurse Glee tell us what happened to the doctor? Is that something we're meant to find out tomorrow? Could that be where Chapter 1 starts, at the Neopia Central hospital? Or maybe the first plot puzzle? As another one of those "nameless characters," he could use this plot and this plot could use him. Nurse Glee got a name, maybe it's time for him to get a name and some things to do. He beat Scourgies, maybe he can beat the Grey Plague.

</li></ul><br><b>14th June, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>3 days until showtime! It's <b>The Void Within Weekend</b> and we have another... small update to share. New <a href="//www.neopets.com/mall/stylingstudio/">NC Pet Styles</a> are on the way, now in Grey! We didn't think much of this at first. Yes, there's a Grey Curse going around, but is this really related to the curse?

<br><br>

The caption for this Facebook post suggests it very well may be...

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zgWUIb5.png" width="450" alt="A wave of adorable gloom is hitting the NC mall today as all-new Grey NC Pet Styles make their way into Umbra's studio! - While it seems like a much-deserved makeover, we wonder if it hints of something bigger brewing in Neopia?

We will know soon…</b> So have Umbra's styling colors been drained by whatever force is out there spreading the Greyness? 

<br><br>

Ever since <a href="//www.neopets.com/trudys_surprise.phtml">Trudy's Surprise</a> got hit, <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=yerimiese">Yerimiese</a> has been thinking that maybe it's not individual targets that have been getting hit with Greyness, but rather the color of Neopia itself is gradually draining away in bits. Imagine instead that there's some... colorful energy that unites us all in Neopia. A "Colorforce" if you will. Some energy integral to the world or universe as we know it. That's what's been targeted, as opposed to a handful of individuals. 

<br><br>

If the curse is as widespread as it is, it would be very hard for an individual to hit all these victims on their own. But at the same time, it's not contagious enough that Orion would turn Grey after hanging out with Kari. This thing is widespread, but for some reason it's not working like a virus would. Not following any observable "spreads from Patient A to Paint B" pattern. Not one we can observe, anyway.

<br><br>

When will we learn why the world is turning Grey? It could be months. During the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tfr/">Ruin</a> we didn't learn why the faeries were petrified until just about the end. During the <a href="//www.neopets.com/twr/">Resurgence</a> we didn't learn who was being the pseudo-Wraiths until just about the end. So when this thing starts, keep looking for answers but don't expect them to come right away.</li>

<br><br><li>Another reason to believe this Grey Curse will continue to spread well into <b>The Void Within</b>? We've got a little sneak peak into this year's remaining content schedule. Check the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=1010">Editorial</a> of Neopian Times #1010. <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=vintagecollectibles">VintageCollectibles</a> asks...

<br><br><b>Hi TNT! We are all excited for the upcoming plot and it sounds like there will be plenty to do during it (10 whole months!!!). Could we expect a Charity Corner type event during it? I'm sure it will help with cleaning up some pesky junk we've been building up and help reduce the price of some of the rarer restockables that continue to inflate like crazyyy.</b>

<br><br>

And <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=sunpotato">Sunpotato</a> responded...

<br><br><b><i>At the moment we don't have any Charity Corner type events planned for plot but we do plan on bringing back the recycling event we did for Faerie Festival back for this year!</i></b>

<br><br>

So, no "Charity Corner" style event, but they do have a recycling event, whatever that means. Suggesting that they aren't the same thing. But we will be recycling, which means there's going to be some kind of... waste or toxin or something in the world that needs to be cleaned out. Like it was last time. Does this mean the Earth and Water Faeries are still at risk of being weakened? Are they still doing that?

<br><br>

This, on top of battling bad guys and uncovering the secrets of the Void? We're gonna have a very busy 10 months ahead of us. So enjoy your last weekend of freedom for a while.

</li></ul><br><b>13th June, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>4 days until showtime!!! It's Thursgrey and like clockwork we've got our <a href="//www.neopets.com/trudys_surprise.phtml">latest victim</a>.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CEF6FPM.png" width="450" alt="Not entirely Grey, but the signs are definitely there." title="Not entirely Grey, but the signs are definitely there."><br><br>

Trudy's Surprise??? We were so sure it would be <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/grumpyking.phtml">Skarl</a>. Right time, wrong place. But it could still happen! Even if <b>The Void Within</b> starts while Skarl is still blue, it doesn't mean he can't turn Grey. Perhaps it is a mistake to thing of these Grey Curse cases strictly as "teasers" or "prologue" to the plot. Maybe it just keeps going until we find a cure.

<br><br>

Like with the <a href="//www.neopets.com/donations.phtml">Money Tree</a>, there are Grey prizes.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/toy_gtrudyslotmachine.gif" alt="Grey Mini Trudys Slot Machine" title="Grey Mini Trudys Slot Machine"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/gift_greycoins.gif" alt="Grey NP Coins" title="Grey NP Coins"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/gift_greygb.gif" alt="Grey Present" title="Grey Present"></center>

<br><br>

...Unlike with the Money Tree though, we don't see more of the "Mysterious Yurble." So if you were expecting a last minute confrontation with the Mysterious Yurble that then springboarded into Chapter 1 of the plot? That didn't happen. The Yurble has shaken our pursuit, it would seem. And the Grey Curse shows no change in its pace either. The simplest answer and perhaps the most likely? Chapter 1 starts where Orion's vision of Nyx ended. And then, a little later perhaps, maybe after the <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/colosseum/">Altador Cup</a> starts, we catch up with Orion for the next vision.

<br><br>

So if Chapter 1 starts with Nyx and, presumably, her escape from The Void, how does she get outta there? Through the rift she opened? Is that rift showing Brightvale an actual portal to Brightvale? And not just a "look" at Brightvale? Because if it's a portal, and Chapter 1 starts on June 17th, wouldn't that have to mean that on June 17th (when Chapter 1 is released), Brightvale will be under attack/a coat of paint? Courtesy of the mystery painter? Because that certainly hasn't happened yet. Or maybe that is Brightvale in the future, and Nyx is able to show visions of the future as well as portals to the present. And that's how she escapes. She makes a second portal that gets her out of there.

<br><br>

Or... maybe it's a portal to the future? Not just a vision of the future? Like Magon always wanted to make? Remember, Time Travel Negg potentially means that there'll be themes of time travel to contend with!</li>

This might be the last update before <b>The Void Within</b> actually starts. The final bit of prologue. We'll keep watching social media in case something relevant comes up there, but for now, let's reflect one last time on the questions the prologue has raised.

<br><br>

1. <b>What is this "Grey Curse" and how do we "break" it?</b><br>
2. <b>What does the poster graffiti actually mean? Why these bones and flowers? If a door gets blocked up, are you trapped inside?</b><br>
3. <b>Who is the Mysterious Yurble?</b><br>
4. <b>Who is the Painter?</b><br>
5. <b>What is the Paint Brush and what is it capable of?</b><br>
6. <b>Who is the "third friend?</b><br>
7. <b>Is there redemption for Vira?</b><br>
8. <b>Who is Vira's faerie mistress? Is it Drakara?</b><br>
9. <b>Who is Baelia's friend from the journal entry? Is it Tavi or someone else?</b><br>
10. <b>Is Baelia even involved?</b><br>
11. <b>Is Jennumara involved?</b><br>
12. <b>Where is Kass?</b><br>
13. <b>Are The Three doing anything?</b><br>
14. <b>Is The Darkest Faerie involved or was that just a random plug for the Puzzle Hunters Club?</b><br>
15. <b>What will the Puzzle Hunters Club be doing, plot-wise, after June 15th?</b><br>
16. <b>Are the other villains from Tales of Neovia involved?</b><br>
17. <b>What is the Lyre?</b><br>
18. <b>What is the music box cylinder?</b><br>
19. <b>How are Nyx and her Faellie friend gonna get home?</b><br>
20. <b>What's the Faellie's name, if not Zizi?</b><br>
21. <b>Could Kari become a full "fledged" Grey Faerie in time?</b><br>
22. <b>Will Skarl turn Grey?</b><br>
23. <b>Has Chadley/Smile Withme been affected by the Void's eldritch power or something?</b><br>
24. <b>Where will we go that we've never been before?</b><br>
25. <b>What is that tentacle creature?</b><br>
26. <b>What is The Void?</b>

They want your theories/headcanons, so share them now. Last minute bets before we see her in action on Monday? Suggesting that Chapter 1 will start with us learning a little more about Nyx and her Faellie friend? 

<br><br>

We see this casual, pre-Void looking alt of our heroes. An outfit we'll probably see more of on Monday. Maybe something they'd wear around the Space Station. Because that's where this is set, on the Space Station. So maybe one thing we can assume is that she lives up there? But she also called Brightvale her home. So what we're probably dealing with is a Brightvale resident who moved to the Space Station. Stuff we'll maybe get to see in a flashback or something? Get to learn about her past before we deal with her present? And then onto her future...

</li></ul><br><b>11th June, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>6 days until showtime! Not even a week left. <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=_hermes_32">_Hermes_32</a> was over on the Neopets Facebook page a couple hours ago, where found more delicious crumbs to appetize us.

Nyx looks like she's adjusting to her new powers. Surely this is after she's absolutely certain her Faellie friend is alright?

<br><br>

And we've got a logo finally! Look at that, it would look fabulous in any press kit.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lLZnh4Y.png" width="450" alt="TFR had the mirror, Obelisk War the Obelisk, and TVW the Paint Brush." title="TFR had the mirror, Obelisk War the Obelisk, and TVW the Paint Brush."><br><br>

There's that Paint Brush in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=58">Board 58</a> logo again. Now let's pull up that skull thing hanging off the edge of the Haunted Woods poster.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wSrtBCp.png" width="450" alt="Exhibit A versus Exhibit B" title="Exhibit A versus Exhibit B"><br><br>

Similar, but not identical. The Paint Brush has a handle, but whatever that is on the poster, below the skull is... something else, not a Paint Brush handle. Suggesting that whatever it is on the poster is not a Paint Brush, but definitely related to this Paint Brush. Still not clear if this is the only Paint Brush, or if we've seen multiple Paint Brushes teased.

<br><br>

The logo itself is all glitchy, like the Glitch Negg from the recent <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a> and the prizes inside it. Remember how neggs are usually reflective of the theme of the Festival? And this year's Festival was, essentially, "The Void Within themed?" And so we looked at each negg to see what sorts of themes we would see in the plot? This logo is now strengthens the theory that the neggs from this year's Festival will reflect the themes of the plot. So... does this mean time travel??? And what does the glitchiness mean? Is that because the Void itself is glitchy and trippy? Will Neopia start to trip and glitch? Do the defaced posters show what the trippy glitches would look like?

<br><br>

Maybe it's too limiting to ask "What's the theme of <b>The Void Within</b>? What's the aesthetic or setting or genre or whatever?" But if there's a general theme or vibe to a plot, it usually comes through in its logo. That's kinda the point of any logo; something summarized in a tidy little image. Or at least hinted at.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/pf9dkGP.png" alt="Plot logos from 2004 through 2006" title="Plot logos from 2004 through 2006"></center>

<br><br>

So what vibe does this give off to you? Maybe something cosmic and trippy? Something to think about for the next few days. 

</li></ul><br><b>8th June, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>9 days until showtime. In all honesty, we've gotten a little complacent when it comes to things like checking social media. With <b>The Void Within</b> so close, it's easy to believe the time for "teasers" and "previews" is over. Things to overthink the meaning of.

<br><br>

Yesterday we missed this post over on the Neopets Facebook page.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bBxsKcq.png" width="450" alt="The mysterious Grey Curse is spreading! What are we to do?! ..Well, we could.. pass the time with a game?

We see the Greying Altador again, but no graffiti this time. Instead we see this Grey Grundo and Grey Mynci, both doing their "angry" emote.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/pets/angry/grundo_grey_baby.gif" alt="Angry Grey Grundo" title="Angry Grey Grundo"><img src="//images.neopets.com/pets/angry/mynci_grey_baby.gif" alt="Angry Grey Mynci" title="Angry Grey Mynci"></center>

<br><br>

So what, if anything, might this mean? They chose Altador of all places, does this mean of all the Neopian lands marked for siege, Altador is of the most importance? At least in the immediate future? Is this fortune's way of telling us "Keep your eyes on Altador, something is about to happen there very soon?</li>

<br><br><li>Another thing we've been slacking on because June 17th draws near? Recognizing patterns. Patterns in when new Grey victims come out. What you may have noticed before we did is that every Thursday since the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a> ended, we've gotten a new Grey case.

<br><br><b>Thursday, May 9th:</b> <a href="//www.neopets.com/desert/shrine.phtml">Coltzan's Shrine</a>
<br><b>Thursday, May 16th:</b> <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tdmbgpop.phtml">TDMBGPOP</a>
<br><b>Thursday, May 23rd:</b> <a href="//www.neopets.com/prehistoric/omelette.phtml">Giant Omelette</a>
<br><b>Thursday, May 30th:</b> <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/knowledge.phtml">Wheel of Knowledge</a>
<br><b>Thursday, June 6th:</b> <a href="//www.neopets.com/donations.phtml">The Money Tree</a>
<br><b>Thursday, June 13th:</b> ???
<br><b>Monday, June 17th:</b> <b>The Void Within</b> begins

<br><br>

Almost too late to observing it too. It looks like we've got one more Grey case before the plot kicks off truly. Last Grey case ever? Maybe, maybe not. But this being the last one before the plot starts, it's probably gonna be a particularly notable case. Especially as we seem to be closing in on the one doing the Greying. This "Mysterious Yurble." Maybe on June 13th we'll actually get to see them in person, as opposed to scooting off after making a Money Tree donation. But who will be their prey? Well, we've been waiting on <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/grumpyking.phtml">Skarl</a> to turn Grey since April 26th. If a Grey Skarl is still part of Vira and her Voidly forces' plan, June 13th would be the time.

<br><br>

Potentially, POTENTIALLY, we might be heading into a Grey Skarl on the 13th, and then something happening in Altador when the plot finally starts. Or maybe the Altador thing happens before the 13th. Or maybe after the 13th but before the 17th. Maybe the 14th. Or maybe none of those things will be happening when we think they are. But if they are? Maybe it's just a coincidence of Altador and Meridell just happening to be important lands in Neopian history. But y'know who would hold a grudge with Altador and Meridell alike? The Darkest Faerie. We only think Vira's faerie mistress might be Drakara, for all we know that's TDF under the hood. On the other hand, whoever that is under the hood, TDF probably isn't the one who made Vira into what she is. The one hinted at in the Neopian Times Issue #584 <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=584">Editorial</a>. Vira predates the Darkest Faerie video game, suggesting that Vira was around and wicked looking while TDF was still underwater. This unprecedented dark force that made Vira, we're still keeping our eyes open for that.

<br><br>

Altador, Meridell, Brightvale, and Faerieland. These are places TDF would wanna cause trouble. You could argue that most of Neopia's villains probably wanna cause trouble in at least one of these places, but in either case we should keep watch in these spots. We will surely see the Mysterious Yurble there very soon.

</li></ul><br><b>6th June, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>11 days until showtime. Story coming in early this morning, the <a href="//www.neopets.com/donations.phtml">Money Tree</a> is the latest loss to the Grey Curse. Won't be long before the whole world is Grey.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jtxHtOx.png" width="450" alt="How it feels to never get anything but you keep reloading." title="How it feels to never get anything but you keep reloading."><br><br>

But get this, just like the <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/knowledge.phtml">Wheel of Knowledge</a>, new Grey prizes can be found here. Like this Grey Money Tree Plushie.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TMh3SUw.png" width="450" alt="Who could've dropped this?" title="Who could've dropped this?"><br><br>

Wait, "Donated by <b>Mysterious Yurble</b>???" <img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/oh.gif"> As in, THIS Mysterious Yurble???

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UEyXBSE.png" width="450" alt="Up there with Kass himself among Neopia's Most Wanted." title="Up there with Kass himself among Neopia's Most Wanted."><br><br>

So this Yurble is not "coming soon," this Yurble is out and about right now! And like Cinderella with her telltale slipper, they leave us a lead that maybe explains just where all this Greyness is coming from. But does Greyness follow them, or do they follow Greyness? And speaking of "following Greyness", is this just Stage One of a much more dreadful transformation? Because we've seen the Money Tree in the Neopia Central poster. All evil lookin'.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/drplZml.png" width="450" alt="Anger usually comes before depression." title="Anger usually comes before depression."><br><br>

If this look is in the Money Tree's future, and Greyness is in the Money Tree's present, does this mean Greyness leads to whatever this is???

We're up to 12 now, but <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/grumpyking.phtml">Skarl</a> very well might be coming along soon to make it 13. And if this Greyness is just the prologue to whatever freakiness we see in the posters? Well... let's just hope we can save the Greys before it comes to violence.

<br><br>

We've got a Mysterious Yurble on the loose right now. Right now. And it's starting to look like they're the one making people and things Grey. They might even be the one Nyx saw in Brightvale? Surely this plot must start with finding them.

</li></ul><br><b>3rd June, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>14 days until showtime. That is 2 weeks. One Times cycle.

<br><br>

So this is interesting, there's a <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=58">Neoboard</a> up for <b>The Void Within</b>.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bh6E3MH.png" width="450" alt="Not even at the top of the Neoboards." title="Not even at the top of the Neoboards."><br><br>

At the moment there are no posts on it, because you can't post on it. Yet. 

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/PgDAQF1.png" width="450" alt="Are we waiting for June 17th?" title="Are we waiting for June 17th?"><br><br>

If you're familiar with the Neoboards and <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=7">Board 7</a>, you'll know that Board 7 or "Site Events" has been the board for plots even before it had the official title of "Site Events." So... an intriguing move, if nothing else. Maybe even a little controversial, because so many have planted roots there. If we go there, will things be as cool over there as they are on Board 7? Or will they come down on you if conversation strays from plot discussion? If the chatgroups on Board 7 move over to Board... 58... will it be a smooth migration? But Neostaff knows all this, they made this choice with these feelings considered. Whatever happens next is on purpose.

<br><br>

Let's have a look at the icon they chose to represent the board.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/boardIcons/plot_tvw.png" alt="Universal symbol for The Void Within." title="Universal symbol for The Void Within."></center>

<br><br>

A Paint Brush. But maybe not just any Paint Brush. The horns, the skull? That looks like the Paint Brush seen in Brightvale, doesn't it?

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8dv9baY.png" alt="A third Paint Brush sighting???" title="A third Paint Brush sighting???"></center>

<br><br>

So is this how the Paint Brush really looks, free of any obfuscating shadows or darkness? If you thought the Paint Brush's natural state was a tannish-greenish color similar to Vira, and that's why Vira looks the way she does? If you thought maybe the Paint Brush and Vira's current form are linked and their similar color and aesthetic are the proof of that? Maybe reconsider.

<br><br>

Or? Maybe reconsider the theory that there's only one Paint Brush. Maybe the Paint Brush under glass and the Paint Brush in Brightvale are different Paint Brushes.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/smxfYfj.png" alt="Corporate wants you to spot the difference between these Paint Brushes." title="Corporate wants you to spot the difference between these Paint Brushes."></center>

<br><br>

Maybe there's more than one Paint Brush with skulls and horns. Remember that skull hanging out on the margins of the Haunted Woods poster? Maybe that's the origin of some common emblem that the forces of Void will be using against us. Maybe from... whatever this is... the Paint Brushes get their design. If this isn't itself a Paint Brush.

Dark faeries, tentacle creatures, skulls and horns, who's running this show? This and more will surely be discussed when Board 58 opens up. Some will be sad to see Board 7 supplanted, but it's probably for the best. One thing seems to be clear though: Paint Brushes are a running theme here. They're on flags, they're kept under glass, they're heavily focused on.</li>

<br><br><li><b>UPDATE:</b> <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=58">Board 58</a> has been taken away.

Maybe too early? Maybe they, like us thinking about the new Paint Brush, are reconsidering the idea at all? Overthinking, even? No easy answers in this day and age, patience remains the paramount virtue.

<br><br>

Maybe they should just keep Board 7's URL, but change the name and icon?</li>

<br><br><li><b>UPDATE AGAIN:</b> <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=58">Board 58</a> is back, baby. But it's been moved up to the top of the Neoboards list. As is tradition for plots.

Brightvale joins Neopia Central as the 2nd of only two lands to have a defaced poster and a Grey Curse victim. With the curse finally reaching Brightvale, does that mean what Nyx saw in the rift is what happens next?

With the plot starting soon, you start to think about how other plots started. And what precedent that sets for how this one might start. But then, most plots don't have as much prologue as this one has. But when they do, the plot proper usually starts with an investigation into what was going on during the prologue. <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tfr/">The Faeries' Ruin</a> started by looking into the petrification of the faeries. <a href="//www.neopets.com/prehistoric/outskirts/">The Obelisk War</a> started by looking into the emergence of the Obelisk. <a href="//www.neopets.com/twr/">The Wraith Resurgence</a> started by looking into the Faerie Festival attack. <b>The Void Within</b> has no shortage of mysterious things to look into. But the biggest, most public aspect of it? The Grey Curse. So maybe that's where it starts. We open with someone, or someones, looking into what to do about the Greyness going around? Maybe in Brightvale?

Wow. We didn't even mention that <b>Neopets LIVE - The Royal Edition</b> was today. We'd been burned on Lives in the past that weren't strictly plot related, we figured this wouldn't be news. The new Royal NC UCs had been released, surely this Live was going to focus only on that. 

<br><br>

As usual, we were wrong. We expected nothing, but got everything.

There's three dates you should probably know about. 

<br><br><b>Saturday, June 15th</b> the Puzzle Hunters Club will finally close the book on their secret avatar case. What that means for you is, you have until then to redeem the code <b>TIME4SOC14L1SING</b> at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/space/warehouse/prizecodes.phtml">Grundo Warehouse</a> to earn the avatar that we've been hunting for the past... since March 18th.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/ava_virtuallyalive.gif" alt="Virtually Alive" title="Virtually Alive"></center>

<br><br>

June 15th, the avatar retires that day. After such time, the Puzzle Hunters Club will be focusing on, as <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_fallie">Fallie</a> put it, "other things." To which she immediately added "WoooOOOooo~" so we can take "other things" to mean something intriguing and important. Plot stuff, surely, right? If you heard that you probably thought "Oh boy, so after June 15th we should keep an eye out on social media for more plot teasers." But if all goes according to plan, you'll get more than teasers after June 15th.

<br><br><b>Monday, June 17th</b>. That is the projected date for when <b>The Void Within</b> starts proper. No more prologue. It's on for real. That story again, for emphasis, from the words of our CEO Dominic...

<br><br><center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/themes/049_thelostheirloom_nov2018/events/warning.png"><b><font size="5">THE VOID WITHIN</font></b><img src="//images.neopets.com/themes/049_thelostheirloom_nov2018/events/warning.png"><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/themes/049_thelostheirloom_nov2018/events/warning.png"><b><font size="5">PROJECTED DATE:</font></b><img src="//images.neopets.com/themes/049_thelostheirloom_nov2018/events/warning.png"><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/themes/049_thelostheirloom_nov2018/events/warning.png"><b><font size="5">JUNE 17th, 2024</font></b><img src="//images.neopets.com/themes/049_thelostheirloom_nov2018/events/warning.png"></center>

<br><br>

2 years to the date since they announced the plot for the first time in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=962">Editorial</a> of Neopian Times #962. Dominic once said he didn't know about the plot, but he supposedly knows this much. But wait, Orion's planning on having another one of his fits at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/colosseum/">Altador Cup</a> this year, the speculation was that he was gonna bring us more plot prologue. So when is the Cup happening if the plot is happening in less than 3 weeks? We haven't had our grace period or Press Tour or signup time...

<br><br><b>The First Week of July</b> is when Dominic projects the Cup will start. They don't have a hard date for it like the other things, but they don't expect the Cup to start any earlier than July. So DESPITE what the so-called "safe money" would have you believe, <b>The Void Within</b> is actually starting BEFORE the Cup, the Cup will run concurrently. With <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_luna">Luna</a> clarifying that everything's interconnected. As it has been for a while now. So whatever vision Orion plans on having at the Cup? We'll already be plotting by the time he has it. So let's hope his warning doesn't come too late. If the plot starts before the Cup, does that mean Altador will be attacked while the Cup is happening?

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/altador-poster.png" width="450" alt="Results of the Games should probably be stricken from the record due to outside interference." title="Results of the Games should probably be stricken from the record due to outside interference."><br><br>

But if the Cup is interconnected story-wise with the plot, you should know that the news gets even crazier! What Dominic also revealed, or rather alluded to a la the whole "Kass is definitely in The Void but we're not saying it outright" method, is that Team Dacardia will finally be joining the Cup roster this year! His exact words were <b>We'll be adding a new team.</b> He went on to say <b>I guess people who've played our new mobile game, Tales of Dacardia, would probably understand that the new team would be that.</b>

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/evfvRzo.png" width="219" alt="Hope you guys know how to fight Void... creatures." title="Hope you guys know how to fight Void... creatures."><img src="http://i.imgur.com/RQR6HnF.png" width="219" alt="Hope you guys know how to fight Void... creatures." title="Hope you guys know how to fight Void... creatures."></center>

<br><br>

So if Team Dacardia is coming in, how will they balance things? We return again to speculation that one of these teams will have to sit the Cup out, probably due to the Grey Curse. Ah, but who? If that's even the plan? Maybe they'll add two teams. Probably not, though. But if they had to take a team out, maybe Virtupets because they won last year?

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/d6ANisi.png" width="450" alt="Altador Cup 2023 results" title="Altador Cup 2023 results"><br><br>

Plans change, but a hard date is rare from Neostaff. It usually means "We've got this thing ready to roll." That's why they didn't give a hard date for the Cup, they don't know when it's happening. But <b>The Void Within</b> they can say with confidence is happening on June 17th. So bank on it. The pregame is basically over now. When next we meet, it might be plot time. With it happening this soon, there's probably no more time for teasers. There's only time for preparation. Until next time, keep your weapons by your side, and think about all the questions you hope to find answers for. Stay tuuuuuuned...

</li></ul><br><b>23rd May, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>So get this. Last night <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=textfraud">Textfraud</a> was doing his dailies when he noticed the page for the Giant Omelette had been converted to the new, mobile-friendly format. He makes a <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=163190626">thread</a> about it, pointing out how mildly interesting it is that this page was converted with no announcement in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/releasenotes/">Release Notes</a> or anything. Just converted to the new layout for no reason. 

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VrGuX5W.png" width="450" alt="are they just silently converting pages now? First it was Coltzan's Shrine now it's the Giant Omelette, but unlike Coltzan's Shrine nothing has turned grey." title="are they just silently converting pages now? First it was Coltzan's Shrine now it's the Giant Omelette, but unlike Coltzan's Shrine nothing has turned grey."><br><br>

But what should happen a few hours later in the early hours of the night? A reason for the <a href="//www.neopets.com/prehistoric/omelette.phtml">Giant Omelette</a> to have its layout updated.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cjW2z2l.png" width="450" alt="Probably tastes just as good, right?" title="Probably tastes just as good, right?"><br><br>

Seems the page was updated because the Omelette was soon to turn Grey. Or Textfraud jinxed the Omelette with his words. 

<br><br>

The pickings are still good, though.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YfLx3mT.png" width="450" alt="Gotta try and cut around the Grey." title="Gotta try and cut around the Grey."><br><br>

In case there was any doubt left, this should settle it. The truly inanimate, the absolutely not alive, can be turned Grey. One could argue <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tdmbgpop.phtml">The Discarded Magical Blue Grundo Plushie of Prosperity</a> is alive. One could argue <a href="//www.neopets.com/desert/shrine.phtml">Coltzan's Shrine</a> is the body of Coltzan and not his spirit, so that counts. One could argue that the bread at <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=15">The Bakery</a> was overproofed. But the Omelette was just sitting there, being a delicious meal, and then it turned Grey. That's a curse of some sort. So you don't have to be alive to be affected by it.

<br><br>

So our list of known Grey victims, give or take one <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/grumpyking.phtml">Grumpy Old King</a>...

<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/prehistoric/omelette.phtml">Giant Omelette</a>

<br><br>

Still no word about the Cup. Assuming everything takes as long as it usually does (the Press Tour, the grace period before the Press Tour where we can all spend our prize shop points last minute), the Cup very well may start in July at this rate. But however this goes down, you shouldn't expect your "usual" Cup anyway.

The file is hard to read, but it looks like it says...

<br><br><center><b>FUGITIVE FILE</b></center>
<br><center><b>LORD KASS</b></center>

<p>

<b>Lord Kass was last seen during the attack on Meridell. Witnesses report he fled the scene. Abandoning both his blade and failed coup after a defeat at the hands of Lord Darigan.</b>

<br><br><b>There have been testimonials claiming he was destroyed at the hands of three hooded figures when he attempted to flee. This is <i>unconfirmed</i>.</b>

<br><br><b>Last known signs of Lord Kass remain at the sight of his disappearance where purple feathers beside a pile of ash. However, other testimonials stated that Trithduril disappeared without a trace from the battlefield where Lord Kass deserted it. Still unclẹar.</b>

<br><br><b>New reports have surfaced. Where witnesses to strange visions are adamant they spotted the tainted blade in an undisclosed location alongside an unknown Aisha. We are investigating the possibility that Lord Kass survived and absconded elsewhere.</b>

</p><p>

<b>-Torshac</b>

<br><br>

Who is Torshac? This is Torshac. Shoyru Scout.

<br><br></p><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/tcg/c/0089_RH16.gif" alt="Plenty of free to use characters on trading cards." title="Plenty of free to use characters on trading cards."></center>

<br><br>

Like so many old and forgotten Neopians, he's got a short <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=236">Neopedia</a> story. He sneaks around Meridell and appears to be a vigilante. So he doesn't work FOR Meridell, just "in" Meridell. It would seem. So he was with us during the raid? Some of us, anyway. He doesn't seem to recognize the winners of the contest. Or maybe that's what he wants whoever reads this file to think?

<br><br>

So what has Torshac found? Well, if you were around for <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/bfm_warroom.phtml">Battle For Meridell</a>, you already know most of this. Darigan and Kass fought, Kass was overcome, he fled into the cloisters of the Citadel where The Three punished his weakness by poofing him.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/J8Stu3Y.png" width="450" alt="Ash and feathers." title="Ash and feathers."><br><br>

But here's something interesting: Not only did Kass disappear, but his sword disappeared too. "Trithduril," Torshac calls it. The sword he dropped in battle against Lord Darigan. That, we didn't know. But with every answer comes at least another question. Why did the sword disappear? Did The Three do it? Did it disappear with Kass? It mostly serves to make more intriguing the ties The Three and Kass might have with the Void. Did Trithduril also come from the Void? Was it made by the Void? It's purple like the Void. And if The Three came from the Void, what is it the Void actually wants if it lines up with their aims? Does the tentacle creature want world domination like they seem to?

<br><br>

Speaking of that sword, there's that name. "Trithduril." We mentioned there was some confusion about the name. That confusion appears, APPEARS, to have been cleared up. But once upon a time everyone was pretty sure the sword's name was "Naralus." Let's get into why...

<br><br>

Lord Kass has two weapons of legend in his Battledome equipment. He's got a lot more weapons than that, but the two iconic weapons, the ones with "special names " are Naralus and Trithduril.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_kass_dagger.gif" alt="Naralus?" title="Naralus?"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_kass_sword.gif" alt="Trithduril?" title="Trithduril?"></center>

<br><br>

Way back in 2004, The Fan Sites of the time said that Naralus was the sword, and Trithduril was the dagger. And it sounded right, "Trith" meaning "three," sounds like a name you'd give to a three-pronged dagger. A "duril" dagger with "trith" points. Below, a screenshot unearthed from the annals of history, showing the original In-Depth Battlepedia from Pink Poogle Toy.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VK4Wr02.png" width="450" alt="Major problem with Neopets, most of its media is lost." title="Major problem with Neopets, most of its media is lost."><br><br>

In 2011, Pink Poogle Toy had to hand over their Battlepedia to Jellyneo. But if you check Jellyneo's Battlepedia, you'll see that they've named the sword Trithduril and the dagger Naralus. Why? Because that's how it's actually logged in the Neopets.com backend. In Neopets' own database, Naralus is the dagger and Trithduril is the sword. You might be thinking "What if someone is making a mistake? A mistake with the database?" After all, Pink Poogle Toy was also highly knowledgeable about the Neopets database. So how is it that they said different? No one yet liveth with the authority to explain just how we got mixed up like this. As far as authoritative and SURVIVING record, Trithduril is the name of the sword. 

<br><br>

But it wouldn't be legend if there weren't some doubt about the truth behind the tale, would it? In summary, the big takeaway from the Darigan Citadel raid? The sword's name is Trithduril. Or at least Torshac calls it that.

</li></ul><br><b>16th May, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>Not every land affected by <b>The Void Within</b> has a poster. Yet. But they are affected nonetheless. As we see from the latest victim of the Greying.

<br><br>

So who do we know that's Grey so far? From March 18th to today...

<br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/grumpyking.phtml">Skarl</a> on the other hand is still just a tease. That disappearance on April 26th has yet to resolve into anything. But while we don't know anyone in Meridell who's Grey, we do have a poster of Meridell besieged. And while we don't have a poster of Faerieland besieged, we do have at least one person/plushie we know there who is now Grey. Faerieland, Terror Mountain, and the Lost Desert have Grey cases, but no posters. Meridell, Brightvale, Haunted Woods, and Altador all have posters, but no Grey cases. And Neopia Central has both. It's looking real bad for Neopia Central.</li>

<br><br><li>It's May 16th, last year the Altador Cup Press Tour started on this day. But so far we haven't even had our usual "The <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/colosseum/prizes.phtml">Prize Shop</a> will be closing on such and such date so redeem your points now" warning. It might remind of how the Festival of Neggs started late these past couple of years. Because they had cutscenes and whatnot. Will the Cup be starting late because they have to add extra stuff to it? In addition to the week or so of time to spend our points, we also need to make time for the Press Tour. Or maybe the Press Tour isn't happening like it usually does. Maybe the Grey Curse and Orion's Prophecies take precedent?

<br><br>

The Cup and <b>The Void Within</b> are the only two events left on the schedule, they've got nothing but time for both of them. So there really isn't any rush.

<b>Aching for a more refined vacation? Fret not, the luxurious land of Altador awaits! This extravagant city, overflowing with history and living legends, may still hold unearthed secrets. Could you be the one to discover them? Perhaps… if you book a trip to Altador today!</b>

<br><br>

Just when you were about to buy that season pass for the <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/colosseum/">Altador Cup</a>. As if warning us before we all assembled there for Orion's next Prophecy, the next poster is in Altador of all places. And let's us all remember why so many people are pretty sure that, after the Cup, there's nothing left on the itinerary but <b>The Void Within</b>: Per the most recent "What's Next" section on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/releasenotes/">Release Notes</a>, there are only two events we haven't had yet. The Cup, and the Plot.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dGcQJ5Z.png" alt="Nothing else on the schedule." title="Nothing else on the schedule."></center>

<br><br>

Nothing else on the menu to eat but these two options. So there isn't much reason to NOT attack the Altador Cup. If you're a Void... tentacle... thing... hoping not to be interrupted by another event. Let's look at what we've got.

<br><br>

What's probably immediately obvious? It looks like the city is burning. Smoke or fire or something is rising in dark clouds from buildings that, like we've seen in other posters, are crumbling.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CXkpq2Y.jpg" width="450" alt="If Altador can fall, what chance does the rest of the world have?" title="If Altador can fall, what chance does the rest of the world have?"><br><br>

Inferno in a walled city? That's a surefire massacre. Haha! But seriously, folks, maybe it's not fire? We're dealing with the Void, maybe it's some kinda wispy Void energy?

<br><br>

It might be hard to notice from all the rising darkness, but one thing that isn't on this poster? Those leering eyes. There's food for thought. Why are the eyes everywhere else but here? Well, what if this is the moment where the eyes arrive in Neopia, from the Void? Maybe they're in this rising cloud. And then, from Altador, they spread across the world. There's reason to think that Altador would be the origin point of all this stuff we've been seeing on the posters. For one, the Cup is about to happen and there isn't much left in the forecast BUT the inevitable Void attack. Makes sense that one event would lead into the other. 

<br><br>

But more than a few people have noticed the creases in the poster. It really makes you wonder if the creases in ALL of these posters are significant in some way. If they mean something.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/D9mIVMP.jpg" width="450" alt="The center of the poster, with rays bursting forth" title="The center of the poster, with rays bursting forth"><br><br>

That's a weird way to fold a piece of paper. Deliberately weird, even. You only fold a piece of paper like that if you mean to make some kind of statement. Because you know what that looks like? An origin point. And the creases/rays represent the spread/emergence of Voidliness. Or maybe it doesn't start in Altador. Maybe the march starts in Meridell and ends in Altador, following the exact order the posters were released in. In either case, we still have what looks like a straight line between all of the places with posters. Plus a remainder of Neopia Central. Coincidence???

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wrXBAud.png" width="450" alt="Ever notice how the Neopian mainland looks kinda like the United States?" title="Ever notice how the Neopian mainland looks kinda like the United States?"><br><br>

So if the creases in the Altador poster mean something, what might the creases in the other posters mean? 

<br><br><center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/meridell-poster.png" width="80" alt="Meridell besieged?" title="Meridell besieged?"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/brightvale-poster.png" width="80" alt="Brightvale besieged?" title="Brightvale besieged?"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/neopiacentral-poster.png" width="80" alt="Neopia Central besieged?" title="Neopia Central besieged?"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/hauntedwoods-poster.png" width="80" alt="Haunted Woods besieged?" title="Haunted Woods besieged?"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/mountains-poster.png" width="80" alt="Mysterious mountains besieged?" title="Mysterious mountains besieged?"></center>
<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/altador-poster.png" width="450" alt="Altador besieged?" title="Altador besieged?"><br><br>

What do we see here? Well, the creases look clean and the folding scheme looks the same for all the posters up through Neopia Central. It looks like 6 to 8 segments, in 2 columns of 4. But then, in the Haunted Woods, the creases become heavy and worn. And we only get a 2x2 segment fold. By the time we get to the Mountains we get this 6 segment fold, with 3 columns of 2. The middle column being wider than the two flanking ones. And finally we end in Altador with the 9 pointed starburst effect. If it had been 12 points, or 11 points, we could've easily said "Aha! Like the (remaining) Founders of Altador!" But what could 9 points possibly mean? Or maybe it's 10 points and some creases are harder to see than others? To fold it this way, you'd have to fold it in half at different angles, right? Giving it a pair of lines each time? 

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XiokMkR.jpg" width="450" alt="A crude diagram of the lines, and where the 10th one ought to appear" title="A crude diagram of the lines, and where the 10th one ought to appear"><br><br>

It's hard to say what any of this means, if anything. But it might mean something.

<br><br>

We see another one of those Paint Brush flags... who's putting those there? And what do they mean? Surely these being Paint Brush flags must have something to do with the Paint Brush that Vira and her faerie mistress are keeping?

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/PnUeplw.png" alt="Never thought the fate of Neopia would ever hinge on a Paint Brush." title="Never thought the fate of Neopia would ever hinge on a Paint Brush."></center>

<br><br>

Did a Paint Brush do this? Or... did these little demon guys do this? The ones roosting on the roofs?

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2HCCUlI.png" width="450" alt="Enemy spotted!" title="Enemy spotted!"><br><br>

Or this... Void Gelert???

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zneuwHw.png" width="450" alt="They look like us???" title="They look like us???"><br><br>

We see a very clear enemy contingent, now. As clear as Voidish shadows can make themselves, anyway. Altador is under attack or invasion here. So maybe these guys put the flag there as, like, claiming Altador for the Void Force? The Paint Brush People? Maybe these enemies can travel through Neopia's atmosphere, like the smog that poisoned Illusen. And that's why we see faces in the sky. Like.. like you ever play Dig Dug? And you know how the enemies in Dig Dug look different when they're phasing through the earth's crust on their way to a cavern that Dig Dug... dug? And they kinda look like a pair of eyes when they do it too, right??? Maybe it's like that! Except they travel on the wind. Into your lungs, even. And maybe that's why people turn Grey! Maybe the Grey Curse is just a minor outcome of what will happen when these Void creatures REALLY start carving things up!

<br><br>

There's some disagreement over whether this says "The finest at" or "The hnest at..."

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2RngYQi.png" width="450" alt="Old timey typefaces are a headache even without Void smoke obscuring it." title="Old timey typefaces are a headache even without Void smoke obscuring it."><br><br>

But what we all seem to be in agreement on is the Balloon Carrier. Now that we have our closest look ever at them.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UEyXBSE.png" width="450" alt="Do you follow disaster, or does disaster follow you?" title="Do you follow disaster, or does disaster follow you?"><br><br>

That's for sure a Yurble. Not a Kyrii or anything else. But from the drooping ear? It looks like it's probably a Grey Yurble.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/f41oGrU.png" alt="Maybe the other Yurble could use a balloon?" title="Maybe the other Yurble could use a balloon?"></center>

<br><br>

Presently there are no Grey Yurble characters we know. So this is either someone new, or a Yurble we've already met who has been turned Grey. And this being Altador, concerns turn once again to THE Yurble.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/altador/hall/statue_06_rubble_e585a718a4.gif" alt="They can't turn him Grey, it would affect the Mini Plot!" title="They can't turn him Grey, it would affect the Mini Plot!"></center>

<br><br>

In a world of overworked and underappreciated Neopians turning Grey almost symbolically, who works harder and who has more grievance than him? But then, they can't all be pre-existing characters, can they? Even though <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop</a> seems to be on a mission to find the characters long overdue for some development. No, Nyx and her Faellie are probably not the only original characters. Especially with 10 months of plot to go through. Why would the Yurble Forefitor have a balloon, anyway? Maybe as a Cup souvenir, but this balloon seems special. Not the kind of junk you'd pay 100x markup on at the pro shop. Mostly because it keeps changing its face. In Altador it's angry, just like it was on the Mountains. Then in the Haunted Woods it looked worried to see Vira. Then for the rest of the journey it looked sad. Except for in Brightvale. You shouldn't come to conclusions if the evidence doesn't line up perfectly, but sometimes the evidence not lining up perfectly just means you've almost solved it. And it ALMOST seems like the balloon starts angry in Altador, then slowly starts to mellow into depression after meeting Vira.

<br><br>

And is that some kind of headband they're wearing? Their hair is split into two segments, right above the eye and right on top of their head. You might say "That's just the Yurble's ear, look at the other Grey Yurble image it's compared to." But unlike the generic Grey Yurble, this Yurble's hair doesn't stop just above the ear. And ears don't usually break up a hairline. Some kind of hat might, though. And speaking of the Balloon Yurble's eyes, are they closed? Or are they open? Blank and empty, like they're possessed by the Void?

<br><br>

We don't have posters for every land, but we have gone from end to end of the Neopian mainland. If the path these posters have led us on isn't a coincidence, it seems this really might be the last poster. No more teaser posters. That, coupled with how the Cup will be starting soon, points to a city of Altador that looks like it might blow at any second. Expect the unexpected this Cup season. The visions you see very well might be real this time.

No new comics, but <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=lollapaloma">Lollapaloma</a> was over at <a href="//www.neopets.com/desert/shrine.phtml">Coltzan's Shrine</a> when she discovered this...

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1B5N0xl.png" width="450" alt="Do you not see that behind you, Coltzan?" title="Do you not see that behind you, Coltzan?"><br><br>

Coltzan himself isn't Grey, not any Greyer than a ghost usually is. But his shrine is. So what is this supposed to be? Is the Shrine turning Grey supposed to be Coltzan's corporeal form turning Grey, but not his immortal soul? The Shrine isn't really his body, is it? Or is it just that the Grey Curse doesn't just affect living things, it affects inorganic matter like rocks and sculptures and it just happened to reach Coltzan's Shrine? CAN the Grey Curse affect ghosts or can Coltzan sit <b>The Void Within</b> out? You'd think he'd at least care about the fate of those who still live here. 

<br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/grumpyking.phtml">Skarl</a>, on the other hand, is still blue. 

<br><br>

We're in the second week of May so the Altador Cup Press Roll should be starting soon. Maybe we'll see even more Grey cases there? A team coming down with the Grey Curse would be a great opportunity for Team Dacardia to step in.

<br><ul><li>Graduation Day at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a>. Let us commence.

<br><br>

More like FINAL clue!

<br><br><center><b><i>Nothing gets the gears moving like a nice game of wit! You'll find these last neggs where you can try on the hottest new outfit!</i></b></center>

<br><br>

This being the final clue, you might be tempted to ignore the fact that the vast majority of these have been at shops. Final clue, they're talkin' about gears and trying on outfits, probably at Customisation or something. It's gotta be somewhere special to close this out, right? Well, you could say that. But by "gears" they mean "Cog's." As in, <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=111">Cog's Togs</a>. Where the outfits are literally hot.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jCoi7XU.png" width="450" alt="Looks like you found them! Cog picks up around the shop as soon as you find the neggs hidden in a pile of clothes.

Any more visions, Orion?

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2am6tjl.png" width="80" alt="Orion, Worried" title="Orion, Worried"><b>Now that the visions have calmed down, the original one of lava returned. And this time, much stronger. I was able to play the Lyre to intensify it for myself and saw what looked like a crevasse next to a very tall building.</b>

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2am6tjl.png" width="80" alt="Orion, Worried" title="Orion, Worried"><b>This is the last time I'll ask this of you I promise, but could you please take a look around anywhere that may fit this description and report back to me if you find anything?</b>

<br><br>

Lava? Crevasse? Tall building??? That sounds like Monty McTaggart's Magnificent <a href="//www.neopets.com/magma/index.phtml">Moltara</a> Obsidian Company!

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/t5w42JY.png" width="450" alt="In business since at least Holiday Season 2022." title="In business since at least Holiday Season 2022."><br><br>

It's easy to miss or forget if you don't spend much time in Moltara, but Moltara Obsidian has its name label again. It usually doesn't. That should tell you where you're supposed to click. But you might be looking for a crevasse, and not a big tower. Don't worry, clicking around in the background also works. Click Moltara Obsidian, click the rocks in the background, it's hard to go wrong here. 

<br><br>

The beast reveals herself...

Smaller team than the last two Petpet searches. No Landelbrot, no Kugar, no Magon, no Mira, no Tippens, no Sophie... they must all be dealing with The Greying. But our discovery has been made! Back to HQ!

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UIy74eR.png" width="80" alt="Orion, Happy" title="Orion, Happy"><b>I don't know...I suppose we are left with more questions. For now!</b>

<br><br>

As usual, for every answer we get we are repaid with another question. Let no one tell you this "Void Saga" hasn't been intriguing. Why was the Tuffala important? Because the Tuffala was carrying another piece of the puzzle. This music box cylinder. But where'd she get it? And of what significance is the music box cylinder? It seems to have made Orion feel much better. 

<br><br>

Hmmm... Lyres... Music Box Cylinders... the theme here is magical music making artefacts. The cylinder must be some kind of counterpart to the Lyre, right? How many magical instruments in the full set? Are we looking for more instruments? Or is it just the two? One found in ice and snow, the other found in fire and lava. And why does Orion feel better now? Is it because the cylinder is good, and the Lyre is evil? Or... maybe his suffering was because these instruments wanted to be together. Now that they're together, Orion's mind should be clear and he should be firing on all cylinders.

<br><br>

But surely at some point we need to find the music box this cylinder goes to, right? And this is now TWO separate ecological headaches that Monty has caused with Moltara Obsidian. We really oughta check in with the guy.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jnkOPAl.png" width="450" alt="Orion Prize - I can feel as though there is more to this mystery, but thanks to you we found something that could lead us to the answers! - Perhaps the next big gathering will help us unlock even more of this quandary...such as the Altador Cup?

So this is what the trophy hints were alluding to? An "Orions Prophecies" trophy for following all of his leads? It really was simple: There's a trophy to be earned. Disregard the crunchy look in the screenshot, the trophy has since been polished. Looks like it's made of wood.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/neggfest/y26/np/trophy_ama0u1rntf/df1j3az5ai_1.gif?v=1" alt="You were supposed to be made of Void Neggs!" title="You were supposed to be made of Void Neggs!"></center>

<br><br>

What's curious about this is, usually there's tiers to trophies. Wooden being the lowest. Stone is maybe next if you're talking about Altador Cup shields. Then you go bronze, silver, gold, maybe get some fancy stones and sparkles along the way...

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/altador/altadorcup/2010/badges/4.png" alt="Wood Tier" title="Wood Tier"><img src="//images.neopets.com/altador/altadorcup/2010/badges/8.png" alt="Stone Tier" title="Stone Tier"><img src="//images.neopets.com/altador/altadorcup/2010/badges/12.png" alt="Bronze Tier" title="Bronze Tier"></center>

<br><br>

Which suggests to some that this trophy isn't supposed to stay wooden. That throughout this evolving Void Saga, there'll be opportunities to "upgrade" the trophy. And to be fair, they did sorta warn us. But if you looked at the Festival of Neggs and thought "This has nothing to do with <b>The Void Within</b> itself, this is just for the Festival and will have no bearing on anything else as far as plot rewards," you may have reason to second-think that. Depending on where you draw the line that delineates "plot rewards." Do you consider "Orions Prophecies" to be a plot reward? Because if you skipped the Festival of Neggs, you might be set back in some larger "Follow leads from Orion's visions" puzzle or series of achievements or something to unfold.

<br><br>

The work of the Festival of Neggs is done now. Like the Faerie Festival before it, there only remain the final prizes. Maybe, like the Faerie Festival before it, we'll get another teaser comic?

Last of Orion's visions. Whatever that last vision was, he wasn't able to see it clearly enough to tell us where to go. So one last time, we're gonna have to go over the usual suspects.

The suspense... okay, tomorrow. TOMORROW we learn just what this creature is. And how it travels so fast. Orion pointed out the warp speed this thing seems to move at. It wouldn't happen to be traveling through rifts in spacetime, would it? Rifts that lead to the Void? With one day left, and that "What The Negg" image and "T-R-O-P-H-Y" still not understood, there is a tall order tomorrow (and potentially the next day) to make sense of a lot of intriguing questions.

<br><br>

Orion can only see one more place. So tomorrow can he maybe just tell us the one place to go? Does that mean it'll be the same for all of us, or will he not be able to make the vision out clearly? And this creature, of what importance might it have? Importance to <b>The Void Within</b>? Maybe this thing is from space, from the Void. Is everything from here on out part of an overarching "Void Saga?"

<br><br>

They say the slow burn provides the warmest heat. This creature can probably tell us personally. One day more.

<br><br>

So if Orion is right, and he probably is, this means two things. First, the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopies/">Neopies</a> are canon to Neopia. It's not clear how they work because they're from out-of-universe perspective as far as we can see. But second, and more importantly? We know why he had visions in February: The Lyre is strongest whenever there's a very large gathering of people in one place. A gathering large enough to be a major site event. Neopies were in February, so there was energy to see visions. And what site event is coming up in just a few short weeks?

<br><br><center><a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/colosseum/"><img src="//images.neopets.com/altador/altadorcup/altador_ac_link.gif" alt="Fanfare please..." title="Fanfare please..."></a></center>

<br><br>

The Cup is a big one, probably only <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/wintercelebration.phtml">Winter Starlight</a> could ever rival it. So look forward to somethin' big. If Fyora even lets Orion play the Lyre. Remember, she doesn't like him playing it. And she'll probably be in town for the Cup and with a gathering that big, we'll ALL be seeing fireworks. Snowbirds, give heed. There will be reasons to stick around after the Cup is over.</li>

<br><br><li>There's also, of course, the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">hunting to do</a>.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Hd43C8C.png" width="80" alt="Grey Kari, Default" title="Grey Kari, Default"><b>Hope you are ready for your next clue.</b>

Is she making puns again? The old Kari is back??? Or at least gradually returning? Day breaks over a cold morning in Neopia???

<br><br>

Yep, warmth and food. But is Orion saying he can narrow this down even further? Like, narrow down why he's going to these specific food shops or something? Or maybe he can narrow down what this Petpet is after that they could also be found, very scarcely, on Terror Mountain?

<br><br>

Something else you might've noticed if you're watching your fellow investigators. Maybe on Day 1, <b>Investigator A</b> catches a sighting at <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=49">Lost Desert Foods</a>. And <b>Investigator B</b> catches a sighting at <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=42">Tyrannian Foods</a>. Then on Day 2, <b>Investigator A</b> catches a sighting at <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=42">Tyrannian Foods</a>. And <b>Investigator B</b> catches a sighting at <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=15">The Bakery</a>. Then on Day 3, <b>Investigator A</b> catches a sighting at <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=15">The Bakery</a>. And <b>Investigator B</b> catches a sighting at <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=112">Molten Morsels</a>. At this point you should be like <b>Investigator A and Investigator B are following the same pattern, but Investigator A is a step behind Investigator B. Investigator A will next have a sighting at Molten Morsels.</b> But it's probably not just Investigators A and B. It's probably all of us. This pattern, this trail, is probably the same for all of us. And we're all on different places on it. 

<br><br>

We haven't pieced it together entirely yet, but these spots appear to be in a fixed order:

<br><br>

1. <b><a href="//www.neopets.com/island/volcano_codestone.phtml">Mystery Island Volcano</a></b><br>
2. <b><a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=49">Lost Desert Foods</a></b><br>
3. <b><a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=42">Tyrannian Foods</a></b><br>
4. <b><a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=15">The Bakery</a></b><br>
5. <b><a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=112">Molten Morsels</a></b><br>
6. <b><a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=56">Merifoods</a></b>

<br><br>

Still not clear how <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=90">Qasalan Delights</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=57">Ye Olde Petpets</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=105">The Crumpetmonger</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=36">Ice Crystal Shop</a>, and <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=37">Super Happy Icy Fun Snow Shop</a> fit into the path. But the current theory is, if you find the Petpet at Tyrannian Foods today, you'll probably find the Petpet at the Bakery tomorrow. And then Molten Morsels the next day. OR... you might be going in the other direction. If you find the Petpet at Tyrannian Foods today, you'll probably find it at Lost Desert Foods tomorrow and the Mystery Island Volcano the next day. But the evidence seems to strongly suggest that this order is fixed. We just need to know how the other 5 shops fit in.

<br><br>

With four more days of searching left, we'll certainly know by the end, if that matters.

It seems like each time you chase it away my visions dwindle. It's almost as if the creature is being chased away for good. But why would it go there in the first place?</b>

<br><br>

Chased away for good??? No, no! NO!!! Let the Petpet stay! The Bython got to stay, the Talpidat got to stay... it would seem neggs are the perfect Petpet food.</li>

<br><br><li>Speaking of Petpets, remember the <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/sfc/">Spooky Food Eating Contest</a>? And how some of us, SOME OF US, got one of those shapeshifting food eating monsters as Petpets?

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/minimonster.gif" alt="Tamed Mini-Monster" title="Tamed Mini-Monster"></center>

<br><br>

And remember how one of these shapeshifting monsters masqueraded as a Yurble named Scarlet?

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/RzUGGQ3.png" width="450" alt="Keep your eye on the Yurble..." title="Keep your eye on the Yurble..."><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BjbIu9I.png" width="450" alt="Your Yurble is now... this thing!" title="Your Yurble is now... this thing!"><br><br>

It's still not clear if Scarlet is a real Yurble, or a fake identity this monster created so he could infiltrate this contest. But what if the Balloon Carrying Yurble is actually this very shapeshifting monster? The same one who terrorized Neovia back then? What with him being known to turn into this Yurble?

<br><br>

Why even suggest this? If that is a Yurble, isn't it more likely that it's just a regular Yurble and not a shapeshifter? Well, consider that we got that poster for the mountains west of the Haunted Woods. Know what else is over in those mountains? Besides where Baelia might've been held captive by a sabbath of shadows? <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/sfc/epilogue.phtml">More of those shapeshifting monsters</a>.

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/halloween/sfc/y15/plot_epilogue.jpg" width="450" alt="They're so like us..." title="They're so like us..."><br><br>

If Baelia was held captive on this mountain range, do you think maybe some of these monsters were present for that? Not as party to it, necessarily, but maybe they saw the shadows and Jennumara (if she was even there)? If wickedness is at play over there, maybe it's had time to influence our young monster hero to make him into a reluctant monster villain? As for Scarlet, we might also get to learn if she really exists, or is a persona he created.

<br><br>

He's a boy, right? Boys have horns, girls don't? Then again, they're shapeshifters so they can probably have whatever they want.

<br><br><br><br><center><b><i>Where delights are so enticing you'd sprout wings and fly, these neggs are next to some heavenly pie!</i></b></center>

<br><br>

Y'know where you can find heavenly food that sparkles and glows with a celestial aura? And often has wings? <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=39">Faerie Foods</a>.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EmQ2nG5.png" width="450" alt="Looks like you found them! The scent of the Faerie Apple Pie they were next to is what drew you to these neggs right away!

Pie to treat/cure the Grey Curse? That actually sounds like a pretty good idea. Mysterious new... curse or disease or whatever? Should've checked at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/hospital.phtml">Hospital</a>, where they'll probably tell you "That sounds like NeoBlues, have some pie."

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0u5oXap.png" width="450" alt="NeoBlues - Your pet is feeling very down in the dumps, it shows little or no interest in playing or eating anything. - A Tasty Pie will cheer them!!!" title="NeoBlues - Your pet is feeling very down in the dumps, it shows little or no interest in playing or eating anything. - A Tasty Pie will cheer them!!!"><br><br>

If the Greying can be described as a particularly aggressive strain of NeoBlues, maybe what we need is a particularly aggressive strain of delicious pie. Pie begotten of the paradisiacal means and make of faeriekind.

<br><br>

Now let's help Orion. For most people, the same spots work for catching this creature. You're looking for the same feet and/or tails from yesterday.

Well, I suppose it's only a theory at this point but this seems connected. Maybe try and figure out if there is any sort of connection between the places it shows up.</b>

<br><br>

Food and warmth, save for the very rare scenario where you might see it on Terror Mountain somewhere. There's your connection. It's probably accustomed to food and warmth. So... why would it ever be on Terror Mountain? Well, the Lyre was on Terror Mountain. So maybe this creature was up there for the same reason? Maybe this creature and the Lyre are tied to <b>The Void Within</b> via the same plot thread? Or maybe winteriness is itself related to <b>The Void Within</b>? The Lyre was found on Terror Mountain, but the tourism posters seem to suggest that Baelia's captivity was not on Terror Mountain. It was on a different mountain. But the two mountains are united by their association with this plot. Maybe we'll find that other mountains and wintery areas are associated with this plot.

<br><br>

But first, we gotta find this creature. And then whatever the "trophy" is. With plot threads you gotta be patient. Gotta move step by step.

</li></ul><br><b>30th April, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>BUSY day at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a>... the <b>Orion Side Quest</b> has begun. But let's get the easy part out of the way first...

With all that talk about darkness and lava yesterday, you might think to go looking in places with lava. After all, some of us caught sightings at that volcano. But sightings could potentially be ANYWHERE in Neopia. Thankfully, in <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=163137044">this thread</a> on Board 7, the community seems to have narrowed it down to about 10 places. If you don't see anything here, or if you find something somewhere else, let your fellow investigators know.

When you find it, it should look something like this. See the claw to the left?

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CCIeaDu.png" width="450" alt="Grand Theft Ummagine" title="Grand Theft Ummagine"><br><br>

Click it, and right as you find it you should get a message from Orion. Maybe it's telepathic, maybe he called us on his cellphone, maybe he came with us and was nearby?

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZAzFymO.png" width="450" alt="A Message From Orion! I don't know what just happened, but my visions are a bit more clear! It seems like there are now only 7 places around Neopia flashing before my eyes. Come visit me so we can discuss the next steps!" title="A Message From Orion! I don't know what just happened, but my visions are a bit more clear! It seems like there are now only 7 places around Neopia flashing before my eyes. Come visit me so we can discuss the next steps!"><br><br>

Back to HQ, and Orion will say the following.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UIy74eR.png" width="80" alt="Orion, Happy" title="Orion, Happy"><b>So you saw something strange around the same time my visions got slightly clearer? But you didn't get a good look at it? Okay, well, that is something to work off of! Keep an eye out for more; maybe we can figure out how it's all connected!</b>

<br><br>

And with that, we are done for the day!

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UIy74eR.png" width="80" alt="Orion, Happy" title="Orion, Happy"><b>I understand if you need to rest. I'll be here tomorrow if you find anything more!</b>

<br><br>

Legwork is done, now it's time to put on our thinking caps. If you look at the image names for each thing you can see, you'll find that they're named <b>petpet_foot.png</b> and <b>petpet_tail.png</b>. As destiny seems to hold for the Festival of Neggs, we are once again looking for a Petpet. What's its name? What does it look like? Does it have some fondness for lava? And if it has a fondness for lava, why would it ever go anywhere near the Ice Crystals Shop? Well, if you View Source and Inspect around, you can actually see the Petpet, and learn its name. Though some might consider that a spoiler, so we'll leave that depth to those willing to dig. 

<br><br>

But this Petpet, does it have something to do with <b>The Void Within</b>? If Orion is getting visions of it and playing the Lyre seems to be related to it? Well, as a clairvoyant, Orion doesn't have to be limited to vision of the Void. Psychics and whatnot are supposed to be able to see more than one thing in the future, right? Otherwise he's not much of a psychic once all this Void stuff is over. But there's still that Void Negg Trophy.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fyqQWR2.png" width="450" alt="We still don't know what the negg doin.'" title="We still don't know what the negg doin.'"><br><br>

So... it seems SOMETHING Voidly must be nigh. Probably the Petpet then, right? Did it come FROM the Void? Maybe the Bython did too, maybe the Bython and this other Petpet came through a rift like the kind Nyx opened. And what about "TROPHY?" Do we get a trophy for managing to find the Petpet on each of the 8 days?

<br><br>

And about that Lyre, Fyora said not to play it? Why? For Orion's health? Because his visions are crucial to us seeing what's coming and knowing what to do about it. Has she since uncovered something about this Lyre that might suggest it's dangerous to play? Moltara did have that earthquake when he barely touched it. 

<br><br>

But what seems certain is that we're making another friend from beyond the stars. The mysteries of Voids and trophies and Lyres, though? We're still searching.</li>

<br><br><li><b>UPDATE:</b> People are collaborating on a <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=163137858">new thread</a> on Board 7, originally created as a "final" compilation of all the potential places in the Petpet's territory. Because we thought for sure we finally had them all. But very rare outliers continue to show themselves. For instance, odds are you won't find it at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=36">Ice Crystal Shop</a>. But some people are finding it there. Much less often than the other places, though. Another very rare place? <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=37">Moderately Content Icy Amusẹment Snow Shop</a>. 

<br><br>

Which makes sense. Orion saw lava in his vision, and if you exclude these two outliers, this looks like the M.O. of a creature who likes to eat and be near warmth. It's not "consistent" for it to be up north, so if it is seen there it should be, if at all, seen rarely. But we don't know much of anything for certain, we just have what looks likely. With that said, here's where MOST people are seeing sightings.

<br><ul><li>Breaking news from the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a>! Orion has seen things in dreams again. You have the option of talking to him about it. 

<br><br>

However, you should probably talk to Kari first and find your negg. There seems to be a minor glitch where the cutscene with Orion just jumps to the end if you talk to him first. People who talk to Kari first aren't getting this glitch.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/pAX8UA9.png" width="450" alt="The mark of an open world is multiple quest lines." title="The mark of an open world is multiple quest lines."><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Hd43C8C.png" width="80" alt="Grey Kari, Default" title="Grey Kari, Default"><b>Hope you are ready for your next clue.</b>

<br><br><br><br><center><b><i>These neggs are protected by some of the most glorious buddies around. If you're lucky enough to take one home you won't be let down!</i></b></center>

<br><br>

Glorious buddies. Like how Prigpants and Swolthy are buddies? A friendship between two Neopets? That would be a mistake, and you can waste a lot of time checking shops for groups of two or more Neopets. No, Orion means "buddies" like how Nyx and her Faellie are buddies. A Petpet can be a buddy. Perhaps instead focus on the "glorious" aspect. If there were buddies in Neopia, where might the "glorious" ones be? Where do you go if you're looking for "glorious" vibes? Probably the city of gold, city of the sun, Altador. Where their <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=97">Legendary Petpets</a> will make for most loyal companions during any trial.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/u31WT6p.png" width="450" alt="Looks like you found them! A Hydruplit is guarding the stash as though it is his very own hoard.

That was fun. Now back to the Festival to talk to Orion.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2am6tjl.png" width="80" alt="Orion, Worried" title="Orion, Worried"><b>I suppose I can't be certain, but the dream was dark besides that of the glow of molten lava. That has to be Moltara, right?</b>

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Hd43C8C.png" width="80" alt="Grey Kari, Default" title="Grey Kari, Default"><b>Seems like it. What does that mean though?</b>

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2am6tjl.png" width="80" alt="Orion, Worried" title="Orion, Worried"><b>I don't know. I guess I can travel there tonight after I hide tomorrow's neggs.</b>

<br><br>

That story again: Moltara suspected to be the site of some sort of... mysterious happening! Get ready to suit up, our investigation will be taking us to Moltara.

<br><br>

But is that the right spot? Is Moltara actually what Orion saw in his dream? <b>The dream was dark besides that of the glow of molten lava.</b> Moltara does have molten lava. Or magma. Whatever name you wanna give it. And wouldn't it be great to go back to Moltara Obsidian and see that Monty was up to something? He ditches the Obsidian, and his next business venture is that which sets Vira's and her faerie mistress's plan into further motion? There's still that speculation that he might be Nyx's boss who sent her into space for something.

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/faeriefestival/2023/np/characters/MontySmugLeft.png" width="450" alt="Void crystals probably make great fuel!" title="Void crystals probably make great fuel!"><br><br>

But Moltara isn't the only place in Neopia with lava/magma. The <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/volcano_codestone.phtml">Mystery Island Volcano</a>, for instance. Some call it Techo Mountain, some say "No, Techo Mountain is the sculpture next to the volcano, the volcano itself is called Piku Paku. Very common mistake." Whatever the truth is, one thing that's true is that it is very much active.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/island/kougra_02.gif" alt="Don't wake Moltenus!" title="Don't wake Moltenus!"></center>

<br><br>

Another famous volcano? The one in Tyrannia. Can be seen in the distance from the <a href="//www.neopets.com/prehistoric/plateau.phtml">Plateau</a>, but it can't be visited anymore. If you try, they <a href="//www.neopets.com/prehistoric/volcano.phtml">send you back</a>. But once upon a time you could...

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/prehistoric/volcanomap.gif" width="450" alt="Everyone eventually left because the heat was unbearable." title="Everyone eventually left because the heat was unbearable."><br><br>

Maybe over the next few days we'll visit not just Moltara, but Mystery Island, Tyrannia, and anywhere else that might have lava/magma? Looking for things that might mean something? Maybe this is where Orion's Side Quest begins.

<br><br>

But wait, there's one more place that might have some lava. And as it was in Orion's dream? It's dark. <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/index_evil.phtml">Darigan Citadel</a>.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/i6BFC3u.png" width="450" alt="You might say it is, itself, one big volcano." title="You might say it is, itself, one big volcano."><br><br>

See that red chasm in the center? That's probably lava, right? And like Moltara, we have at least one strong suspect related to Darigan Citadel. Something might be going on in Moltara because Monty is tied to Malkus who is tied to Vira and her faerie mistress. But something might be going on in Darigan Citadel because of Kass. And Lord Darigan too, while we're at it. He was probably sent to where ever Kass was, by order of The Three.

<br><br>

And speaking of Darigan Citadel, with the votes of that Darigan Citadel raid Customisation Contest having ended and finals to soon begin, maybe the Puzzle Hunters will have some findings to publish? Maybe said findings will line up with whatever Orion finds? Maybe Orion and the Puzzle Hunters and everyone else will follow the trail of clues and intuition back to Darigan Citadel?

<br><br>

Fitting that we should find ourselves caught up in this mystery of a curse that has taken the color and light out of our lives, and have so much suspicion and concern for Darigan Citadel. They know as good as anyone what it's like have vibrance and splendor, but then lose it all.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9HPtWkx.png" width="450" alt="If Faerieland can be on the ground, why not Darigan Citadel?" title="If Faerieland can be on the ground, why not Darigan Citadel?"></li></ul><br><b>28th April, 2024</b>

<br><br>

There's a few languages spoken in Neopia, but perhaps the most misunderstood are the Tyrannian dialects. So, a trinket shop where the shopkeeper speaks a peculiar language? Gotta be THE trinket shop, <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=117">Ugga Shinies</a>.

There's been a few glitches going around, minor ones. Neggs you've found not appearing in your log, for instance. Don't worry, they're in your log, you just gotta refresh a little. Also, some people are noticing that things that should be random around Neopets.com are... not as random. Some people. That one's a little harder to pinpoint.

No one should hear you yelp? Hmmmm... okay that's noticeably more challenging than what we've been getting. Where might it be bad to yelp? Maybe the Snowager's lair? Hmmmm... these negg spots are usually shops of some kind though. What "shop" might it be frowned upon to yelp? Where would loud noises ruin things? A library! Maybe the Bookshop in Central? Or the Faerieland Bookshop? No... it's <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=70">Booktastic Books</a>, in fact!

The <b>Orion Side Quest</b> has not yet begun, but he's already bringing some leads to chew on. As Neostaff said in the Live, Orion has been having trouble seeing any new visions. But what they didn't mention was the part where Orion said <b>I was plagued for a bit once again during the month of Awakening, but neither I nor Queen Fyora could make sense of those visions.</b> What happened during the month of Awakening (that's February to us Earthlings) that Orion experienced a sudden but brief spout of insight? And when might it have happened? Because the Greyings started on March 18th, not February. As far as we know, anyway. Maybe someone was secretly Greying and the public just had no idea?

<br><br>

We have no posts here for February 2024, but let's look back on the recent month anyway. Those Puzzle Hunters have a made a case for looking back at past New Features entries for clues.

<br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2024-01-29">Week of January 29th</a>
<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2024-02-05">Week of February 5th</a>
<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2024-02-12">Week of February 12th</a>
<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2024-02-20">Week of February 20th</a>
<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2024-02-26">Week of February 26th</a>

<br><br>

February is the Valentine's Month, that's the first obvious answer. But this was also when the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopies/">Neopies</a> were going on. Maybe that had something to do with it? We also had <font color="purple"><b>Jhudora</b></font> <font color="green"><b>Day</b></font> that month. Could something be in the cards that involves Jhudora? Whose side is she on? Maybe she did something that triggered Orion's Orion-Sense? For good or ill?

<br><br>

Other than that, nothing seems to stand out. No letters taken out, no old posts changed. So now we have another question among so many: What happened in February? And what did Orion see? Maybe what's depicted on these recent posters? Again, those didn't start in February. But then, maybe he saw them ahead of us. Still, what happened in February to show him these visions?

<br><br>

Maybe we need to keep an eye on Jhudora. And Illusen, for that matter. Haven't heard from them since the Faerity Questival.</li>

<br><br><li>The raid on Darigan Citadel will be coming to an end soon. AKA, it's April 26th and votes just closed in that Facebook contest. Anything happen while we were busy? Yes. Something just happened today. To <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/grumpyking.phtml">another high profile Neopian</a>.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/rSCBQeE.png" width="450" alt="Got ourselves another Case of the Missing King..." title="Got ourselves another Case of the Missing King..."><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CbRL7xk.png" width="450" alt="Got ourselves another Case of the Missing King..." title="Got ourselves another Case of the Missing King..."><br><br>

You probably know what this is supposed to be. Some on <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=163127709">Board 7</a> think this is just a normal glitch, but if you remember the Grooming Parlour Usul and how her image disappeared for a while, you know in your heart what happened: Skarl has turned Grey. Neostaff will probably get around to fixing it soon, maybe even today. It's not the weekend yet. But this curse is affecting heads of state now. We've got a monarchical crisis on our hands! What might Meridell's enemies try if they knew this was going on? Would Darigan take advantage of this weakness? If this continues, the international community will be thrown into chaos! If it isn't already!

<br><br>

Not a lot of people saw what happened to Skarl, pun intended. But many more DID catch this while collecting their <a href="//www.neopets.com/bank.phtml">daily interest</a>.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/axbzyd5.png" width="450" alt="Even the Neopoints are dull now!" title="Even the Neopoints are dull now!"><br><br>

Skarl is one thing. But now they're messin' with our money. It's open season on Neopia's favorite Skeiths, how much more of this can we take??? Can a Grey Neopia even function???

<br><br>

One small sliver of hope, it doesn't seem like anyone's concerned that this is contagious. So it probably isn't. If there were credible concerns that it were contagious, Orion probably would've worn a mask.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/swm_mask.gif" alt="It's for your health and everyone else's." title="It's for your health and everyone else's."></center>

<br><br>

But this is spreading somehow. If not virally, it means someone's out there changing people. Maybe we can help Orion find them before the Festival's done.</li>

<br><br><li><b>SLIGHT UPDATE:</b> Skarl is no longer missing. <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=alioldman">AliOldman</a> stopped by <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/grumpyking.phtml">Grumpy Old King</a> later in the day and instead of seeing a fixed image with a Grey Skarl, he just saw the regular Skarl we all know and/or love.

<br><br>

But the image does exist. When will those who visit Skarl see him in his Grey Form? No one knows yet. Maybe tomorrow? Watch this space.

</li></ul><br><b>25th April, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>Day 3 of the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a>. Fatigue is already starting to set in for Kari. But then, fatigue started setting in well before the Festival began.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Hd43C8C.png" width="80" alt="Grey Kari, Default" title="Grey Kari, Default"><b>I've got another clue for you...</b>

<br><br><br><br><center><b><i>You'll sure be bouncy if you...ah, I can't think of a rhyme! The neggs are in the Roo Island Souvenirs shop.</i></b></center>

<br><br>

A real brainbender. But leading speculation suggests that today's negg is most likely at <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=76">Roo Island Souvenirs shop</a>.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/WHKstwW.png" width="450" alt="Looks like you found them! Kari is already there holding the neggs. Kari holds them out to you. Sorry, about today.

I'll do better tomorrow I promise. In the meantime, which negg do you want?"><br><br>

Greyness hasn't slowed her down one bit though.

<br><br>

You didn't see anything weird on the way here though, did you? When Orion gets here we can tell him all about it. Really start collaborating on our findings.

</li></ul><br><b>24th April, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>Day 2 of the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a>, and the quest for understanding (and neggs) continues.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Hd43C8C.png" width="80" alt="Grey Kari, Default" title="Grey Kari, Default"><b>Another clue is ready for your review.</b>

<br><br><br><br><center><b><i>You'll easily find these neggs somewhere sweet if you think lakes are neat.</i></b></center>

<br><br>

Kari's words still lack the energy of Festivals prior. Anyway, sweets? A lake? Wouldn't be <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=66">Kiko Lake Treats</a> would it?

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Yt5AYWo.png" width="450" alt="Looks like you found them! The neggs are in a bowl next to some chocolate. Hopefully, the shopkeep wasn't about to cook them! Kari pours the neggs out of the bowl. Maybe a treat will help cheer me up...but first which negg do you want?" title="Looks like you found them! The neggs are in a bowl next to some chocolate. Hopefully, the shopkeep wasn't about to cook them! Kari pours the neggs out of the bowl. Maybe a treat will help cheer me up...but first which negg do you want?"></center>

<br><br>

Kari is really slippin'. By the way, that Time Travel Negg? It appears to only offer prizes from Negg Festivals in years past. Most of which you could probably just buy. So if negg priority was a factor... <img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/unsure.gif"> Also? Its inclusion may have less to do with the themes of this year's festival and more to do with how Neostaff probably just wanted to give us a shot at retired prizes.

<br><br>

Still no Void Negg trophy. One wonders where Kari's best friend and roommate Mira is. Maybe she's in space, investigating the Void? Maybe she'll bring back a trophy made of Void Neggs or something?</li>

<br><br><li>Someone will eventually come along and jolt this investigation. After all, that's how it was for the last two investigations. Plus we've seen Orion's hands hovering over that Trophy of Neggs. So developments are on the way.

<br><br>

But <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=biscuitism">Biscuitism</a> was not content to wait for answers. She decided to dig around in the FAQ, and stumbled upon this. This thing that is not included in the regular Festival of Neggs FAQ. The <b>Orion Side Quest</b>.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FWZQjWa.png" width="450" alt="Orion Side Quest on the Support site." title="Orion Side Quest on the Support site."><br><br>

It hasn't started yet, like Orion's Tarot thing from last year it's coming later. But we can look ahead to it by reading what the FAQ says about it.

<br><br><center>
<b>
What exactly does Orion want me to do?

<br><br><i>Orion is asking for help searching all around Neopia to find anything out of the ordinary! So, while you are searching for Kari's neggs, perhaps you can pop around other places as well to see if you can spot anything odd.</i>

<br><br>

I think I have found something strange. What next?

<br><br><i>If you think you've found something make sure to check in with Orion. If it's something he thinks could be of importance he will most likely have something to say on the matter. If you aren't certain you've found something still feel free to check in with him. What he has to say might help you know if you've found something in general.</i>

<br><br>

How often should I be looking for something strange?

<br><br><i>Orion doesn't want anyone getting overworked so once you're certain you've found something and you told Orion about it, you should take a break for the day and go searching more tomorrow! If you miss a day or two though, you can make up for lost time by trying to find multiple strange occurrences. However, make sure to keep checking in with Orion whenever you can, as he'll be on the lookout for when you should take another break!</i>

<br><br>

Is there a reward for helping Orion?

<br><br><i>Of course! Orion sort of has his hands full at the moment, but if you can help him solve this mystery he'll be sure to reward you!</i>

<br><br>

Okay, but what exactly am I looking for?

<br><br><i>It's hard to say, but you'll know it when you see it! Stay vigilant of your surroundings and be sure to give sidelong looks wherever you go! You never know when something may be hiding in the corner of your eyes!</i>

<br><br>

I missed some days but can only find one strange sighting?

<br><br><i>Make sure you report the strange sighting to Orion before looking for more! He might even have some interesting thoughts that could help you determine where to look next.</i>

<br><br>

Do I have to help Orion?

<br><br><i>Short answer: Nope. Longer answer: Still nope, but we highly recommend it! If you want to only find the neggs, just talk to Kari each day to avoid hearing from Orion from now on. However, Orion's visions may lead down a path that we think you wouldn't want to miss out on!</i>
</b>
</center>

<br><br>

Now there's a headscratcher. What exactly are we looking for? Oh, we'll know it when we see it. The painter, the faerie, these villains out to make their mark... are they already out marking? Should we be worried? Are we gonna run into the sorts of stuff we saw on those posters? Or maybe we'll find loose Void Neggs that we make into a trophy?

<br><br>

But whatever happens, you'll be ready. You showed up for a hunt, and you'll have it.

</li></ul><br><b>23rd April, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>Impatient for more clues? More development on this case? How does a <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2024-04-22">new poster</a> grab you? Haunted Woods was not the end of our poster journey, but this might be.

<p> 
<b>Mountains make marvellous memories. Come brave the rugged hiking trails between Altador and the Haunted Woods, where you'll be greeted by breathtaking views and diverse wildlife!</b>
</p>
<center><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/mountains2-poster.png" width="300" border="0"></center>

<br><br>

Another curveball! It's not a land anyone was expecting, it's not a land that really has a canon name. It's that OTHER mountain range. That one that seems like it would be great to do something with but it's hard to come up with anything because we already have Terror Mountain? 

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SBEvnrJ.png" width="219" alt="Head west..." title="Head west..."><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CY5k0tE.png" width="219" alt="Right here!" title="Right here!"></center>

<br><br>

You could've swapped in land names from <b>altador-poster.png</b> to <b>virtupets-poster.png</b> and never found this. Because this isn't a land you can visit on the map. This is <b>mountains2-poster.png</b>. Why "mountains2?" Because <b>mountains-poster.png</b> is reserved for the borderless version with the higher resolution.

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/mountains-poster.png" width="450" alt="Maybe this is the one they should've put in the news instead?" title="Maybe this is the one they should've put in the news instead?"><br><br>

With a bigger, more detailed version, let's break it down. We've got more eyes and shadows...

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HtiaGeD.png" alt="Some lands have bones, some lands have flowers, but all have eyes in shadow." title="Some lands have bones, some lands have flowers, but all have eyes in shadow."></center>

<br><br>

But y'know with them in this big mass like this, enshrouded in shadow? With a grasping hand attached? Two things come to mind: The shadows that Krawley conjured in <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/hwp/solution.phtml">Tale of Woe</a>...

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/iQcDCqA.png" alt="If there's anyone we need answers about in Neopia, it's Krawley." title="If there's anyone we need answers about in Neopia, it's Krawley."><br><br>

...and the shadows from Baelia's <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=179">Neopedia</a> story.

<br><br><b>Thunderclouds loom over the top of the mountain, rain coming down like hammers and nails. Locked in her iron cage, she shivers while the shadows whisper their teasing taunts. The thunder rolls, and she looks up at the sky.</b>

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/neopedia/179_grey_faerie.gif" alt="Mysterious shadows, soon to be revealed?" title="Mysterious shadows, soon to be revealed?"></center>

<br><br><b>Just then, the shadows peel away, and a <i>darker</i> shadow appears. Her eyes mocking and triumphant, she stands over the cage. "No one is coming to rescue you," the shadow tells her. "You are trapped here forever, because I know the secret: a Faerie without wings is completely helpless!</b>

<br><br>

Unlike Krawley's shadows, the ones on this poster are depicted on a mountain. Are these the same shadows from Baelia's story? In that case, this mountain, it must be the same mountain from the story, right? The same mountain Baelia was held captive on? Furthermore, any time we saw disembodied eyes in any of the other posters, does that mean those eyes were those same shadows from the mountains? The shadows that work for or with Jennumara? It's this that raises the possibility that this might be the last poster we get. Will other lands get hit with paint/graffiti/Void/whatever? Probably, and it would be great to see posters of them all. But if <b>The Void Within</b> is about Baelia, then maybe it's fitting to end the poster teasers where our introduction to her began. This is where the Grey Faerie story as far as we're coincerned, and the story of this plot probably, began. And it's probably where the shadows that caused all that graffiti came from. This is maybe not just where Baelia's story began, but where the Paint Brush's defacement of the world began.

<br><br>

We see a gangrel hand in the upper right corner...

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zhzTG9b.png" alt="That is a hand, right?" title="That is a hand, right?"></center>

<br><br>

Looks like it could belong to Vira's faerie mistress? We saw what looked like Vira in the last poster, maybe now we see her mistress? But if this is where Baelia was held captive, wouldn't that definitely mean Vira's faerie mistress is Jennumara? It adds up that this Paint Brush that makes all sorts of weird shadow chaos appear should come from the faerie with weird shadow minions. But then, she looks so much like Drakara! Maybe the resemblance to Drakara is coincidental. Or maybe Drakara is the third friend? But if the hand belongs to Jennumara, who is the Balloon Carrier? Or rather, why is the Balloon Carrier there?

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/v2fVblJ.png" alt="What a coincidence, it's you again." title="What a coincidence, it's you again."></center>

<br><br>

Look at that balloon, looks a lot angrier than usual, doesn't it? Maybe the Balloon Carrier started out angry, made their way to the Haunted Woods where they met Vira, and then they went from angry to wary? And then... sad and manipulated? And then angry again by the time they got to Brightvale? Maybe they went looking for something where Baelia was being kept, but they were disappointed? And then Vira was like "Hey I'm sorry you're disappointed but I've got an idea for you?" Whoever this Balloon Carrier is, whatever they're looking for, they're clearly unhappy. 

<br><br>

There's still the idea that this Balloon Carrier might be Tavi.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/neopedia/179_free_faerie.gif" alt="The ears aren't quite right, but look at that mane!" title="The ears aren't quite right, but look at that mane!"></center>

<br><br>

Note the dropped lantern in the bottom right corner. Could it be Tavi's?

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hnbYJTt.png" alt="A lantern is one of three things that would be in a mountain climber's pack, right?" title="A lantern is one of three things that would be in a mountain climber's pack, right?"></center>

<br><br>

But if that's Tavi, where is Baelia? And why would Tavi carry around a balloon? Ah, but what if Baelia IS the balloon??? What if the balloon is just a symbolic representation of Baelia? After being freed from captivity and set on the path to finding a new name for herself, she would probably be angry at the people who did this to her. She'd probably be determined to get her own back. If the Balloon Carrier ISN'T Tavi, and the balloon isn't Baelia... then WHY would anyone carry around a balloon like this? To all these places that just happen to get attacked with reality warping shadows? That may or may not be the product of some dark faerie's dark paint brush?

<br><br>

Here's one thing we can probably be certain of: If this graffiti is meant to represent stuff that's actually happening in each region, then what's depicted in the posters has not happened yet. Which means this is not a scene from the day Baelia was rescued. If the Balloon Carrier is Tavi and the balloon is Baelia, the two of them didn't immediately leave the area and then go see a bunch of lands get bones and flowers painted all over them. Because Baelia was rescued long ago. And as far as we know these grasping shadows have not attacked the realm yet. So if the Balloon Carrier is Tavi and the balloon is Baelia, they must've gone back here for some reason. Maybe to find something. Maybe to find closure.

<br><br>

If you take nothing else away from this, take away the idea that this poster depicts the place where Jennumara and her shadows held Baelia captive. It seems very likely right now.

<br><br>

Tomorrow we'll have another negg to find in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival</a>. With it only lasting 2 weeks, we surely won't have to wait long for more cutscenes.

Kari is stricken with the Grey Curse. An army of volunteers descends upon the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a> in search of answers. Who else is here? Anybody seen any trophies?

Looks like right  now it's just Kari. And she's mostly interested in having an enjoyable Negg Fest.

<br><br>

Near some treats that everyone agrees are edible? Plenty of places to buy food, but if it's somewhere "central," it's gotta be the <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=1">Food Shop</a>.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/OxcF7Ic.png" width="450" alt="You find the neggs just sort of placed on the counter. Kari sort of shly picks them up. Great job finding these!

Just sort of placed on the counter. She's doing her best, though. 

<br><br>

Speaking of mistakes, there's a ongoing glitch right now where selecting a negg will simply lead you to a blank white page. Neostaff should get on that soon, but for the time being some people are getting through it simply by refreshing and trying to select their negg again.

<br><br>

Neggs are nice, but it's hard to focus on neggs when there's a Greydemic going on. We're all here, armed to the teeth, poring over notes from investigations... but even though she's operating at a noticeably diminished capacity, Kari doesn't wanna make a fuss. We do, though. What does "T-R-O-P-H-Y" mean? Are we looking for one? Where's Orion? Where's Mira? We need people on this Grey case! We need answers! The FAQ gives us a little under the <b>What's wrong with Kari?</b> question.

<br><br><b><i>Kari has been affected by what many in Neopia are calling the grey curse. However, no one really knows anything about it so we can't be sure if it's a curse, an aliment, or what! All we know is that it is somehow affecting Neopians all over the lands and nothing seems to be able to cure it. Things such as Paint Brushes and Morphing Potions seem to have no effect. Not even Naia's Rainbow Fountain can change one back from being grey!</i></b>

So there's that. This pandemic has a name in the Neopian press. "The Grey Curse."

<br><br>

First day is a day and a half, so the next day doesn't start until April 24th.</li>

<br><br><li>While we wait for answers, we still have speculation. Now, the five findable neggs in any Festival are themed after the Festival itself. Last year's Festival was space-themed, so we got space-themed neggs. And this year's Festival is themed after <b>The Void Within</b> and the developments therein, right? If so, if the neggs match the Festival theme and the Festival theme matches the plot, then logically the theme of the neggs matches the theme of the plot, right? Maybe? So if we got spacey neggs last year, let's have a look at the uniting theme between this year's neggs.

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/negg_grey.gif" alt="Grey Negg" title="Grey Negg"><b>Grey Negg</b>
<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/negg_glitch.gif" alt="Glitch Negg" title="Glitch Negg"><b>Glitch Negg</b>

<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/negg_plushie.gif" alt="Plushie Negg" title="Plushie Negg"><b>Plushie Negg</b>

<br><br>

We see Greyness... we see... recovery and comfort in the Spa Negg and maybe the Plushie Negg? But the Glitch Negg and Time Travel Negg are especially intriguing. Safe answer is, this means <b>The Void Within</b> will deal in some manner of cosmic weirdness. But maybe these neggs aren't just vaguely themed after the plot. Maybe they reference specific things we'll see. Glitches and aberrations in the world? You mean like those posters we saw? If you saw reality warping around you, you might call that a "glitch" of life. So might time travel itself come up in the plot?

<br><br>

It's only the first day and half, let's not rush Kari. She's noticeably low on energy. This thing is scheduled to last until May 8th. By then, whatever "TROPHY" means, we should have our answer. But things are sure to happen between then and now, and we'll be keeping score.

</li></ul><br><b>21st April, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>The <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a> is tomorrow! If you've been sniffing around, you might've even found some "leaks" or whatever name you wanna give 'em. We will not be discussing those quite yet. But what we can discuss is that which Neostaff puts out themselves. Like this last minute glimpse into what this year's Festival will be about theme-wise and stylistically.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3xKfJK8.png" width="450" alt="What's this?! Something is definitely going on in Neopia.. The Festival of Neggs is nearing closer, but what will be in store this year? Only time will tell! *cackles in TNT* Okay, fine!

Speaking of leaks, apparently Neostaff posted this one early over on Instagram. They took it down, but the very brief sight of it was enough to spook the economy into skyrocketing the price of Void Neggs. A highly volatile, highly speculative investment, these Void Neggs. Ever since this plot earned the name <b>The Void Within</b>.

<br><br>

But what is that shape being formed with those Void Neggs? Some kind of trophy? And whose hands are those nearby? Maybe... Orion? 

<br><br>

In less than a day, surely at least one of these questions will be answered. Rest up tonight for a very strange, very surreal Festival tomorrow.

</li></ul><br><b>19th April, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>As expected, we got that fourth poster in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2024-04-15">New Features</a> today. Unexpectedly? It was not posted on social media.

<p>
<b>Yearning for a spooky surprise? The Haunted Woods awaits! This enigmatic forest holds unforgettable adventures lurking within its twisted branches. From rusty carnival rides to abandoned homes to peculiar shops packed with unusual delights, the Haunted Woods has everything needed to sate your creepy cravings!</b>
</p>
<center><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/hauntedwoods-poster.png" width="300" border="0"></center>

<br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=angelgrrrl25">Angelgrrrl25</a> and her daughter have both been following the proceedings. Angelgrrrl25's daughter brought up how worn this poster looks compared to the other ones. Is that important? Is this poster meant to stand out among the other ones? The Haunted Woods themselves meant to stand out among lands that get hit by this transformation? Is the Haunted Woods particularly important?

<br><br>

Not as wide a shot as the other three posters. So not a lot to pick through. But what this poster lacks in quantity, it makes up for in at least one definitive piece of the puzzle.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uMbm1oc.png" width="450" alt="Behind every Yurble with a balloon is someone reminding them to hold on." title="Behind every Yurble with a balloon is someone reminding them to hold on."><br><br>

Once again, our Balloon Yurble/Tax Beast/Kyrii/Whatever. We're closer than ever now. Close enough to see clearly who it is behind them. Who was probably behind them in Neopia Central. That's Vira. Right? Almost positively?

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/ncmall/collectibles/11_04/nc-collectible.jpg" alt="Spit and image." title="Spit and image."></center>

<br><br>

If that's Vira, that probably answers one thing about the Balloon Carrier: They are the third friend. If Vira is hanging out with them? And if they keep showing up with Vira to these disaster sites, they're probably the Painter too. So is this our villainous three? A mysterious faerie, Vira, and a mysterious Balloon Carrier and Painter? And look at how apprehensive the balloon looks here. If the balloon is a reflection of the emotions the Balloon Carrier is feeling, they don't seem to be that certain about about how genuine a friend Vira is. Looks like Vira, and by extension this faerie mistress, are both using the Balloon Carrier. They probably needed a patsy or living tool like the Balloon Carrier to use their Paint Brush weapon, and the Balloon Carrier was just the candidate. 

<br><br>

Despicable! But you know what else? Vira was a victim once too. Good people can be led astray. So maybe, just maybe, there's redemption for this friendship. <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=_hermes_32">_Hermes_32</a> thinks so, at least. Remember how Jewel was talking about how she was writing a character defining moment for this plot, where two characters were coming to certain terms in their relationship? What if that's between Vira and this Balloon Carrier? And where at one point Vira was the Balloon Carrier's ticket to darkness, the Balloon Carrier becomes Vira's ticket to redemption. Vira comes clean, repents of her sins, becomes a real friend to the Balloon Carrier and the two of them team up to save Neopia from making the same mistakes they did. If Kass is in this thing, you gotta wonder if themes of redemption will feature prominently. Darigan made the same mistakes Kass did, and redeemed himself. So surely Kass can redeem himself. And if Kass is redeeming himself, why don't we all redeem ourselves? Let's ALL be better people, right? 

<br><br>

But if this is the journey our Balloon Carrier is headed for, it'd be nice to know who they are. Yurble Forefitor? Maybe. But what we maybe don't consider enough is that the Balloon Carrier might be an original character. A plot can't just be all pre-existing characters, can it? It... probably never has been before. Nyx is an original character, it'd be odd to stop at just one. Or two, if you wanna count Orion.

<br><br>

We also got more of your favorites, like ooze dripping from mouths...

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7Ku0CXC.png" width="450" alt="Wonder if that liquid was ever someone solid?" title="Wonder if that liquid was ever someone solid?"><br><br>

Mysterious leering eyes...

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GgSA7Fc.png" alt="Bizarre aberrations are par for the course in the Woods." title="Bizarre aberrations are par for the course in the Woods."></center>

<br><br>

More abstract reflections of the soul of the artist? <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=kh2riku_3">KH2Riku_3</a> introduces this idea: What if they're motes? Like the kind you see in magic? For instance, Novas are a kind of mote.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/frontpage/nova_day_2005.gif" alt="Regular, Super, Ultra, and Dark." title="Regular, Super, Ultra, and Dark."></center>

<br><br>

And there are the motes you find at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=82">Motery</a> in Brightvale.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/ncmall/collectibles/case/collections/all_hail_brightvale/nc-collectible.jpg" alt="What is someone who wields motes? A motegician? Alchemotist? Motorist?" title="What is someone who wields motes? A motegician? Alchemotist? Motorist?"></center>

<br><br>

See how they have eyes/faces? Maybe this plot will go a way towards establishing motes as fundamental building blocks of magical energy. And these are "Void Motes" or something.

<br><br>

More creeping Grey, more bones and flowers...

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TVilLPG.png" width="450" alt="More often found in soft soil than on the cobblestones of Brightvale." title="More often found in soft soil than on the cobblestones of Brightvale."><br><br>

Evil eyes, creeping Grey, bones and flowers. A pattern is emerging. Are the bones meant to contrast with the flowers? Is that why they're appearing together? So that we have this "dark meets light" effect? Or... let's consider the similarities instead. What might bones and flowers have in common? They both might be found at a grave. That might be why they appear together. This... defacement... is meant to "give" themes of a grave site. And y'know what's known for graveyards? The Haunted Woods, where this poster is based.

<br><br>

Maybe... just maybe... these posters tell us not just which lands are gonna be hit, but in what order. And maybe why these particular things are appearing. Flowers + bones = graveyard, maybe. Which, again, Haunted Woods has some lovely graveyards. But y'know what else it has? Or had once upon a time before the maps were revamped? Eyes lurking in the darkness. Just have a look at one of Neopia's older corners: The <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/hall_market.phtml">Haunted Marketplace</a>. Hasn't ever been "revamped" or "converted" or anything. Few remain who know this place even exists.

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/halloween/hall_market.gif" width="450" alt="It's always the year 2000 here." title="It's always the year 2000 here."><br><br>

Maybe all these eyes and bones and flowers are because the Balloon Carrier/Painter started carving their swath from the Haunted Woods? The Haunted Woods was itself an influence in the paintings they painted? Maybe something there powers it or something. The Haunted Woods has all this stuff already, so maybe this stuff came from the Haunted Woods. Or maybe the Balloon Carrier/Painter just likes the Haunted Woods, or has the Haunted Woods on their mind. Maybe that's why they were found there, and why they paint a Haunted theme where ever they go. In fact, if they're sad and visiting the Haunted Woods and thinking about graves... maybe a loved one recently passed? And it's this vulnerability that Vira and her faerie mistress prey on? Although... one would hope there are other places to rest in peace besides the Haunted Woods. Maybe they brought their loved one to the Haunted Woods in hopes of raising them to undead life? Yadda yadda yadda, Vira arms them with the Paint Brush and they go from the Woods, to Neopia Central, then cut around and go through Brightvale and Meridell?

<br><br>

But hold on, speaking of these bones, what about the skulls? If they even are skulls. What is this at the bottom of the poster?

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LwzHI6J.png" width="450" alt="Another round thing in the ground." title="Another round thing in the ground."><br><br>

Another skull? If we even are looking at skulls? Let's have another look at that specimen from Brightvale.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tn5dYYZ.png" alt="It could always be a Snowbunny or a wheel of cheese." title="It could always be a Snowbunny or a wheel of cheese."></center>

<br><br>

If this even is a skull, it would be half-buried in the ground, hole in its forehead, looking upward and to the left? So if that's a skull, is the thing at the bottom of the Haunted Woods poster also a skull? But maybe lying on its side? Lying on its left side? Because if these are both skulls, what's that wing-shaped thing on each of their right temples? Shaped kinda like faerie wings? Hmmmm... ears typically don't have bones, do they? But what about faerie ears? Because faerie ears are pointy and elven, like whatever these wing-shaped things are. Could these be the skulls, the bones, of faeries??? Ears with bones in them might seem wild, so maybe they're not "ears." But what are they? Maybe just an original creation of the artist painting these lands with their nightmare art?

<br><br>

And to wrap up this study of the Haunted Woods poster, we have this thing lingering out of frame. All the way on the right, next to the puking tree.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ABzwFvg.png" alt="The most intriguing skull yet?" title="The most intriguing skull yet?"></center>

<br><br>

Most of it is out of the shot, but you can see part of it that should look familiar...

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/N59UySA.png" alt="Proof of the Paint?" title="Proof of the Paint?"></center>

<br><br>

There it is, the emblem of the Paint Brush that covered Brightvale. But... is it really there? Or is it just an abstract representation of the fact that the notorious Paint Brush is what painted the Woods and made them look like this? Because if it's not, if some spiral-horned skull-something actually appears in the Haunted Woods, what is it? Or WHO is it? How does it/they fit into this ever-expanding cast? We've got Vira and the Painter potentially teetering on the edge of redemption, the faerie mistress that might be trying to keep them committed to evil, we've got Nyx, we've got whoever the "certain faerie" is, we've got the tentacle creature... and now we've got this??? And... is that a second skull under the first one? Like a "skull totem pole?"

<br><br>

And that oughta do it for this week of content. Come Monday, we'll have a shiny new <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a>, where hopefully we can start confirming some of these theories we've got. To conclude, let's go over some of the big questions on the minds of <b>The Void Within</b> inquirers...

<br><br>

1. <b>What does the poster graffiti actually mean? Why these bones and flowers? If a door gets blocked up, are you trapped inside?</b><br>
2. <b>Who is the Balloon Carrier?</b><br>
3. <b>Who is the Painter?</b><br>
4. <b>What is the Paint Brush and what is it capable of?</b><br>
5. <b>Who is the third friend?</b><br>
6. <b>Is there redemption for Vira?</b><br>
7. <b>Who is Vira's faerie mistress? Is it Drakara?</b><br>
8. <b>Who is Baelia's friend from the journal entry? Is it Tavi or someone else?</b><br>
9. <b>Is Baelia even involved?</b><br>
10. <b>Is Jennumara involved?</b><br>
11. <b>Where is Kass?</b><br>
12. <b>Are The Three doing anything?</b><br>
13. <b>Is The Darkest Faerie involved or was that just a random plug for the Puzzle Hunters Club?</b><br>
14. <b>Are the other villains from Tales of Neovia involved?</b><br>
15. <b>What is the Lyre?</b><br>
16. <b>Will Orion ever find that spark to produce strong visions again?</b><br>
17. <b>What's the Faellie's name, if not Zizi?</b><br>
18. <b>Why exactly is everyone turning Grey?</b><br>
19. <b>Could Kari become a full "fledged" Grey Faerie in time?</b><br>
20. <b>Has Chadley/Smile Withme been affected by the Void's eldritch power or something?</b><br>
21. <b>Why was "TROPHY" singled out in letters in the April 16th news?</b><br>
22. <b>What is that tentacle creature?</b><br>
23. <b>What is The Void?</b>

<br><br>

Until Monday, stay tuuuuuuned, stay strapped, and stay curious.


</li></ul><br><b>18th April, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li><a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2024-04-15">New Features</a> and social media tourism poster simulcast! On both the news and social media, we got a new poster. And it's a bigger resolution than ever so let's get into the dissection.

<p>
<b>Ever wonder what happens to all those Money Tree donations in Neopia Central? Why not stop by and find out for yourself? A trip to Neopia Central isn't complete without a quick visit to the Money Tree to pick up a souvenir!</b>
</p>
<center><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/neopiacentral-poster.png" width="300" border="0"></center>

<br><br>

But before we do, let's go over the other posters we've got on the site so far.

<br><br><b>1. Meridell, at </b> <a href="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/meridell-poster.png">https://images.neopets.com/images/nf/meridell-poster.png</a>
<br><b>2. Brightvale, at </b> <a href="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/brightvale-poster.png">https://images.neopets.com/images/nf/brightvale-poster.png</a>
<br><b>3. Neopia Central, at </b> <a href="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/neopiacentral-poster.png">https://images.neopets.com/images/nf/neopiacentral-poster.png</a>

<br><br>

So you'd think that if you took those land names (Meridell, Brightvale, Neopiacentral) and replaced them with other land names, you might be able to see the posters for other lands, right? Similar to how people went looking for Grey shopkeepers? How about <b>faerieland-poster.png</b>, is that a thing? No, not yet. We have checked all the lands we know, though, and found that there is ONE poster that hasn't been shared yet. You can swap out the land names yourself if you like, but not everyone likes spoilers. However, we're pretty sure it's gonna go down like this: Today we get the Neopia Central poster, tomorrow we get the other poster, it's a quiet weekend, and then on Monday the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a> starts. So we should be talking about that other poster by tomorrow anyway. 

<br><br>

For now let's talk about that Neopia Central poster. We got a lot of the usual. Creeping Greyness...

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nLlC3Bk.png" alt="Soggy cardboard?" title="Soggy cardboard?"></center>

<br><br>

Bizarre leering eyes...

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3fcGGVl.png" alt="Some malevolent, many-faced force?" title="Some malevolent, many-faced force?"></center>

<br><br>

Crumbling foundations and blocked up doors and windows....

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/L97H4TY.png" alt="Is it better be trapped in there than trapped out here?" title="Is it better be trapped in there than trapped out here?"></center>

<br><br>

...and the Balloon Carrier. But this time they seem to be... someone or something is nearby. Some shadowy figure reaches out.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wcUJ56r.png" alt="We will fight this thing together, buddy." title="We will fight this thing together, buddy."></center>

<br><br>

With the presence of this shadow, and how it looks like the shadow is reaching out and resting a hand on the Balloon Carrier's shoulder or something... it really seems like this Balloon Carrier is going through it. They may be in an emotionally vulnerable state right now. But can the shadow be trusted? Or will the shadow take advantage of the Yurble's vulnerabilities and lead them down a self-destructive path? Make them more miserable than ever??? Maybe this Yurble is the "third friend" that Vira and her faerie mistress are looking for. Some victim of their toxic negativity. But if that's the case, then that calls into further question whether or not this Balloon Carrier is also the Painter. What is going through the Balloon Carrier's mind right now? Did they not do this? And they're looking around like "Oh my goodness what's happening to the world I live in?" Or... does the fact that they happen to be sighted at every disaster mean that they are doing this thing? But maybe they've got cold feet about the atrocities they commit? In what order are these attacks happening? After 3 lands maybe the Painter/Balloon Carrier needs some reassurance that it's a Good Thing™ that the're attacking these nations like this? Maybe this shadow is like "Ignore your conscience, I will be your conscience. Ignore your feelings, you can't trust them."

<br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=kh2riku_3">KH2Riku_3</a> again brings up the possibility of this Balloon Carrier being the Plot Yurble. Because they seem to be a Yurble, and they find themselves in the middle of a plot. But perhaps most important? He is bursting with emotion. And so it's all the more meaningful that the emotionally vibrant Yurble, who is in every plot, should find himself in the plot that dulls your emotions. Especially if this plot is only kicking off proper (hub page, earnable points, etc.) AFTER the <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/colosseum/">Altador Cup</a>. Maybe the plot kicks off right as the Cup is having its closing ceremonies. We're all living it up in Altador, it's a big party (but with an edgy undercurrent because we're all aware that something in Orion's visions is going to come true someday soon), we're celebrating the latest conquerors of the Cup... and then BOOM!!! Evil gets us right between the eyes with the first volley of <b>The Void Within</b>. Altador is the first casualty, and the Yurble Janitor/Forefitor is part of it. The Yurble carrying a balloon even makes sense if he started plotting right as the Cup ended. Maybe the balloon is one of the promotional Cup favors you see people with at big sporting events?

<br><br>

So if that is him you might wonder "So is Neostaff gonna change the images we see in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/hallofheroes.phtml?view_statue_id=6">Altador Mini Plot</a>? That sounds like a lotta work." But maybe that's not necessary. Because the punchline behind the Yurble Forefitor/Plot Yurble is that he may or may not be the one guy. After all, the Altador Mini Plot was still open for completion when <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tfr/">The Faeries' Ruin</a> was going on, and this guy was in Brightvale being a librarian at the time.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/faerieland/tfr_fa61c26562/p4_e784d30682/yurble.png" alt="He's a little redder than the one in Altador though, maybe?" title="He's a little redder than the one in Altador though, maybe?"></center>

<br><br>

Same guy as the Yurble Janitor? If so, how can he be in two places at once? In the end, it doesn't really matter and is probably part of the joke. But you know who else it might be? The Tax Beast, who is very Yurble-shaped.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/tcg/cotd_ice/0054_RV06.gif" alt="Tax Beast, original recipe" title="Tax Beast, original recipe"></center>
<br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/tcg/cotd_dfaerie/0035_RV01.gif" alt="Tax Beast, extra spicy recipe" title="Tax Beast, extra spicy recipe"></center>

<br><br>

So Yurble-shaped is he, that the Halloween Yurble emulates him.

<br><center><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/xo8h72hr/1/4.png" alt="Yurble are to Tax Beasts as Chias are to Flossets, apparently." title="Yurble are to Tax Beasts as Chias are to Flossets, apparently."></center>

<br>

Thing is, the Tax Beast doesn't have those spiral ears that Yurbles have. And this Balloon Carrier looks to have very round ears. As round as only a Yurble might have. But ear shape is hard to place when it comes to mad scribblings. There's still the speculation that this might be a Kyrii. However, the idea that they might be Telos starts to lose standing if this Balloon Carrier is sad about the things they're looking at. Or sad in general. Telos seems like the kinda guy who would love to sow this kind of misery. Or at the very least be cool with it, Telos is a villain through and through! So if this IS a Kyrii, who might it be?

<br><br>

What if it's Tavi? 

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/neopedia/179_tavi_lock_game.gif" alt="Really pushing it as far as ear roundness." title="Really pushing it as far as ear roundness."></center>

<br><br>

What if Baelia's journal entry is an old one, but Tavi is ALSO Vira's and the faerie's new friend? Tavi might belong to two friend groups? And now that Tavi has fallen in with the wrong crowd, Baelia must rock up to the spot, no powers, no wings, just courage and compassion, and save her friend and the world from an evil unprecedented? Whoever the Balloon Carrier is, we have a clear pattern now with them always showing up where these disasters are striking. And they do seem sad. They're here for every Greying, and they don't seem very happy about what they're looking at.

<br><br>

There's plenty unique to Neopia Central though. Look what they've done to the Food Shop! Icon of the Neopia Central skyline!

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sAy2oAE.png" width="450" alt="Imagine a hamburger that could eat YOU!" title="Imagine a hamburger that could eat YOU!"><br><br>

Imagine seeing that while you're headed down the street! The building itself now has a creepy face! Castles Meridell &amp; Brightvale didn't have that. Can this curse make buildings come to life and be evil? And speaking of creepy faces, while the other lands have creepy faces, this one has some of them with scribbles through them.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7CK1I2m.png" width="450" alt="Maybe the open mouths were throwing the concept off?" title="Maybe the open mouths were throwing the concept off?"><br><br>

Does that mean anything? Were these... faces... defeated by something? Whose side are these faces on? Are they good faces defeated by the curse? Or are they faces of the curse, defeated by those defending Neopia? Or are the scribbles just feedback, a byproduct of this twisted vision of what will be? A byproduct of this fuzzy interpretation?

<br><br>

In a plot about feelings, faces are gonna be a driving theme. Let's have a look at the Money Tree's face.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/drplZml.png" width="450" alt="Scamanders, take warning." title="Scamanders, take warning."><br><br>

This is also a step further than Meridell or Brightvale, because the Money Tree is a sentient being. So, does this mean sentient beings can be changed by the curse? In more ways than just turning Grey? Do you turn weird and evil thanks to the curse? Is this even the curse? Because this seems to be caused by the Paint Brush. Did Ellia, Breadmaster, Hubert, Inah, the Grooming Parlour Usul, and Kari all get painted by this Paint Brush and forget that it happened? That could be a side effect of the Paint Brush. Or it could be that  the Grey Curse and the Paint Brush Paint are two different things. We'll probably know if the Money Tree turns Grey. If the Money Tree turns Grey and is also projected to turn into whatever this is, that probably means the other Greyed Neopians are doomed to undergo the same.

<br><br>

Rainbow Pool is now viscous and oozy enough to leave a trail as you leave it. And look at that, more eyes in the water. Just like in Brightvale.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JZ9OCJh.png" width="450" alt="Where once there was vibrant color, there are now none." title="Where once there was vibrant color, there are now none."><br><br>

While we're in the area, what's this stuff between the Pool and the Tree?

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qUUi49o.png" alt="The dead are even showing up for this plot." title="The dead are even showing up for this plot."></center>

<br><br>

We can see another bone sticking out of the ground, but what's that stuff nearby? It looks jagged, could it be bone fragments? Kinda early in the season for them to be leaves. Or maybe it's assorted Money Tree donations? Seen through the lens of whatever is showing us these visions? And then there's this whatnot around the base of the Money Tree.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/m4pjsBi.png" alt="Best to just cut it and let it regrow." title="Best to just cut it and let it regrow."></center>

<br><br>

Just vague paint stains? If this graffiti is the product of a Paint Brush, and the once-Rainbow Pool is nearby, maybe the Painter came by to dip the brush and... that's this. Or maybe they're tracks? Footprints? These right here are definitely footprints...

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9JRFxZK.png" alt="Rally the sniffer Doglefoxes!" title="Rally the sniffer Doglefoxes!"></center>

<br><br>

No clue quite like footprints. Footprints, fingerprints, there's nothing more "cluey." Nothing else says "Notice this, ponder it" like a literal trail to follow. So, what might it mean? Footprints, leading up to the bank. Are they the prints of our Painter? Does the shape of the prints matter? Because they look like they might be Yurble feet. So... did this person walk up this path, to the Bank, and then begin their painting onslaught_  Maybe stop off at the Rainbow Pool, and then go sit on the roof of the NC Mall?

<br><br>

Hard to get a full picture of the proceedings if we don't know where these footprints started. If we don't follow them to their origin. Maybe this thing in front of the Bank will add more context to these footprints?

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/oQZEopI.png" alt="Well, whatever it is, it's not another skull." title="Well, whatever it is, it's not another skull."></center>

<br><br>

In addition to being an abstract sketch/scribble, it appears to have been scribbled over. Which is another thing maybe to take notice of: Of the 3 lands hit, Neopia Central is the only one where the graffiti itself has been scribbled over. Not just what was there originally. Maybe this is some kind of tetraptych? It looks flat, like a canvas or series of canvases. That maybe had paintings on them already. And the artist, whoever brought this nightmare to Neopia Central, was unhappy with the first draft so they scrapped it? How deep into the art/painting metaphors are we going? Could this Painter in fact be an actual regular ol' artist, jilted by a competitive industry? And at their lowest, Vira and the faerie reached out and said "Let's make a world where we can all thrive?" Then one thing led to another and the hamburgers turned into drooling monsters?

<br><br>

Y'know what they say though... art reflects the artist. Maybe all this stuff is reality warping to match the warped vision of a Painter who is damaged on the inside? And that's why the Balloon Carrier looks so sad? The Balloon Carrier is the Painter, and it is their sadness that comes through in their art, and makes the world into this horrible place? Just abstract, random darkness meant to show you how the Painter/Balloon Carrier feels in the form of visuals? Give or take some rough drafts that were scribbled out, hence the scratched out faces and whatever that thing is in front of the bank?</li>

<br><br><li>Speaking of art, a revisitation to our April 14th post. Why were those TDF sketches posted? Were they plot related? Well, something finally came to our attention. Names have been omitted to protect the innocent. Other names have been left in to NOT protect the NOT innocent.

<br><br>

So, was that post just part of the Puzzle Hunters Club and their original investigation into that new avatar? Did it have nothing to do with the plot? If so, it's easy enough to dismiss this and let other people go sniffing around for more avatar clues. Maybe somewhere in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/archives.phtml?archivist=1&amp;examine_book=1">Book of Ages</a>. But with the Puzzle Hunters Club now also spearheading the Darigan Citadel raid, it might be more apt to call them the people to call when ANYTHING needs investigating. Whenever there's a clue or a puzzle or something to think about. So this could still be plot relevant. Like the word "trophy" though, it's anyone's guess as to what it might mean. All we can do for now is keep these things in mind and wait for signs that match up with it. Because nothing seems to have changed in the Book of Ages, anyway.</li>

But the <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2024-04-15">New Features</a> has caught up to yesterday's Brightvale poster. No Baelia diary or TDF sketches, though.

<br><br>

This poster is the same poster they shared across social media. But here's an interesting thing <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=neoryuuko">Neoryuuko</a> noticed: The Meridell posters are slightly different. In that only one has any creeping Grey.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4KWPaVi.png" width="450" alt="The social media original" title="The social media original"><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/meridell-poster.png" width="450" alt="The one from the New Features" title="The one from the New Features"><br><br>

Minor oversight? Or does it meeeaaaan something??? <img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/oh.gif"> Like maybe something about the timing of the crises to hit the region? Maybe Greyness hits Brightvale first, and the Void takes a bit longer to turn Meridell Grey?

<br><br>

Just something else to remember when the Void is upon us. Don't forget! <b>T-R-O-P-H-Y!</b></li></ul><br><b>16th April, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li><a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2024-04-15">New Features</a> is up. But it's only just now gotten around to reporting on the Meridell poster.

<br><br><p><b>Greetings, adventurers! Have you explored Meridell yet? Pay a visit to landmarks such as the Mysterious Symol Hole, tour the majestic castle of King Skarl, pick some veggies at one of the local rustic farms, or simply soak in the natural beauty of Illusen's Glade!</b></p>
<br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/meridell-poster.png" width="300" border="0"></center>

<br><br>

Whereas over on the Neopets Facebook page (and X, and Instagram), we've already moved on to Brightvale.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/oDgXK12.png" width="450" alt="Rain or shine, Roberta's always a familiar sight at Brightvale's Scrollery.

Oh, the indignity!"><br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=163106754">Board 7</a> is once again pondering what will be. Let's follow the discussion. As with Meridell, we see Greyness spreading, walls crumbling, and the gates blocked by shadow.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UQTMrAt.png" alt="Having your kingdom left in ruin isn't as easy as Meridell makes it look." title="Having your kingdom left in ruin isn't as easy as Meridell makes it look."></center>

<br><br>

Also like in Meridell, we have our furry friend with the balloon!

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Pw3Gope.png" alt="Smaller this time, but unmistakable." title="Smaller this time, but unmistakable."></center>

<br><br>

With this Dullvale poster, it's even easier to believe now that yes, this is an artist's rendition of what the painter in Nyx's vision was doing. If that's so, could our furry friend with the balloon be our painter? To that you might say "Why the balloon, though? The painter was carrying a Paint Brush, not a balloon." But that's the thing about these posters. If this IS a representation of what Nyx saw in Brightvale, then it's just that: A representation. Because it already doesn't match up identically to what Nyx saw, so it's not an exact recreation, but a symbolic interpretation. Like the scrawlings of a madman who became aware of some eldritch truth. So maybe the sad balloon is just a "metaphor" for the Paint Brush. A visual representation of what can't be seen at face value.

<br><br>

But if this balloon carrying person IS the Painter, what does that mean as far as speculation that he might be Telos? Telos is a Kyrii. Could this be a Kyrii? Hmmm... the ears are pretty round, though. Like a Yurble's ears. Might be the more solid money to bet on the 'pet with the balloon being a Yurble. So let's consider the other possibility: Is the 'pet Nyx sees in the vision a Yurble?

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/l5IGZNB.png" alt="Long haired, that's for sure." title="Long haired, that's for sure."></center>

<br><br>

Can't really tell. But y'know what else? Telos is a shapeshifter, he can be whatever suits his whims. Then again... sometimes a balloon is just a balloon. Why bring one to Brightvale? Who is this balloon-carrying probably-Yurble? We don't know. Whoever they are, they seem to be enjoying some time by the moat. And speaking of the moat...

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/V1vzXtl.png" alt="The void isn't water soluble." title="The void isn't water soluble."></center>

<br><br>

Void scribbles have found their way into them. And if you look closely, you should see a pair of eyes looking up from the inky blackness. The "nothingness" as one Shadow Usul storyteller might describe it. Spreading Greyness, eyes that show certain emotions... someone with a balloon... these are all things Brightvale's poster has in common with Meridell's.

<br><br>

Know what it doesn't have in common? That purple haze. That was only in Meridell. So maybe it was part of the original poster? Not a clue or anything? What probably is of relevence that didn't happen in Meridell, though? The flags have been blackened.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yAXZMe3.png" alt="A black flag means death!" title="A black flag means death!"></center>

<br><br>

People like <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=ellebasi_de">Ellebasi_De</a> think they see the images of Paint Brushes left on some of these flags.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NWzL2zj.png" alt="In case you needed more signs that a Paint Brush was behind all this..." title="In case you needed more signs that a Paint Brush was behind all this..."></center>

<br><br>

These flags were not just scribbled over with Void. Some kind of hole has been punched through each. Holes many would say are "Paint Brush shaped." And what are those flowers on the path up to the drawbridge? Shadowy hands and whatnot, that's easy enough to come to terms with. But these flowers, that's just confusing. Unless there's a reason why behind those flowers that we'll come to understand, it sounds like these Void scribbles are just random weirdness. Flowers sprouting randomly in a battlefield. Random, unknowable chaos. What could be more eldritch than that? And speaking of things we don't understand, what is that on the grass?

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tn5dYYZ.png" alt="Some round thing in the ground?" title="Some round thing in the ground?"></center>

<br><br>

Perhaps a wheel of cheese? But <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/cheeseroller.phtml">Cheeseroller</a> is a Meridell thing. That cheese would've had to roll pretty far. Is that a Snowbunny ear we see, perhaps? Hidden by most of the round shape? Is this thing a Snowbunny? Or... is it a skull? Maybe looking up from the ground? Its left eye and nasal cavity obscured a little bit by the ground? And a big hole in the forehead? Because this right here is definitely a skull.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Os6USDA.png" alt="Skulls, bones, black flags... is this Brightvale or Krawk Island?" title="Skulls, bones, black flags... is this Brightvale or Krawk Island?"></center>

<br><br>

A skull with a femur bone sticking out of the ground. Remains of the dead? But... who are they that lie dead here??? Or if it's metaphorical, what do the skulls and bones symbolize? Skulls and bones almost never mean anything good... <img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/unsure.gif"><br><br>

In closing, Brightvale's got just about everything Meridell has, but Brightvale has skulls and flowers. Grave symbolism indeed. But there's more to this post than a picture. There's also the caption: <b>Rain or shine, Roberta's always a familiar sight at Brightvale's Scrollery. Need an ancient text deciphered or a dark, evil faerie vanquished? Plan a trip to erudite Brightvale today. You might just learn something!</b> Unlike the Meridell caption which reads like your typical tourism blurb, mentioning a variety of landmarks and outings, Brightvale only mentions Roberta and her <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=78">Scrollery</a>. So... will Roberta feature prominently in the plot as a whole? Maybe around the time Brightvale gets hit? In just about every plot, a common weapon sought and used against evil is knowledge. Research into old written word. Brightvale does have a book store too, but scrolls aren't just books, they're weapons. Also? Roberta isn't just a magic princess, she's a shopkeeper. So maybe she's going to turn Grey like some of the others? Of what significance is Roberta?

<br><br>

One poster for Meridell, another for Brightvale. This being a globetrotting adventure, you might assume there are more posters to come. And hopefully, from them, more clues to clean in the Void scribbles. But with all this focus on Meridell and Brightvale and Darigan Citadel, you might also assume that in this globetrotting adventure, the medieval realm is the one that gets hit the most/hardest. For now, all we can do is wait for the next post. Or poster. Whichever comes first.

<br><br><b><i>Long ago, I took on this form. My powers were taken, but I went on and continued. It's not been easy, and I know that something irreplaceable was taken from me.</i></b>

<br><br><b><i>Darkness lurks in my mind and makes my heart ache. I have met a new friend. Looking inside, gaining hopeful thoughts.</i></b>

<br><br><b><i>Baelia</i></b>

<br><br>

A journal entry from Baelia, up until now unseen by us. She talks about how turning Grey has left her feeling powerless. Darkness lurks in her mind and makes her heart ache. Gee, almost like there's a "Void Within" her??? Ahhhh??? At this point, maybe the question of what <b>The Void Within</b> in question is is a small-minded one. Maybe it works on multiple levels. The Void is a place you go, but "the void" is also a name for a thing inside you that drains you and makes you Grey.

<br><br>

Does this mean Baelia is the central faerie to this plot? Or is this plot big enough for both Nomi and Baelia? And Telos? And how long ago was this journal written? She says "Long ago, I took on this form," which calls things into question. How long had she been Grey by the time her <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=179">Neopedia</a> story happened? And while we're giving things a second thought, was Jennumara even the one who Greyed her? Maybe Baelia was Grey long before Jennumara captured her. Maybe Jennumara is unrelated to her turning Grey and Jennumara just happened to need a Grey Faerie and Baelia was around so she captured her? This is importat because the timing determines who her "new friend" likely is. If Baelia had been Grey for a while before Tavi found her? Then her "new friend" is probably Tavi and this journal entry was written shortly after they ventured out to get her a new name, or whatever. If they even decided to do that.

<br><br>

But over on <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=163104371">Board 7</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=nguyeplm">Nguyeplm</a> posits that it might be the other way around. Maybe Tavi isn't the "new friend" and this journal entry was written more recently than that. But who might this new friend be? Recall that Vira and her faerie mistress are looking for a third friend. Could she be that third friend? Could Baelia be somehow manipulated into becoming a villain? Vira was, after all. Promised something and was misled into corruption. But if this is the case, then that probably means Vira's faerie mistress is not the one that turned Baelia Grey. And her Grey transformation was not like Vira's. Baelia wasn't Greyed thanks to being led astray by dark temptation like Vira was. It would mean that she, right now, is about to be led astray by dark temptation. Maybe to cure her Greyness. We still don't know what it means for her to get a new name.

<br><br>

And then there's that last sentence in the entry. "Looking inside, gaining hopeful thoughts." Does that sound like its meant to be an acronym to you? Over on Jellyneo it definitely does to Archangel11891.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gfz9SKJ.png" width="450" alt="The 1st letter of each word in the last line spells out LIGHT Seems significant. given the awkward phrasing" title="The 1st letter of each word in the last line spells out LIGHT Seems significant. given the awkward phrasing"><br><br><b>L</b>ooking <b>i</b>nside, <b>g</b>aining <b>h</b>opeful <b>t</b>houghts." <b>Light</b>. It reads like a positive affirmation. Something your psychiatrist might tell you to keep in mind. Especially as the rumor is that Baelia, before she was Grey, was a Light Faerie. Per the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=979">Editorial</a> of Issue 979. And Nomi was a Light Faerie too. Maybe only Light Faeries can be fully Greyed? How would that even work for a Water Faerie?

<br><br>

Kari still has her wings so maybe she can't be fully Greyed. But she is Greying and probably in no state to host the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a>, which has not yet started. This looks like a job for Topsi. Did they finish patching him up? Someone's gotta host this thing.

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neggfest/y23/np/topsi3.png" width="450" alt="He said he would be back..." title="He said he would be back..."></li>

<br><br><p><b><i>Important Announcemen:</i> We know that many have been woried about Kari recently and what her change in appearance may mean for the Festival of Neggs. So we are here to infrm you there's no need to fear because Kari will still be holding the event!!!

<br><br>

Now there's probably a few things that occurred to you when you read that. First, that the Festival of Neggs will be happening on April 22nd. The latest ever. But these are extenuating conditions. The hostess is Greying, and Topsi and Neggistential haven't been heard from in a while. Where are they??? Second, that Kari will be hosting despite going Greyish. Once again, our fellow Neopians find themselves in relatable straits. Can't call off work for every headache. Especially when you love what you do. In these trying times its good to still have things in the world you love, like festivals of egg-like fruit. And third? Something <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=neoryuuko">Neoryuuko</a> pointed out, there are quite a few typos in that message.

<br><br>

Exactly 6 typos. "Announcemen, woried, infrm, retty, er," and "da." Just an incredible mistake? No, if we didn't need more things to overthink. We've got a missing T, R, O, P, H, and a Y. <b>Trophy</b>. But what does it mean??? <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=163105148">Board 7</a> has some ideas.

<br><br>

If you've been helping the Puzzle Hunters with their avatar investigation, you might wonder if this is another clue for that. And even if it was, what are we supposed to do with this information? Check our <a href="//www.neopets.com/prizes.phtml">Trophy Cabinets</a>? In a world where Greyness is looking for like to snuff out, the glorious gold of trophies stands out. Or maybe it's a clue leading to the new avatar. Not really our department right now. But between that avatar investigation and this plot? A lot of letters have mysteriously gone missing or might be part of some acronym... it's easy to feel like you're going crazy. "Light" is a reference to Baelia maybe being a Light Faerie once upon a time? Sure. But why do we need to remember the word "trophy???" Instead, maybe just relax, and keep the word "trophy" in your back pocket. When the time comes for it to mean something, you'll know. You'll remember that you were supposed to remember that word. Maybe you'll need to know it when the Festival of Neggs starts?

<br><br>

In the meantime, there should be aplenty of social media posts to overthink.

When you think about it mathematically, how a bunch of Neopia Central shopkeepers and one Terror Mountain shopkeeper got Greyed, maybe you need some kind of missing link for that to happen. Kari is a worldly faerie, she's got her Festival and her Ice Caves Neggery. Maybe she was in Neopia Central, picked something up there, and took it back to Terror Mountain?

<br><br>

As for Neopets.com, there's nothing left to discover. As far as we can find, nothing else out of the ordinary happened today. Out of the ordinary for Grey Day, anyway. So, the immediate thing we're waiting on now is the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a>. Maybe tomorrow? Maybe later? Last year's Festival started on April 20th, the latest ever. So the Festival will probably start no later than that, right? But then again, we're dealing with <b>The Void Within</b>, which has roped the Festival itself in by turning Kari Grey. At one point we speculated "Maybe Baelia will be Kari's co-star for the Festival so that the theme of Greyness is covered!" Unable to comprehend a world where Kari herself might be Grey. This is maybe the most different, most special Festival of Neggs we've had since the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/y14/progress.phtml">Mysterious Negg Journey</a>. Maybe we can't rely on precedent.</li>

<br><br><li>The Void works hard, but the Neopets social media team works harder. Apparently they don't get weekends off because they continue to post even on Saturday and Sunday. And because we're in these plotly times, it's hard to dismiss these social media posts as not having some deeper meaning. Take this post from yesterday...

<br><br>

With that creepy Meridell post in mind, any and every social media post (without some Neopian holiday to explain it) COULD be meant to stoke the hype flames for <b>The Void Within</b>. A post about Baelia on Grey Day? That could just be because it's Grey Day. But why this Dark Faerie post on April 13th? Just an ordinary post? Does it need a reason? Or... does it absolutely have a reason and it totally has deeper, plot-relevant meaning?

<br><br><b>Besides the Darkest Faerie, there has only ever been ONE other Faerie banished for practising dark magic.</b> And then a wrench emoji. And then three sketches of said Darkest Faerie. What does it all mean? The wrench, that probably means Delina the Crafting Faerie. She who is... not seen that much lately, usually only shows up for Faerie Quest events.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/shh/event/crafting-faerie-1.png" alt="A Dark Faerie that's nice??? WHAT???" title="A Dark Faerie that's nice??? WHAT???"></center>

<br><br>

As for that other Dark Faerie who was banished, that's probably Jhudora, right? When you think of the biggest Dark Faerie threats to Neopia, once upon a time the two big names were Jhudora and TDF. But Jhudora has since kinda shed that reputation as Dark Faeries earn more sympathy and the world becomes more open minded. And was she really "banished?" The <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/darkfaerie.phtml">Bluff</a> isn't exactly smack dab in the heart of Faerie City, but it's still in Faerieland, right? Maybe she lives on the outskirts because she has to? Which would mean that this stuff about her deceiving the world into trusting her, that's totally not the case. If anything, the world is unfairly distrustful of her. Which seems to be the perspective we've been coming to lately.

<br><br>

Or maybe that other faerie isn't Jhudora. Maybe it's Vira's mistress. After all, if anybody's gonna be banished, it's gonna be the faerie that Fyora fears to such an extent that she dare not rain on Neopia's parade by hinting at the possibility of her being back in play. If "banishment" now encompasses things like how TDF was petrified. Whoever this mysterious faerie is, she's back from whatever was keeping her away. And from the looks of her wings, she's probably Dark.

<br><br>

Speaking of Dark Faeries/dark magic and that Meridell poster, another curiosity we forgot to point out the other day. Over by the mountains, what's that purple haze?

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EbquFB0.png" alt="The Misty Mountains..." title="The Misty Mountains..."></center>

<br><br>

Was that there originally? Without the original undefaced poster as a frame of reference, we can't know. Might it have something to do with the Greyness sweeping across the land? Or, is that where the <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/index_evil.phtml">Citadel</a> is usually parked? Maybe that dark energy is some Draconian/Dariganian sorcery? Especially if Kass is a central player in this. It would be Darigan Citadel's fight for sure. Maybe Darigan and his forces are swooping in to counterattack this voidly force? Or maybe that's close to where <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/earthfaerie.phtml">Illusen's Glade</a> is, and Jhudora sneaking over for a visit? If Jhudora is more hero than villain, maybe she's in Meridell doing her part to drive back the Greyness? Especially if someone dared to harm any of the pretty little red hairs on Illusen's head. If Jhudora ever becomes a hero, surely Illusen's safety will be what motivates her. Maybe she and Illusen are teamed up back to back a la Ylana and Sophix, holding down that region of Meridell like a dynamic duo.

With Neostaff posting to social media every day, it's almost like every day brings news for <b>The Void Within</b>. Or at least something to speculate on. Are we really gonna speculate wildly over every social media post Neostaff makes? We just might. Festival of Neggs could be happening any second now, things are too hot. Gotta keep your eyes open for anything and everything.

</li></ul><br><b>12th April, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>Things are really heating up, and a strong case is being made for keeping an eye on the Neopets social media platforms. Remember the cryptic Facebook posts Neostaff made back in 2013? Where they didn't SAY The Obelisk War was coming, but the posts were totally about the upcoming Obelisk War? Well get a load of this "totally innocuous" post that's "absolutely not a prelude to anything."

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mEZGpdu.png" width="450" alt="Greetings, adventurers! Have you explored Meridell yet?

What is this meant to be??? What is happening in Meridell??? <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=163098035">Board 7</a> is inquiring, as usual. While everyone's raiding Darigan Citadel, it looks like the real party is about to kick off in Meridell at some point soon. We see the surreal corruption of the kingdom through the medium of graffiti. The image is kinda big, so maybe you wanna open it up in a separate tab...

<br><br>

Sinister eyes in the upper right corner. Kinda evokes what we saw in the Void, right?

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Wov6XBO.png" alt="Evil eyes" title="Evil eyes"></center>

<br><br>

Most of them are angry, but one of them looks to be tearing up, like it's sad. And what is that lying amidst the eyes? Just under the first, biggest pair? Is that, like, a leathery wing? A spreading shadow? "Welcome" is scratched out too. That's a little less abstract, but still a puzzler. Perhaps an erasure of what's positive and loving? Or maybe a warning to stay out of Meridell. Or both? 

<br><br>

Down in the bottom right, some... indiscernible figure... holding a balloon with a face on it. People like <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=maslia">Maslia</a> are keen to point out how the face looks like a sad version of Smile Withme's mask.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/rvKTDMT.png" alt="Just let go?" title="Just let go?"></center>

<br><br>

Again, just because it happened on April Fool's Day doesn't mean it doesn't count. Who is Chadley REALLY working for??? And don't miss the greyness making its way across the land either. Mood/vibe seems to be an important theme here. But who or what is holding the balloon? Are those Yurble ears we see? If this plot is as big as people are thinking it might be, a "plot of plots" you might call it, maybe there should be at least one Yurble.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DTP8U1H.png" width="450" alt="Coming soon, Yurble Void Apostle." title="Coming soon, Yurble Void Apostle."></center>

<br><br>

And perhaps most ominous of all, the gates of Castle Meridell. Hands grasping, tendrils ensnaring. Whatever this force is didn't just "happen" to corrupt this place, it's reaching out and seeking out hosts to consume and destroy. It's consciously "coming to get us." The defenses of the castle crumble under its touch.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8thL16W.png" alt="What happens to the people still inside?" title="What happens to the people still inside?"></center>

<br><br>

With all this going on in Meridell, one might think back to Orion's vision, where we saw Brightvale. Maybe that warrants a second look?

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yChMZmI.png" width="450" alt="Coming soon to YOUR neighborhood???" title="Coming soon to YOUR neighborhood???"><br><br>

Shadows on the gates of Castle Brightvale, similar to the ones at Castle Meridell. One recalls Hanso's words in Chapter 7 of <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tfr/comic.phtml?chapter=7">The Faeries' Ruin</a>: "It looks like everything was painted with a giant Grey Paint Brush." That Paint Brush, the suspected centerpiece weapon of the villains who are coming after us, did it paint those hands on the Castle Meridell gates? This plot will have leaders from around Neopia responding, does that mean they'll be responding to direct attacks like this one? Will Skarl and Meridell be brought into this plot specifically because our enemies will draw first blood? And will our villains be hitting multiple targets like this? With this very Paint Brush??? 

<br><br>

But with Kass and Darigan Citadel a focal point of speculation, coupled with these visions of bizarre versions of Meridell and Brightvale, maybe the medieval region is ground zero for where this is all gonna kick off. The medieval region, stomping ground of The Three. And... let's have a closer look at the back of our enigmatic painter's head. Lotta party in the back. A mane that long, could this person be a Kyrii? Like Telos likes to be???

<br><br>

Grey Day is April 14th. That's this Sunday. All this Greyness and these byproducts of Greyness, surely fate should hold things in store for the day itself? Maybe on Monday because it's a weekend. Or maybe evil will sneak up on us on Sunday anyway, when there's no Neostaff around to keep us informed?

Have you been following the Puzzle Hunters Club mystery on the Neopets social media platforms? Did you even know it was going on? 

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GBhsP8d.png" width="450" alt="Birdie Featherhart, Max Torra, and Maeve Slade." title="Birdie Featherhart, Max Torra, and Maeve Slade."><br><br>

Birdie, Max, and Maeve are suspending the avatar search to address developments in <b>The Void Within</b>. These three are some of Neopia's sharpest investigative minds, and are savvy to the knowledge that Kass's sword was seen in Orion's visions. For this, they are spearheading a raid on Darigan Citadel. And they want YOU to suit up for it. Over on the Neopets Facebook page.

To this you might say "I got 50 dollars, I think I'll pass." But even if you don't participate in the raid, you should keep an eye on the Neopets Facebook page.

Like Chadley, people are taking action. And you can too. 

</li></ul><br><b>8th April, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>If you've seen the <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Camont">leaked shopkeeper images</a>, today is a surprising day for you. We got a 5th Grey shopkeeper today, but it's not one anyone was expecting...

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7vM7qYw.png" width="450" alt="Would a Paint Brush work on a faerie regardless?" title="Would a Paint Brush work on a faerie regardless?"><br><br>

It's not a "shop" like most people were thinking, but the <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/neggery.phtml">Neggery</a> is technically a shop. Kari herself is now a Grey Faerie. Or "Greying," anyway. She still has her wings, but they're looking a little flaccid.

<br><br>

That's big news on its own, but in order to TRULY appreciate this development, you need to be up to speed on all the discoveries and investigations. A while back we mentioned that a total of five shopkeepers were projected to turn Grey, discovered after going through all the images that could be found from <b>w1.gif</b> to <b>w117.gif</b>. <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=4">Ellia</a> was the first. 3 business days later (that's days not counting the weekend), the <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=5">Grooming Parlour Usul</a> turned Grey. Another 3 and it was <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=15">Breadmaster</a>. Another 3 and it was <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=46">Hubert</a>. And so a pattern emerged with one shopkeeper left: In 3 more business days from March 29th (that being April 3rd), we were supposed to get our fifth and final discovered Grey shopkeeper: Inah from <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=37">Super Happy Icy Fun Snow Shop</a>.

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/plots/tvw/images/shopkeepers/w37.gif" alt="A look at what hasn't happened." title="A look at what hasn't happened."><br><br>

So why show you this when it hasn't happened yet? Because we were probably meant to see it. Neostaff knew that we knew about the five shopkeepers we were expecting to see. Neostaff established a pattern of a new Grey shopkeeper every 3 business days. So when April 3rd came, they wanted us to be like "Why haven't we gotten Grey Inah yet?" They wanted us distracted by what we thought we knew. Waiting, expecting Inah. Coming up with ideas for why she hadn't shown up yet. They wanted our guard down. So they could drop not just any new Grey shopkeeper on us, but a new Grey Faerie of all things. Inah may very well turn Grey at some point for real, but for establishing and then breaking a pattern we were all following, she served as an effective red herring. A "Grey Herring," you might say.</li>

<br><br><li>Speaking of tricks, an issue from our Corrections Department: Apparently all that stuff on April Fool's Day? That was a joke for April Fool's Day.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/eHpHxnj.png" width="450" alt="Won't get Fooled again." title="Won't get Fooled again."><br><br>

But just because it was an April Fool's gag doesn't mean it isn't canon. Gnorbus were an April Fool's gag. So don't be too quick to dismiss it, especially as it directly addressed developments regarding <b>The Void Within</b>. When next we hear from Chadley he's got Smile Withme allegations to defend.</li>

<br><br><li>So, Kari is now Greying. <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=163090172">Board 7</a> is abuzz. Our essential Neopian workers are all appreciated, but you'd be forgiven for feeling more of an impact with Kari turning Grey. An icon of the brand, for one. For her to stop being a Negg Faerie and start being a Grey Faerie would be what they call a "world-altering event." For two, the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a> is coming up soon, and she hosts it most of the time. This development must logically lead into that, making this upcoming Festival even more plot-relevant than it already was going to be. And third? She's a faerie. And <b>The Void Within</b> is supposed to be about a faerie. All this Greyness made it seem like Baelia was a lock because she was our first and most iconic Grey Faerie. But now Kari is becoming a Grey Faerie, and she was Greyed by the very developments of this plot. Maybe this plot is about her?

<br><br>

But what about that stuff about "long overdue for a resolution" and "not featured enough?" Kari gets her own Festival every year. Well, y'know who <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=ramblingrose4">RamblingRose4</a> would like to hear from someday? Nomi. "The Other Grey Faerie." Introduced in <b>The Grey Faerie Chronicles: Nomi's Quest</b>, released April 22nd, 2008 as the first in a cut short series of books that may or may not be canon.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/shopping/books/grey_faerie/nomisquest_int_pg_0.png" alt="She turns Grey in the story." title="She turns Grey in the story."></center>

<br><br>

When it comes to characters that haven't been featured very much, it's hard to beat the ones that come from retired merchandise. The ones that only ever got to be in the retired merchandise they came from. There were likely going to be more stories in the Grey Faerie Chronicles, but moving merch is tough. Especially in 2008. Nomi basically disappeared after the book deal dried up. 

<br><br>

And as for stories overdue for a resolution? You can read Nomi's <a href="//www.neopets.com/shopping/books/greyfaerie/nomisquest.phtml">here</a> for absolutely free. Not a story many have read. RamblingRose4 has though. Way it goes is, Nomi was a young faerie apprentice living in Faerie City with her Faellie Zizi. Again, her <b>FAELLIE</b> Zizi. Anyway, Nomi was looking to stand a little taller amongst her peers, magic-wise. She overheard a conversation that Light Faeries (she was supposedly a Light Faerie before turning Grey, though you don't see very many bluish purple Light Faeries) can receive incredible power in exchange for doing a quest for <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/witchtower.phtml">Edna</a>. The irony of a faerie doing a quest for a Neopet should not be lost on you. In secret, she heads out for the Haunted Woods to pick up work from Edna. But while on the quest, she falls prey to Balthazar. And his client, a shapeshifting sorceror named Telos.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/shopping/books/grey_faerie/nomisquest_int_pg_73.png" alt="Somewhat outdated design for Balthazar." title="Somewhat outdated design for Balthazar."></center>

<br><br>

Telos appears to be a Kyrii, but is there such thing as a "true" physical form when it comes to shapeshifters? Telos is gathering faerie essence for his mysterious mistress. Again, his <b>MYSTERIOUS MISTRESS</b>. His words: <b>I am very much hoping your faerie essence will match my mistress's. Then she'll be able to absorb it and perform her own magic once again. She must have all her strength back to carry out the grand plan.</b> With a spell, he takes her power and makes her Grey. And with another spell he takes her memory. Calling himself "Master of Memory Thieves."

<br><br>

Stuck in her jar, Nomi is left behind by Telos while he goes to complete an unspecified errand. She has no memory of who she is or where she came from or how she ended up in a jar. In time, she is found by two Neovian Xweetoks named Paxi and Rex. The three of them go through her belongings and are able to determine her name. But they still don't know where she's from. So they go to see their other friend, a Korbat named Ullia. Being knowledgeable, Ullia is aware of someone going around stealing faerie juice and holding Grey Faeries. Holding them "somewhere." Upon seeing Nomi's Greyness, Ullia brings this up and makes our traveling party aware that someone is most likely after Nomi. So they set out to seek counsel from the <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/braintree.phtml">Brain Tree</a>, the world's smartest tree. Through whatever his means, he should be able to tell them where Nomi is from. Now, players on Neopets.com have to complete an <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/esophagor.phtml">Esophagor Quest</a> to complete a Brain Tree Quest. But Nomi was able to satisfy his terms simply by answering a riddle correctly: "What was given to you, belongs to only you, but is used by your friends more than yourself?" The answer, turns out, is a name. Names are a running literary theme when it comes to Grey Faeries. They give him the answer he seeks, and he gives them the answer they seek. Their bodies spent from traversing the Woods all night, they rest in the relative safety of the dawn. When they wake, they will set out for Faerieland.

<br><br>

And... that's the end. Nomi's story is about as "resolved" as Baelia's, if not less so. We've heard from Baelia over the years. Baelia even had a role to play in <a href="//www.neopets.com/twr/">The Wraith Resurgence</a>. Nomi did not. We don't know how <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tfr/">The Faeries' Ruin</a> affected her, if at all. Her Faellie Zizi was left behind in Faerie City while Nomi went on this quest. What if Nomi never made it back home? What if Zizi was then adopted by Nyx? You'll remember from <b>Neopets Live: The Void Within Edition</b> that <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop</a> specifically omitted the Faellie's name. Now, the Faellie in the story appears to be a girl and Nyx's Faellie, per the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=1000">Editorial</a> of <b>Neopian Times Issue 1000</b>, appears to be a boy. But people misspeak, this is a small issue. What we've also got is a Kyrii in service of a "mistress" collecting making faeries Grey and also probably collecting them. What if that Kyrii is the third ally? What if he and Vira have the same mistress? Would this mean he was the one who Greyed Baelia? If so, why did he target all those Neopets? Do they have energy his mistress can use?

<br><br>

RamblingRose4 might be in luck. But you know what? Signs point to this plot being the biggest ever. If you've read what Aesop has said in interviews, for instance, he says things like <b>We really want to have a world-altering event</b>. He says this plot is set to feature the major leaders of Neopia. The international community as a whole will be responding to this Voidly threat. So asking questions like "Who will the plot be about" might be reductive. This plot is so big, you could argue that it's about everyone. And maybe, just maybe, that'll include Nomi.

Mr. Withme has a remedy for the Greyness going around: Cultivating a positive outlook. These shopkeepers, have they tried NOT being Grey? To that you might say "Yes, didn't repainting not work?" And you'd be right to say that. But did they try motivational posters? Because we're trying them today. See, these shopkeepers are Grey down to their mood, even. So if you improve the mood, maybe you improve the color. And part of improving the mood is deciding that you WILL have energy, you WILL have motivation, you WILL NOT take depression for an answer.

You could admire these posters, but it's hard to live in service of their message when they stand in the way of you doing anything. You might clear 'em away so you can get around Neopia. Doing this might arouse the attention of Mr. Withme.

Maybe getting out in the sun would help beat whatever this Grey Curse is? Out in the Vitamin D? They're looking pale, right? Vitamin D is supposed to help with that.

<br><br>

But maybe you're not getting any color from the sun. Smile has other ideas to supplement the motivational poster therapy.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ObpymCO.png" width="450" alt="Hey there! Still not feeling better? Oh, what's that? You think we should try to discover what may be the underlying systematic issue that is causing everyone to be so sad? Nah, that couldn't possibly work. I know, why don't you try drinking some cold water? That should perk you right up! And, of course, don't forget to check out more of my posters and just keep smiling!" title="Hey there!

Maybe insufficient hydration IS an underlying systematic issue? How much water per day do YOU drink?

<br><br>

But if the motivational posters still aren't inspiring enough, Smileman has another solution up his sleeve.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HrbM32Q.png" width="450" alt="Okay, okay, I can admit when I'm wrong. Maybe the posters alone won't fully fix everything. I've got another great idea, though!

Don't you trust me?" title="Okay, okay, I can admit when I'm wrong. Maybe the posters alone won't fully fix everything. I've got another great idea, though!

There's a saying when it comes to goods and services offered for free: If you're not paying for the product, then it's an absolute steal and you can't afford NOT to take advantage of the offer.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/j2kYx3O.png" width="450" alt="For the low-low price of loyalty and admiration, you can smile all your cares away with a simple sign of this here contract.

But maybe you're not ready to sign right away. Maybe you're like "What's with the Zalgo text around 'loyalty and admiration?'" Mr. Withme will strongly suggest that you take the offer.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fHel9r8.png" width="450" alt="Oh, hey, friend, you almost accidentally chose the wrong option! No need to panic; I know you want to sign!

Or maybe the brain fog of Grey Sickness has blunted your focus. Smile Withme will help you come to a decision.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mHHWP4Z.png" width="450" alt="Oops, another accident, huh? That's alright; I know it can be hard to focus when you're down in the dumps. It's going to be okay.

Suddenly, the contract vanishes... in a puff of smoke??? And in it's place is this <b>Smile Withme Mask</b>.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FW4aXFt.png" width="450" alt="The contract disappears in a puff of smoke.... and you are left holding this.

As soon as you accept the mask, you should notice your perspectives on life change immediately.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/u88h4TE.png" width="450" alt="Is this not what you wanted? Well, it technically fulfils the contract. With this, you can smile forever and ever and ever!

And because the old posters didn't work, Smile Withme has swapped them out for new posters that approach motivation from a different angle. Direct opposites of the old posters.

<br><br>

But if you refuse even these posters, Smile Withme vows to never be a memory. To follow you always, to defend you from the darkness that plagues the world in these Grey times.

You also get this dazzling avatar, to defend against bad vibes on the Neoboards.

<br><br>

The mask is wearable, but <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=orisasda">Orisasda</a> finds that you can play around with the mask noncommittally. Instead of putting the mask on outright.

Most Charming Smile winner and Best Hair nominee, <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=293">Chadrick "Chadley" Woolsworth Tuffington IV</a> is the one drawing first blood against <b>The Void Within</b>. Whatever name he goes by, he has always had a knack for gathering fans and starting movements. This one appears to be the latest, and all you gotta do to join the fight against The Void is put on the mask. The mask appears to have some power to it, what can the tentacle creature do against such bright smiles?

<br><br>

Festival of Neggs is next, maybe we'll see Orion and Reina and even Fyora wearing the mask?

</li></ul><br><b>29th March, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>Yep, looks like 3 business days.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LB5aTAS.png" width="450" alt="Lunch break rush ain't been what it used to." title="Lunch break rush ain't been what it used to."><br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=46">Hubert</a> is now cursed with Greyness. That's 4 out of 5, and if this pattern continues we should have our 5th and final (for now) shopkeeper Greyed up on April 3rd. It'll also be shortly after Easter, so maybe the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a> will kick off by then. Hopefully with an investigation into this Grey thing. How did they turn Grey? Can WE turn Grey? Is it contagious??? These shopkeepers are all so different, so random, that this curse seems like the kind of thing that could affect a broad variety of Neopians. 

<br><br>

For now it seems confined to Neopia Central. Maybe that'll be where our Festival is held this year. Here's hoping Topsi is alright. It's been a while since he's been heard from, and if <b>The Void Within</b> is as wide spanning as speculated, it would be a shame to not hear from him.

</li></ul><br><b>27th March, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>And that's a wrap! <b>Neopets LIVE - The Void Within</b> is in the books and boy do we have thoughts and feelings.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Gyl1m2l.png" width="450" alt="A code so obvious, people guessed it before the Live was over." title="A code so obvious, people guessed it before the Live was over."><br><br>

Let's break this beauty down piece by piece.

<br><br>

First, the pre-stream music is different. Usually the Neopets Live pre-stream music is the soundtrack from <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=379">Meepit Juice Break</a>. But today we got this spacey sort of music. Couldn't quite place the origin for a while, but thanks to the sharp ears of <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=coolman233312">CoolMan233312</a>, it has been identified as the "soundtrack" to <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=404">Kreludan Mining Corp</a>. Note: The song doesn't appear in the actual game, but it is listed and listenable as the Kreludan Mining Corp music on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/music.phtml">Neopets Music</a> page.

<br><br>

Now, why that song? Is it because this is going to be a spacey plot primarily and they needed a spacey sounding song with an eerie, mysterious sound to it? Did <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=536">Time Tunnel</a> not quite strike the right mood? Or maybe they used it because the song doesn't actually appear in the game and they want to give it actual purpose as theme music for <b>The Void Within</b>. Or... and this might really be stretching things, but maybe they meant the choice of the Kreludan Mining Corp music to be significant? Maybe Kreludan Mining Corp (the game, <a href="//www.neopets.com/moon/mining.phtml">the site</a>, etc.) are involved somehow? There was that speculation that our Aisha hero works for Kreludan Mining. That theory does seem to conflict with the significance of the Virtupets Delivery Pilot Training Manual though. But maybe Kreludan Mining is somehow associated with whatever our Aisha hero is delivering?

<br><br>

Early on in the stream we are introduced to writers room. The watchers from beyond, if you will: 

<br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop</a>, Narrative Director
<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_stone">Stone</a>, Senior Narrative Designer, mind behind <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieshope/">Faerie's Hope</a>, <b>Tales of Neovia</b>, and the one who introduced us to Orion
<br><b>Jewel</b>, Narrative Designer for the upcoming <b>Tales of Dacardia</b>
<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_fallie">Fallie</a> (not "Faellie"), Social Media Coordination Meepit

<br><br>

Our host Amanda kicks things off by asking about the Grey shopkeepers. At <b>13:59</b>, Aesop had this to say: <b>That's an interesting conundrum, isn't it? Yeah, I've seen quite a few Grey shopkeepers appearing across Neopia, and from the gossip I've heard, they seem to really be especially drained and feeling dismal after turning this mysterious Grey color. But despite the debilitating effect that accompanies it, the most unusual thing I've heard about this unique Grey color is that it seems no matter what any of the Neopians try, they can't be painted another color after they've been Greyed out.</b> Our first new confirmed fact of the stream: <b>The Paint Brushes do nothing to treat Greyness.</b> Interesting plot when it comes to color. But what we still don't know is <i>how</i> these shopkeepers turned Grey. There may very well be a <b>void within</b> them, but what put it there? What "developed" it?

<br><br>

Fallie is wise to the goings on in the Void. And so as a social media representative she's in the trenches with us, sharing in the speculation. Though she clearly knows way more than we do. And with this knowledge, at <b>16:44</b> she remarked <b>I'm super impressed already at how scarily... not "close" but, like, some of the theories that have come out I'm like "Oh my God, how did they get to this point?" So yeah, Neopians are sharp.</b> But then, how sharp are we if we aren't cutting it close? Is Fallie trying to say that we're overthinking things? Digging too deep for our own good? If so, maybe the least complex answers are the correct ones. Once again, Occam's Razor.

<br><br>

As far as narrative themes, at <b>19:36</b> Aesop describes this story as sort of a mirror or allegory for <b>stepping away from Neopia</b>, like for instance how you might go on hiatus for a while. Or quit indefinitely, only to find yourself drawn back thanks to nostalgia or lingering memories. And coming back after all that time can be overwhelming. Any time someone comes back, it's like "What'd I miss? What's happening now? What's been going on in Neopia while I was gone?" Aesop also adds <b>But also, in your time away from Neopia maybe you're stronger after your struggles, and hopefully you have something new to bring back.</b> Our Aisha and Faellie heroes arrived in this mysterious place, grappled with the tentacle creature, one of them learned hardware repair and the other seems to be able to open rifts in spacetime. Rifts that lead back home. A home that maybe you don't recognize right away. So, lining that up with the metaphor Aesop described, is The Void where you go when you leave Neopia? The obligated pull away from where you'd rather be? The Aisha and Faellie are basically Neopians who had to leave for a while and are now coming back? Like so many of us have? It'll be nice to see where all of our friends went that used to play.

<br><br>

On paper, the plot is brought to us by Aesop, Stone, Jewel, and probably Fallie. But at <b>23:11</b> Aesop explains <b>The plot is a shared effort, so we outlined it together. Not only the writers in this room, but actually we had completely different disciplines in there as well as art and programming. We just have some huge Neopets fans on staff that, like, regardless of whatever department they're from, they're also great storytellers who care a lot about the lore and the characters in the world. So it was really nice to just kinda have a larger brainstorming session with anyone who really wanted to be involved in the process from the team.</b> So in reality, this plot is driven by the input of the staff as a whole. So one wonders how many staffers actually know about what's happening behind the scenes with this plot. Dom says he doesn't know anything, was he not contacted?

<br><br>

There's the question of how long this crisis might last, remember how we were wondering when the plot had to start and how long it had to last so that it didn't conflict with the content schedule. But at <b>24:40</b> Aesop reveals just how heavy this is about to be: <b>I'll say now, we're planning for this plot to be spread out for almost an entire year, so at least around 10 months of content.</b> First thing you might ask is, does that count "time served?" When did the clock start on this 10 months of plot? Back during the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faeriefestival/index.phtml">Faerie Festival</a>? Because if not, this could be the plot to end all plots. Even with "delays," this would be a long runner. And potentially throws out the whole "They can't have this plot around Cup time or around the time of any important site events." Let's see... If the plot starts AFTER this year's Cup, and lasts for 10 months? Hmmmm... no wait the Cup might very well remain untouched. But everything else falls under the plot's shadow. As mentioned before, the longest a plot usually lasts is 3 months. Some people say <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/plot.phtml">Champions of Meridell</a> is the exception. But even if you wanna count every day from the day Champs started to the day it ended (despite it having delays/long stretches where nothing happened), that's still only 9 months. 10 months would be the longest ever plot.

<br><br>

Jewel is working on the plot, but her day job is the upcoming Tales of Dacardia. And at <b>27:22</b> she says <b>I'm also trying to figure out ways to connect the upcoming plot to Tales of Dacardia.</b> Which makes sense in an organic world. Major events should have an impact, leave a footprint. Things that happen around the world should reflect other events that happen, even if they aren't direct sequels. If two lands go to war, a third land should be like "Hey remember that time those two lands went to war?" Just by virtue of being a land in Neopia. The game is set to launch in April, if it can make that deadline there should be plenty of time for the game to reflect stuff happening on Neopets.com.

<br><br>

At <b>28:26</b>, it's time for what Amanda dubs "hints and clues." And as usual, Neostaff has a lot they can't say. As far as whether we as a community have missed any that have already been released? At <b>29:11</b> Stone says <b>I can't think of one.</b> That's to be expected. What about future clues and teasers and prologue? <b>There is something interesting planned that could be an interesting, like, continuation of some stuff we've seen. Or it might go for a while, and if you really wanna see it all from start to finish you'll wanna make sure to log in for future events. Such as, like, <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/colosseum/">Altador Cup</a> and other things like that. So make sure to log in to those.</b> Aesop touched on that before, stick around for events to get more prologue/teasers. But is Stone saying we might expect prologue/teasers from the Cup? The sacred Cup? Festival of Neggs has cutscenes and the like, it lends itself to story and bumps in the road. But the Cup? The Cup has Press Roll, and that's about it. How disruptive to the Cup might <b>The Void Within</b> end up being? If the plot proper starts after the Cup, maybe the Cup's ending is disrupted by the arrival of a Voidly enemy. A la <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/sfc/index.phtml?show=2">Spooky Food Eating Contest, Chapter 2</a>. And then we go straight into earning plot points?

<br><br>

But what about hints and clues we can have now? Amanda asks about the villains making wicked plans and Jewel chimes in at <b>31:25</b> saying <b>They are not entirely alone here</b> and <b>they may have even made a new friend</b>, recalling the proverb about <b>bad things coming in threes.</b> Now, this one works on a couple of of levels. First, at face value: Vira and her faerie mistress have recently met a new partner in crime. If this is a plot about Baelia, there's been that lingering question of how there can be room in this plot for Jennumara AND Drakara. Well, what if Vira's faerie mistress is one of those two, and their new friend is the other? Vira's faerie mistress is Drakara, and then Jennumara rocks up like "Hey what are you guys up to? Maybe I can help, maybe I have what you're looking for." But maybe "bad things coming in threes" is a reference to something else. Vira and her faerie mistress probably made at least one new friend. But you know what else is bad and comes in threes? THE Three. 

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/tcg/cotd_meri/0022_HS10.gif" alt="If faeries are from Paradise, where did this faerie come from?" title="If faeries are from Paradise, where did this faerie come from?"></center>

<br><br>

Maybe what Jewel means is that The Three are involved. Both things can be true, especially in a plot with 10 months of runtime. The Three are involved, but also Vira and her mistress meet a new friend. Maybe they form a coven of three, maybe they form a larger coven. Maybe their new friend isn't a faerie at all, but a Neopet? Two 'pets and a faerie? Like The Three are? It lines up thematically, it's like poetry. It rhymes. Now think back to "Entry 439" from Scarblade's <b>Tales of Neovia</b> story. <b>A particular new acquaintance of mine has agreed to help me in this search. She and I will set out soon.</b> Ah? What if that friend is Vira or her faerie mistress?

<br><br>

The Three isn't the only villainous trio in Neopia, though. A while back we mentioned the Dark Faerie Sisters, they're a trio. And depending on how relevant <b>Tales of Neovia</b> is, that could be a sign of their involvement. The Darkest Faerie was counted among the villains in it, so if she's involved, her sisters are probably involved. Another trio? The Drenched, who recently enjoyed a spate of strong storms over Maraqua. Now, The Drenched were NOT included in <b>Tales of Neovia</b>, but...

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/tcg/cotd_water/0004_HV06_maraqua.gif" alt="Villainous faeries who AREN'T Dark?" title="Villainous faeries who AREN'T Dark?"></center>

<br><br>

...the flavor text on their card even references the same proverb Jewel did. Or maybe it's all of the trios. The Drenched, the Sisters, and The Three. With 10 months of plot, maybe they'll take this time to address the Neopian theme of villainous trios as a whole. Whatever this means, if Vira and her mistress make a new friend, that confirms the speculation that some sort of coven is being formed. A team of more than just two.

<br><br>

After that segment, Amanda gets into what everyone liked best about working on this. And it's your usual fare, "I like everything, I'm so thankful," but at <b>32:35</b> Jewel says <b>I'm really enjoying sinking my teeth into and digging into the character dynamics, and the way that they can express themselves in their relationships. I've gotten to write a lot of fun moments like that, and I've even had a moment as I was writing one of the chapters where, like, two characters were kind of talking with one another and they were opening up a little bit, but not too much, and I look at the... like, as it was happening on the page and I realized a relationship was developing.</b> So, Jewel's recommendation? There's a part in this plot where two characters have a moment and grow closer, it's gonna be really good so keep an eye out for that. Ah, but who? Speculation has cast a wide net for who might be involved in this thing. And with 10 months of runtime, a lot can happen to a lot of people. Maybe we come back to Jhudora and Illusen? Their relationship has been softening up, and they were just in the Faerie Festival. But then, maybe that means they absolutely WON'T be in this plot because we just had them. But again, 10 months??? With that kind of runtime they could resolve literally every dangling plot thread in all Neopian lore. 

<br><br>

As for what Aesop would like you to keep an eye out for? At <b>34:20</b> he mentions <b>character and dynamics both new and old that I think/we're really hoping some people will relate to.</b> Seems like we're about to face some "familiar" struggles. That this is going to be a very "personal" plot. And the relating has already started. Since the shopkeepers started turning Grey, there's been no shortage of sympathy on social media, "Care" reactions on Facebook "My face when retail" memes far and wide across the Internet. Because we've all been there, haven't we? The Void being where we go when we leave Neopia isn't the only metaphor to grasp here.

<br><br>

Eventually Fallie decides to turn the tables and ask Amanda a question: What is she most curious about? Amanda, like a lot of people who cut their teeth on Neopets, is a fan of Lord Kass. And she was curious what, if anything, that sword in the stone meant. You remember the one.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/umrwcO1.png" width="450" alt="Kass confirmed for Fortnite Season 3???" title="Kass confirmed for Fortnite Season 3???"><br><br>

At <b>44:59</b>, Aesop had this to say: <b>It definitely seems like it belonged to someone in particular. Whatever happened to the wielder of that sword? Well, I guess you could surmise that they might be in that same strange place that our characters were surviving in, seemed pretty dangerous? I guess we don't know if someone would be able to survive in that harsh condition, maybe if they're a survivor they might be able to? But I guess only time will tell. I think we'll get a little bit more looks into what might be happening within The Void or around The Void.</b>

<br><br>

Now you probably know Neostaff is a cheeky lot. Aesop didn't outright confirm it with words you could hold him to in court... but this is as much a confirmation as anything. That is Kass's sword. Kass is in this thing. Not just in this thing, but in The Void! That must be where The Three sent him after he failed to live up to his potential! And potentially where Darigan went when he failed to live up to his potential! And if Kass is definitely tied to this thing, there's VERY strong odds that The Three are tied to this thing. Moving them up in the seed ranking for "The Bad Thing Coming In Threes" that Jewel was talking about. Yes, speculation confirmed: That's Kass's sword and he's part of this plot.

<br><br>

Amanda also asks about Orion's Lyre. The one Fyora could not get a bead on. Stone steps in at <b>46:15</b> to tell us what's been happening with our heroic trio, Orion, Reina, and Fyora. Good things come in threes too. <b>The Advent Calendar was definitely the strongest visions Orion has had. Since then there's been some flare-ups, but no matter how much he plays it, he just can't seem to get that sort of clarity again. But I do have a feeling we'll learn more about it soon, and if you are hoping to learn more about it, and maybe see where/when/why? All of those things about it? You will definitely wanna make sure you login to those events that I've been talking about. Because they might have something to do with it every now and then.</b> Events like the Festival of Neggs and Cup. Okay, for some mysterious reason, Orion can't hit on that "inspiration" he used to have. The "holiday magic" of <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/wintercelebration.phtml">Winter Starlight</a> is lacking, perhaps? Something lacking within, maybe? It'll be good to know, at least, why he thinks he can't trigger those visions. Clairvoyancy isn't a reliable science, after all.

<br><br>

And finally, before the closing interview with Dom and the release of the Rare Item Code, Amanda asks for one last clue. Anything more we can say is solidly confirmed? Yes. As thanks for watching this far, at <b>47:43</b> Aesop finally drops the actual name of our Aisha hero: <b>I think the least I can do is give at least one detail, and I think that would be the name of our new protagonist, which is Nyx. Spelled N-Y-X. Just like a certain Greek goddess of the night. We first saw her during Advent Calendar trying to survive in The Void with her trusted Petpet mechanic. She survived the harrowing ordeal with the help of her friend there. But, I would like to also publicly mention right now while we're all here that said Petpet is still, in fact, holding on. He's in rough shape to be sure, and he definitely needs some help soon, but he's still hanging in there. And we could reveal that name later, but for now I'll just leave you with Nyx.</b>

<br><br>

At last, she has a name. We don't have to call her "our Aisha hero" anymore. Nyx. But is it just a name, or is it symbolic? After all, Orion's name has meaning. Orion is a constellation, and he's a reader of the stars as well as a contributor in that "Bythons From Space" adventure. But perhaps even more significant? His last name is Ophiuchus. The "serpent-bearer" constellation. And again... Bythons. So what might Nyx mean? Aesop was keen to point out the parallels between the Greek goddess of the night. Might the night aspect be relevant to her? Might the fact that she's a daughter of Chaos be relevant to her? That tentacled thing looks pretty chaotic. And in the Greek pantheon, "Chaos" is described as "the mythological void state preceding the creation of the universe." VOID state. Ahhhh??? Described as a great, dark expanse of nothingness. Kinda recalls that <b>Tales of Neovia</b> story about the Shadow Usul: <b>All living things know darkness, but this was not darkness. This was pure nothing.</b> So if "chaos" as a corporeal concept is involved, which means the Shadow Usul is involved... and if Kass is involved which almost certainly means The Three are involved... it would be kind of a snub to not involve the whole <b>Tales of Neovia</b> cast, wouldn't it??? Which really makes you wonder how everyone else is tied in. Scarblade might be Vira's new friend... Sloth might be in The Void...

<br><br>

Also, Nyx sounds a lot like "Nox," which is her Roman name. And the name of one very undead Chia warlock. Does that mean anything?</li>

<br><br><li>From here you can either stick around for the interview with Dom, or just redeem your code. Again: <b>THEVOIDWITHIN</b>. Your prize? A Void Negg. Not a new prize, it was originally released during Festival of Neggs 2021. 

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/fon_void_negg.gif" alt="Avoid looking directly into the centre of this negg at all costs, lest the void devour what makes you whole... This was given out as a prize for the Y23 Festival of Neggs." title="Avoid looking directly into the centre of this negg at all costs, lest the void devour what makes you whole... This was given out as a prize for the Y23 Festival of Neggs."></center>

<br><br>

Now, it's technically not "from" <b>The Void Within</b>, but could it be repurposed as something symbolic? In the same way that you might give out copies of "The Big Book of Intermediate Evil Plots" as part of a promotion to tell people that an evil plot is underway? Besides, they only finished putting the bones together for this plot as of July 29th, 2022. How long were the ideas and concepts knocking around in people's heads? How long did Aesop and the other writers know that The Void was coming?

<br><br>

The description of the Void Negg reads <b>Avoid looking directly into the centre of this negg at all costs, lest the void devour what makes you whole...</b> maybe The Void takes something from you? It definitely changes some people. It changed our Faellie hero, and in a grabby, devour-y fashion. And if Lord Darigan was sent to The Void and came back Redeemed, maybe The Void consumed his darker tendencies and left only the parts of him that were noble? And then there's the prizes that could be found inside one of these back when the 2021 Festival was on. Not this exact negg, this one is just food. But if we were doin gthe 2021 Festival right now and you found a Void Negg, you'd have your choice of 3 prizes...

<br><br>

Any of these might be significant when it comes to story or plot steps or both or some third thing. But what really stands out is that book, "Navigating the Void." The description reads <b>This ancient tome was created by an inquisitive warlock who developed portals that allowed him to travel between worlds...</b> Do we know any "inquisitive warlocks" who develop portals? We know at least one: Magon. The signs keep pointing to him. Maybe he's the third friend that Vira and her faerie mistress make? We already got Kass, we got an appearance from Brightvale in a rift in spacetime... we're already in the area for it. 

<br><br>

10 months of content. The biggest plot in history, it could be. Definitely seems like the most ambitious. This could be the plot that closes the book on all lore prior. The plot to end them all. Does that sound a little bittersweet? Because this could mean a brave new future moving forward. This might be the "soft reboot" Neopia could potentially benefit from. Maybe the story of Neopia itself is the one long overdue for a resolution, and this is what resolves it. In closing...

<br><br><b>What We Know</b>
<br>
1. <b>The shopkeepers cannot paint themselves to be free of the Grey curse</b>
<br>
2. <b>10 months of content is coming down the pipe for The Void Within</b>
<br>
3. <b>Vira and her faerie mistress are not alone</b>
<br>
4. <b>Two characters will have a moment where their relationship develops</b>
<br>
5. <b>Try as he might, Orion can't see any visions as vivid as the ones he saw around the holidays</b>
<br>
6. <b>The Aisha's name is Nyx, like the Greek goddess of night and daughter of Chaos</b>

<br><br><b>What's Functionally Certain</b>
<br>
1. <b>Vira and her faerie mistress may have made a new friend</b>
<br>
2. <b>Bad things come in threes</b>
<br>
3. <b>Kass and his sword are in in The Void</b>
<br>
4. <b>If you've got the stuff of a survivor, you might endure The Void and come back to Neopia stronger and richer for the experience</b>
<br>
5. <b>We might hear more about Orion fiddling with his Lyre in future events in the coming weeks</b>
<br>
6. <b>Hopefully, Tales of Dacardia will organically reflect things happening in Neopia, which includes The Void Within</b>

<br><br>

But if this plot is big enough, maybe just about everything in history will be involved. The <b>Tales of Neovia</b> villains, and everyone else. Every story worth remembering in Neopia might find its way back to The Void.

</li></ul><br><b>26th March, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>Took a little longer than last time, but we've got another Grey shopkeeper. And if you're up to date on the clues (even the spoilery ones) you probably know who the <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=15">next one</a> is.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4T2l4z6.png" width="450" alt="One man's bad batch is another man's freegan brunch." title="One man's bad batch is another man's freegan brunch."><br><br>

Call him the "Sourdough Breadmaster now." On top of that, the Grey shopkeepers have now all switched to GIFs, not PNGs. Which is why the <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=5">Grooming Parlour Usul</a> can now be seen in all her grey, bloodshot glory.

<br><br>

That's 3 of 5. What's more, we may have a pattern... 

<br><br>

1. <b>Ellia turned Grey on March 18th. A Monday.</b>
<br>
2. <b>Grooming Parlour Usul turned Grey on the 21st. A Thursday, 3 business days after Ellia.</b>
<br>
3. <b>Breadmaster turned Grey on the 26th. So you've got Friday, then the weekend, Monday, and then Tuesday. 3 business days after the Grooming Parlour Usul if you don't count the weekend.</b>

<br><br>

Probably just a coincidence? We'll know by Friday, March 29th if we get another Grey shopkeeper. But who can wait that long when <b>Neopets Live: The Void Within Edition</b> is happening TOMORROW at 5PM NST? Surely a night of revelations. Who knows, we might get all our Grey shopkeepers early?

</li></ul><br><b>21st March, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li><b>New Grey shopkeeper!</b> Remember that issue from yesterday where the .PNG versions of these images aren't loading right now, save for Ellia's? Well...

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mGCyMsm.png" width="450" alt="Taken by the Void?" title="Taken by the Void?"><br><br><b>w5.png</b> is trying to load here. In the same way that <b>w4.png</b> loaded and worked just fine for Ellia. But it's not working. But y'know what does work? <b>w5.gif</b>. Which you may have already seen before.

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/plots/tvw/images/shopkeepers/w5.gif" width="450" alt="Grey is beautiful too, right?" title="Grey is beautiful too, right?"><br><br>

She looks totally out of it. It's almost like... she's got a "void" somewhere "within" her? Draining the life from around her? Even the Kacheek's hair looks duller compared to the way things used to look.

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/shopkeepers/w5.gif" width="450" alt="The whole room looks brighter before the Grey." title="The whole room looks brighter before the Grey."><br><br>

Keep an eye on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=5">Grooming Parlour</a> and see if this image gets fixed today. One Grey 'pet is probably no cause for alarm. But two? How many until Neopians start to suspect that there may be some kind of pandemic afoot? Maybe five? Probably five. Will we get all five shopkeepers Greyed before the Neopets Live? 

</li></ul><br><b>20th March, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>If you been checking the shops lately, waiting for more Grey people to show up, you might not have found anything. That is, if you checked the front end. Or if you took <b>w4.png</b> and kept changing the number from w1 to w117. But <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=rawbeee">Rawbeee</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=alan_sjm2">Alan_SJM2</a> have been doing some digging <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=163040718">here</a>. Waiting to go live are four more shopkeepers, soon to be Greyed.

<br><br>

Yeah, for some reason there's a .GIF version of each Grey shopkeeper image, and a .PNG version of each Grey shopkeeper image. And for some reason the .GIF versions were updated, but the .PNG versions were not.

<br><br>

We understand that not everyone wants to know this, that it's a spoiler unless you can go find it on Neopets or from Neostaff. So we won't post the images here, but if you'd like to look at them, Rawbeee has a curated collection <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Camont">here</a>. A petpage that's currently linking to all of the <b>plots/tvw/images/shopkeepers</b> URLs that can exist. So when another one goes live, it should show up there. But of course, images are only half the story. We want dialogue/flavor text! So we still need to keep checking the actual shops, it's just these images give us the shops we need to keep a closer eye on.

<br><br>

What might also be an effect of the Grey Plague sweeping Neopia? Some people have noticed how the highlight around Alerts are grey. If you use the Neopets Basic site theme.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jNacglD.png" alt="But who uses Neopets Basic?" title="But who uses Neopets Basic?"></center>

<br><br>

But then, that might've always been that way. It isn't clear, because these Alerts do look grey on the Fan Sites, but then again these Fan Sites might just be fetching the styles from Neopets. In the same way a petpage can fetch an image. It's hard to get ahold of anyone who actually uses Neopets Basic and can confirm or deny that the grey highlights are new.</li>

<br><br><li>But the plotly revelations will soon come DIRECTLY to you, because a new Neopets Live/Direct is on the way. And it's all about <b>The Void Within</b>! They can't all be about plots, but it's great to have one again.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/S283cZp.png" width="450" alt="It's been 3 months..." title="It's been 3 months..."><br><br>

Make sure you don't miss that Rare Item Code either, for everything is a clue when plots are involved. We'll see you there.

</li></ul><br><b>18th March, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>It was a pretty dry winter, plot-wise. We've had plenty of Live events, but none have brought plot news. And that "Grarrl Wraith" from the last entry? Turned out to be old, scrapped content from <a href="//www.neopets.com/twr/">The Wraith Resurgence</a>. But spring is here, ladies and gentlemen. And people are noticing <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=163035914">a change in the surroundings</a>.

Ellia of <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=4">Uni's Clothing</a> is feeling Grey. Really feeling Grey. Down to her bones. She doesn't just look Grey, she's got a Grey disposition. She's not really "feeling" the diverse array of colors and textures that she's known for purveying. "Poor taste" she calls it. How sure are we that this is plot related? How sure are we that this isn't just speculation? It might have something to do with the image URL.

<br><br><a href="//images.neopets.com/plots/tvw/images/shopkeepers/w4.png">https://images.neopets.com/plots/tvw/images/shopkeepers/w4.png</a>

<br><br>

Note the <b>plots/tvw</b> directory it's coming from. 

<br><br>

So far Ellia is the only Shopkeeper made Grey. But how did she get this way? Is it... contagious??? And are you better off Grey than whatever color our Faellie hero is? "Interesting plot when it comes to color" indeed. The <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a> hasn't even started yet! No way does Kari ignore this, especially if it's spreading. Maybe Baelia will be this year's "traveling partner?"

<br><br>

Keep your eyes open for anyone showing symptoms. Grey Day is April 14th, if we're diligent we should be well into addressing this phenomenon by then.

You might be wondering if this "Grarrl Wraith" might be a holdover from <a href="//www.neopets.com/twr/">The Wraith Resurgence</a>. Maybe a scrapped item themed after one of the challengers. Well, first you have to remember that none of the Fan Sites have found it. Even though finding unreleased items is what they deal in. Suggesting that the item was only findable very recently. Second, the Resurgence offered no Grarrl-themed challengers. The challengers it DID offer, were...

<br><br>

So why would a Grarrl Wraith be introduced now? Are wraiths about to make another appearance? Is the tentacle creature from whence all wraiths come? More thought food to chew on while we wait for the next course of prologue.

</li></ul><br><b>26th January, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>The new era for Neopia continues to roll in. It's Neopian Times... <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?week=1000">Issue One Thousand</a>! From August 11th, 2001, to today. The Times has been around for almost every plot in Neopian history. If you wanna count the <a href="//www.neopets.com/nt_archive.phtml">very ancient editions</a> of the Neopian Times, then it has been around for every plot. Since January 25th, 2000. About 24 years on the dot, the Times has been running.

<br><br>

Speaking of plots, this Edition of the Times comes with a few statements of note in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=1000">Editorial</a> regarding <b>The Void Within</b>. Director <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop</a> and a staffer named Tumble field a few questions. The first comes from <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=superkouza">SuperKouza</a>, who raised the question of whether or not we were there watching Orion's visions unfold.

<br><br><b>Were we all present for Orion playing Lyre at the Advent Lodge? The way Reina said "We need to tell someone" suggests it was just her and Orion (and Fyora). But Orion showed up at Winter Starlight with this news, which suggests he probably had tourists and revelers and mountain/valley natives listening in. I'm just curious what "alert state" Neopia is on as far as the looming threat. Is it top secret, known to only Fyora's closest? Is it whispers in shadows? Sceptic Tank conspiracy theory? Trending news story? Or maybe widespread panic? Is anyone heeding Orion's order to start preparing for war?</b>

<br><br>

Aesop reveals that yes, things are moving and shaking off camera. Just like you should be.

<br><br><b><i>An excellent question! Several onlookers attending the Advent Calendar festivities were present for Orion's pleas for help over the course of the Festival, and a small crowd actually began to gather as he shared his visions. Although some Neopians dismissed the events, a few even claiming it was an elaborate hoax to promote his tarot cards, a sense of disquietude has already begun to creep across the globe. Whispers of impending peril have reached even the most remote corners of Neopia, and rumours circulate about the leaders of various lands preparing for the possibility of the unprecedented era of peace they've enjoyed coming to an end... </i></b>

<br><br>

So there you have it. All your 'pets were confirmed to be there, basically. 

<br><br>

This next question comes from an anonymous inquirer. Asking what sort of challenge we might be up against.

<br><br><b>Hey TNT, thank you for the NCUC, now all our lab rats can look beautiful. Speaking of, with the upcoming plot, how hard should we train? Will those of us who have been training our pets for years and have a decent battledome set have a challenge?</b>

<br><br>

Tumble takes this one, explaining what you probably already know about the Battledome and Neostaff's continuing mission to make it more accessible than it is.

<br><br><b><i>Although we are planning on ensuring that the Battledome is accessible to new users who are not as familiar with it, there's a strong possibility that you will be facing off against some especially tough opponents who could give even the most seasoned Battledome veterans a run for their neopoints. And on the opposite end, we'll also ensure that users who aren't big fans of the Battledome still get something to do during the more battle-heavy sections of the plot!</i></b>

<br><br>

And finally, <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=nguyeplm">Nguyeplm</a> is just curious about the plot in general.

<br><br><b>Would you be able to give anymore information about the upcoming plot?</b>

<br><br>

Aesop responds with the news we maybe should've led with.

<br><br><b><i>Although we can't share a specific date just yet, you can expect to have a few more months to prepare before the start of the plot. That being said, there might just be a few hints of what is to come popping up before the plot begins, so be sure to keep an eye out for them! Oh, and one last bit of plot info I wanted to touch upon- While our brave little Faellie friend from Orion's visions certainly is in bad shape, he's still holding on! I just hope he can get some help soon… </i></b>

<br><br>

That story again: <b><i>THE FAELLIE IS ALIVE!!!</i></b> He's a little purple but he's STILL WITH US!!! That means we can FIGHT FOR HIM!!!

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8Ko47TU.png" alt="DEFEND THIS FAELLIE" title="DEFEND THIS FAELLIE"></center>

<br><br>

Also? The plot won't be starting for a few more months, yet. Which seems to confirm that yes, that "What's Next" section in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/releasenotes/">Release Notes</a> is in order and we'll have to wait until after the Cup to get cookin'. But you probably already assumed as much. The real news you most likely care about is that THE FAELLIE IS NOT DEAD. WE HAVE TO SAVE THE FAELLIE.

<br><br>

Tonight's stories, in conclusion...

<br><br>

1. <b>Word is spreading off camera about the dangers headed for Neopia.</b>
<br>
2. <b>Don't sit this one out, there's going to be something for everyone to do.</b>
<br>
3. <b>Things probably won't start getting hot until after the Altador Cup.</b>
<br>
4. <b><i>THE FAELLIE IS ALIVE</i></b>

<br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tfr/">The Faeries' Ruin</a> had the famous pie. <b>The Void Within</b> has this Faellie. In some way, shape, or form, he's still out there. Waiting for Neopia's heroes. Will you join them?

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/mall/stylingstudio/images/logo.png" width="450" alt="Shoomlah's Darigan Bori is avenged." title="Shoomlah's Darigan Bori is avenged."><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/umbra-16-9.png" width="450" alt="Calm and chaos, leave everything on the canvas." title="Calm and chaos, leave everything on the canvas."><br><br> 

Hmmmm... here's something, the preloader for the Styling Studio is a Faellie. Like that Faellie who was lost in space was a Faellie. Relevant? Maybe? This is supposed to be a plot dealing with color as a theme, and Styling Studio is about color. Maybe they're the same Faellie? Maybe???

<br><br> 

Alright, so we have our Neocash Unconverteds now. The kids have had their fun. Do we have anything of substance to go on about <b>The Void Within</b>? Yes, in fact. Last night there was an update to the <a href="//www.neopets.com/releasenotes/">Release Notes</a> in the wake of NC Pet Styles. As usual, there's a "What's Next" section which seems to detail the roadmap of events moving forward, in order of launch. Presumably in order of launch, anyway.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/C6OYkwJ.png" width="450" alt="Is it A Void or THE Void?" title="Is it A Void or THE Void?"><br><br> 

So if this is in order of release, it looks like <b>The Void Within</b> has been delayed again. No longer Q2, it's been pushed to after the Cup. Also known as "Q3-Q4." Could be any time in July, August, September, or October, November, and December. This at least solves the scheduling conflict. No more wondering what'll happen with the Cup and Festival, because the plot no longer threatens their time slot. After the Cup, there's real estate as far as the eye can see. The Cup ends in very early July, August and September have no regularly scheduled events. October is dedicated to general spookiness, there's usually some Trick-or-Treating. November has Neopets' Birthday, and then there's December with Winter Starlight. You know the drill, we just did it. 

<br><br> 

Aside from Winter Starlight, seems like we could have the plot any time between July and November and cause no problems. October might be dicey because we gotta have Halloween, right? But surely Halloween is the perfect time for a plot. A perfect time for the darkest of forces to take hold of Neopia, for epic and decisive battles. Halloween made for a great backdrop during <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tfr/">The Faeries' Ruin</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/twr/">The Wraith Resurgence</a>, to similar effect. There's a reason the first two seasons of Stranger Things are set around that time. But then, how long would we have to wait if we want this plot to creep into Halloween? With everything happening on time, the longest a plot usually lasts is 3 months. The Wraith Resurgence lasted longer, but it's speculated that this wasn't on purpose. That there were delays. So if, IF we want some solid spooky time with this plot... would we have to wait until August? Maybe even September? That's when TFR kicked off, but on the other hand it also lasted until Christmas. Which also makes for a nice backdrop if you ask director Shane Black. But Orion just made his case for how we probably shouldn't have a Winter Starlight until these dark forces are dealt with. So... how about a plot that lasts through October and ends just in time for Neopets Birthday? It's the 25th Anniversary, we will have defeated what might be Neopia's darkest threat, it'll be a time of great celebration. And we'll keep things rolling into Winter Starlight where Orion and Reina can reflect on how far they've come together since he showed up with his Lyre just one year prior. At a TFR pace, the earliest this would have to kick off would be mid-August. 

<br><br> 

But then, who says this plot has to last just 3 months? Again, it's the 25th Anniversary. It's a very special year, maybe this plot should should start early and last long. From July to "Question Marks." Maybe this should be the plot to end all plots. To shift the paradigm, to lay down new groundwork. Important years tend to be about celebrating the legacy of the old, and then wiping the slate clean to start on the promise and potential of the new. Maybe that's what we're getting out of <b>The Void Within</b>? If speculation is correct that this is going to involve multiple historic villains? Yes, it's only speculation right now, but one thing we know for sure is that there's a sword that looks too much like Kass's own sword for it to just be a coincidence. Portals are appearing and showing Brightvale, that can't be a coincidence either.

<br><br>

We've got a bit longer to wait. But on the bright side, the Festival of Neggs is primed for more of that prologue <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop</a> said we would see in upcoming events. And potentially the Cup too, we gotta give those snowbirds a reason to stick around after the Cup ends. Yes, it makes sense to push the plot back so that the snowbirds get a chance to hear about it. Surely this was the way it had to happen all along. Patience...

</li></ul><br><b>15th January, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>It's <b>Sloth Day</b> (observed), and... nothing teased about Sloth and any potential relation to <b>The Void Within</b>. In the <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2024-01-15">New Features</a> or anywhere else. Does this rule him out? Considering Orion did at one point get a "stay tuned" sort of nod on the Neopets Facebook page? Not necessarily. But as we continue to revisit speculation, let's remember we don't have confirmation he's involved. So maybe he's not.

<br><br>

Vira, however, is definitely cookin' somethin' up. And we've got <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162867691">another discovery</a> from <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=smudgeoffudge">SmudgeOfFudge</a> that might shed further light on that.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5yfUcgO.png" width="450" alt="Barbat Wing Blade It appears on the Shop Wizard. Who would use this? Maybe Vira got an upgrade." title="Barbat Wing Blade It appears on the Shop Wizard. Who would use this? Maybe Vira got an upgrade."><br><br>

This time we've got "Barbat Wing Blade." Still no image as far as we can find, but it sounds like a weapon. Maybe the kind of weapon Vira might use? Just look at what she typically carries in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/dome/">Battledome</a>: Viras Winged Dagger, Viras Cape of Darkness, Viras Battle Bats, and Viras Spiked Collar. Batty wings are a theme.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_vira_dagger.gif" alt="A beautiful blade that Vira made herself." title="A beautiful blade that Vira made herself."><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_vira_cape.gif" alt="Eww... this cape smells funny!" title="Eww... this cape smells funny!"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_vira_bats.gif" alt="When Vira unleashes these foul pests you had better run and hide." title="When Vira unleashes these foul pests you had better run and hide."><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_vira_collar.gif" alt="Much more than just a simple fashion accessory, this collar is Viras favourite weapon." title="Much more than just a simple fashion accessory, this collar is Viras favourite weapon."></center>

<br><br>

And come to think of it, let's pull up that Fancy-Hilted Knife again...

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_fancy_hilted_knife.gif" alt="Not released yet." title="Not released yet."></center>

<br><br>

That hilt, kinda looks like Acara ears, maybe? Maybe the Fancy-Hilted Knife and the Barbat Wing Blade are both weapons that Vira will be bringing to battle in the plot? Maybe that's why we haven't seen them released yet: They aren't being released, and are unique 1P weapons that will either be available in the prize shop to come, or never released and only wielded by their original opponents.

<br><br>

Which brings us back to that Malum Cloak. Will Vira be wearing that too? If so, how is it she and Malum/Reizo meet, and how does she come to possess his cloak? Does TDF just take it from him?

<br><br>

If these items aren't just 1P weapons and are to be released, it might be later rather than sooner. We didn't get any Sloth teasers today, but we did get something people might be more excited about: The announcement of the long awaited "Neocash For Unconverted 'Pets" feature.

If there's any period in the content schedule that's absolutely locked up, the next week or so is probably dedicated entirely to NC Pet Styles.

And won't be back up until NC Pet Styles is ready for launch.

But take care to remember that live event. There's gonna be more to it than just NC Pet Styles. And arm up. Vira just might be.</li></ul><br><b>14th January, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>Extra late breaking bulletin! <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=smudgeoffudge">SmudgeOfFudge</a> found <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162863639">ANOTHER</a> unreleased item on the backend!

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/K8etiRe.png" width="450" alt="A new unlisted item I found on the Shop Wizard Not listed on Jellyneo or dress to impress I went to fight Vira, to see if she used th3 new knife, but she's using Malum items.

We still don't know what these Malum items are that Smudge saw Vira wielding, we weren't able to catch her holding them. But anyone today can search up "Malum Cloak" and get positive results on the Shop Wizard. We don't have an image like with the Fancy-Hilted Knife, but we do have a name.

<br><br>

If you served during <a href="//www.neopets.com/twr/">The Wraith Resurgence</a>, you'll recall that Malum is the name Kaia's friend Reizo went by after The Darkest Faerie transformed him. That's Reizo on the left and Malum on the right, if you didn't infer.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DtNiDEu.jpg" width="450" alt="Before and After" title="Before and After"><br><br>

One of the main case makers for Baelia being the faerie to star in <b>The Void Within</b> is that this is going to be "a heartfelt tale involving a certain faerie long overdue for a resolution." But the operative word is "long," not "longest." The Resurgence wrapped up in 2018. That's not as far back as 2003, but it left us hanging on some things like "What happens to Malum/Reizo? Does he get cured? What about the fact that his brooch and TDF's ring were draining the life from them? They took them off, right? What becomes of the brooch and ring?" So maybe that's the resolution we're overdue for. Maybe the faerie to star is actually Kaia. Which might make sense considering this is a story involving psychic forecasting. Orion is psychic, Kaia is psychic. Also, like Vira, Reizo was changed by dark forces he was naive enough to trust. But if this isn't about Baelia, what a red herring Vira's grey book turned out to be...

<br><br>

Or maybe Malum's cloak is a weapon he might've been equipped with during the Resurgence, but plans changed. This, as well as what that Fancy-Hilted Knife is for, will be answered soon.

</li></ul><br><b>13th January, 2024</b>

<br><ul><li>It's a new year! Maybe in more ways than one. A lot of notable things happening in 2024, for instance we're about to hit Issue #1000 of the Neopian Times. Oh, and <b>The Void Within</b>, obviously. 

<br><br>

But right now things are kinda quiet. And so, people are foraging for whatever plot crumbs they can find. People like <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=smudgeoffudge">SmudgeOfFudge</a>, who spends her days scanning the backend for any new items. Like when she found the Holiday Snow Lyre. And she's <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162862771">found another one</a>.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xVIJfb5.png" width="450" alt="Appears on the Shop Wizard but not Jelly Neo. Hmmm, what do you know Mr. Shop Wizard? Could it be Viras knife or maybe Malkus Vile?

Hmmm, what do you know Mr. Shop Wizard? Could it be Viras knife or maybe Malkus Vile? Oh who dropped their knife? But maybe it's a fancy cheese knife as a reward for the Neopies. Mmm...cheese..."><br><br>Fancy-Hilted Knife." And the image is easy enough to find if you make the safe assumption that it's a Battledome weapon. The full name of the item is in its image, as <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=rougethebat300">RougeTheBat300</a> put together: <b>bd_fancy_hilted_knife.gif</b>.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_fancy_hilted_knife.gif" alt="Looks like a handy tool, as well as a weapon." title="Looks like a handy tool, as well as a weapon."></center>

<br><br>

Let's think back to the Holiday Snow Lyre. Found on December 24th, given out on December 26th. Moral of that story: When an item becomes discoverable like this, it means it's about to be given out very soon. But from the looks of it, where might it come from? The <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopies/">Neopies</a> would be our next "regularly scheduled" event, might it come from there? Doesn't really match the current Neopies color scheme though, does it? Not enough gold. But with snow whites and dark greys, it's got a real "January" vibe to it. Icy cold. Maybe it's just an ordinary weapon for an ordinary content day? Once upon a time we used to get as many as 4 new items a day, in addition to the usual wearables. It's the 25th Anniversary, we might be trying to head back to the content schedules of 10-15 years ago. Though that would be an incredibly tall order, so what are the odds of that, really? 

<br><br>

Odds are this item belongs to an event of some kind. Which is good to know because January is usually a content desert. The next cool thing is eagerly anticipated. Maybe the plot is actually kicking off early and the knife comes from that?

<br><br>

Sloth Day is on Monday, and we've got a January Neopets Live/AMA on the 17th. The live event is gonna focus on the new NC Style Pet feature to come, but if we've still gotta wait for the plot maybe more crumbs will come from one of these two events. Depending on how on the mark speculation has been. An interesting plot when it comes to color, right?

<br><br><li>Reading between the lines, this seems to answer (or at least address) a lot. For instance, Fyora didn't show up saying "Hey Xandra's on the loose we need to get moving on solutions." So Xandra is probably not loose right now. Unless she was unpetrified while Fyora was making her trip to <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/wintercelebration.phtml">Winter Starlight</a>. Does that mean that's not Xandra in the vision? Well, we don't know when that Brightvale scene is set. Or when the visions are set, for that matter. Maybe that is Xandra, and her depetrification comes later.

<br><br>

Also? Reina didn't break down in tears, sobbing "That's my mom! My mom is the Aisha!" So, does that mean the Aisha isn't Reina's mom? Well, not necessarily. Maybe Reina just didn't think to mention it? Or... maybe she's young enough/old enough in these visions that Reina doesn't recognize her? In fact, y'know what else is probably meaningful? That <b>Virtupets Delivery Pilot Training Manual</b>. The description reads <b>Being a Virtupets Delivery Pilot is a dangerous job that can keep you away from your family for long stretches of time. If you are going to succeed in this profession, you better be prepared for anything! This was given out by the Advent Calendar in Y25.</b> So is that it? The Aisha from the visions is a Virtupets delivery pilot? If so, consider that the job keeps you away from your family for long stretches of time. Think truckers, except instead of being gone a month or two you're gone... incredibly long? Like years and years? Kinda tragic, though. Not a job someone with a family should take, maybe? Especially a family with a lucrative and enriching business as one of Santa's own helpers every Winter Starlight? Reina's mom would have to hate her or something to say "I'm sorry, I just love the depths of space so much that unfortunately I have to basically leave the family." But then again, if Reina's mom ISN'T a delivery pilot, where is she??? Plot or not, it's just an interesting question.

<br><br>

Whether the Aisha is Reina's mom or not, let's assume for now they are a Virtupets delivery pilot. How relevant does that make today's animation to the plot? Because there's still that question of "Are the animations themselves plot relevant?" Virtupets delivery pilot, animation set on Virtupets Space Station...? Because if not, then that potentially rules out the other ones. Maybe that <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/advents_past.phtml?year=2023&amp;day=15">Bython animation</a> was just a Bython animation, nothing more. Maybe that <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/advents_past.phtml?year=2023&amp;day=6">Shadow Usul animation</a> was just a reference to <b>Tales of Neovia</b>, as the Advent Calendar is wont to reference the notable hits of the year's content schedule. It was a thing that happened this year, so it gets an AdCal animation. Bythons were a thing that happened this year, so they get an AdCal animation. Which threatens the theory that ALL of the <b>Tales of Neovia</b> villains are tied to the plot. Shadow Usul might not be in this plot, Shadow Usul might just be in this AdCal scene. Same might even go for the Bythons.

<br><br>

But not Magon, not yet. Portals showing up in Brightvale? The coincidence is too perfect. And if Magon is related, Bythons might be related. Or if not for Magon, surely for Orion. And Vira is related for sure, we've already seen her in one of the comics. It's just the other villains might be red herrings. But there's still the matter of that sword that looks an awful lot like Kass's sword. Kass's sword connects to Kass, which could conceivably connect to The Three, which could connect conceivably to the other villains.

<br><br>

As valuable as the crystals might be in this Void place, if the Aisha is specifically a Virtupets delivery pilot, that might rule out their working for <a href="//www.neopets.com/moon/mining.phtml">Kreludan Mining</a>. And it would REALLY rule out their working for Moltara Obsidian. The Aisha is some kind of space trucker, it seems. Although they could be hauling mined materials? In any case, it doesn't seem like this delivery Aisha was headed to The Void on purpose. Incredible service from <a href="//www.neopets.com/dungdash/">DungDash</a> if they go out that far, though. So if the Aisha had no intentional business in the Void or whatever that place in the universe is, that device is probably not anything they understand. If the device can ONLY work if it's powered by Void energy. They didn't go there looking to do experiments, they know nothing of the Void, weren't expecting a portal to Brightvale, they know just as much as we do. For now, anyway. 

<br><br>

Also? It really does seem like that whole "Alien Aisha tattoo" was merely a trick of the light. So they likely don't have Alien Aisha ties... yet. So if all the speculation is off, what do we have? We have that a currently unidentified Aisha and their unidentified Faellie (who might be space truckers) ended up somewhere in the universe they know nothing about. The Faellie, through gifts they didn't originally have, slapped together a life-saving device for the Aisha. The Aisha looked through some kind of rift at Brightvale. Meanwhile Vira, if no one else, is working with her faerie mistress to check on the seed they planted. Whatever that seed might be. Tentacle monster seeds? But don't be discouraged. Maybe the Aisha doesn't work for Monty. But if it's true that Monty needs energy, and if it's true that the Void has energy, he'll certainly find his way up there eventually.

<br><br>

So there's a lot there that might not mean anything. Really felt like the Aishanaut was Reina's mom. But what IS important? We still don't know what the lyre is. And apparently neither does Fyora. Let's consider her appearance. She shows up to explain that she's been tracking the incredible magical signal of this lyre for the better part of the holidays. Fyora doesn't even know what it is. That would make it an artefact of considerable legend, because Fyora knows a lot and was around for a lot. But what if it's not from this planet? Fyora knows a lot about Neopia, but we're dealing with places that, well, aren't Neopia. Seems the current objective is finding out what this lyre is. The lyre is trying to lead us to this Void that threatens Neopia, so we should try and understand the lyre. But then, who's "we?" It seemed like Orion was sharing those visions with everyone who was around. But then Reina was like "We should tell someone." As if the conversation was private. Is this still top secret? Do they want our help or not? Shouldn't we be informed??? Shouldn't we prepare???

<br><br>

If <b>The Void Within</b> is projected to kick off in Q2 2024, that puts us in an interesting spot, schedule-wise. Q2 2024 is April, May, and June. We've already discussed how that complicates the annual events that happen around that time. But not only do we have a bunch of events around that time, we have basically nothing annual before that time. Q2 is packed, but Q1 is an arctic wasteland for content. Always has been. Well, there's the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopies/">Neopies</a>, but that doesn't really lend itself towards plot prologue like we've been getting over the past couple of months. So if there are no opportunities for all of Q1 for more plot prologue, that then leads us to Q2, when this thing is scheduled to start. We might not hear more about this plot until it actually starts happening. And there go Orion, Reina, and Fyora, to go prepare without us. Without so much as a warning. Unless the visions were for everyone at Winter Starlight. But if our heroes are going off in preparations without us, we can only advise that you do what you can to stay on guard against tentacle gods. When next we meet, this thing might be on.

We'll see you in the new year. Man, it would really be fitting of Orion was the Unfortunate Holiday Ogrin.

It looks... very very bad for our Faellie friend. The Aisha holds the Faellie's body, their heart rent that this Faellie is... gone now. <img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/sad.gif"> And so the stars in heaven are rent as much as the Aisha's heart. A rift in spacetime opens. Visions within visions, we see Brightvale. We see a mysterious someone in Brightvale, clutching a mysterious Paint Brush. We see a dark swath painted from Castle Brightvale to where the mysterious someone is standing. The Paint Brush smouldering with some kind of... evil exhaust? The Aisha, beholding this, asks "Can that really be home?"

<br><br><li>Wow. As we said yesterday, new ground. One struggles to recall a moment in Neopian history more affecting. But you could choose to hold out hope. Maybe the Aisha is wrong, after all, the tentacle thing turned the Aisha purple too! Why should the Aisha survive but not the Faellie??? Just give it time! Surely the Faellie is just sleeping! Lil'uns need lots of sleep!!! <img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/mrcoconut.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/cry.gif"><br><br>

Are we sure <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop</a> said "faerie" and not "Faellie?" Because that was a pretty heartfelt moment, in that people felt it in their hearts. There's an outpouring of grief on <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162824952">Board 7</a> for the Faellie. But whatever happened to this Faellie, whether they make it or not, keep these emotions you feel alive. They only mean you are compassionate and motivated to see good prevail. And that's what we're gonna need now. Perhaps more than ever.

<br><br>

The Aisha asks "What did you do?" They seem about as confused as we are, even though we saw what the Faellie did: They built this wrist device, affixed it to the Aisha, and then closed their eyes. First things first, this probably confirms that no, the Faellie did not originally know how to make whatever this wrist device is. Or the Aisha didn't know the Faellie knew that. We can infer from "What did you do" that the Aisha either means "What is this thing you put on my arm" or "I know what this device on my arm is, but how did you put it together?" Yes, it seems like grappling with the tentacle thing has blessed and/or cursed the Faellie with the power or insight to build things like... whatever this wrist device is.

<br><br>

But what is the device? "I know you saved me somehow" says the Aisha. Implying this act of sacrifice is specifically the thing that saved the Aisha's life. So is the wrist device what saved the Aisha? <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=neoryuuko">Neoryuuko</a> suggests that the device is some kind of suppressant/exhaust system for the dark energies flowing through the Aisha. Notice how it beeps louder and emits that violet radiation when the Aisha's emotions become too powerful. The Aisha has this device, and the Faellie does not. So... if it felt unfair that the Aisha gets to live and the Faellie doesn't, this might explain why. <img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/sad.gif"> If the Aisha was saved by the device itself. 

<br><br>

Still don't know why she's missing a glove. Guess she just lost it in the struggle of being in this place, like she lost other parts of her outfit.

<br><br>

And then there's that rift in space. A rift that shows Brightvale. And the Aisha asks "Can that really be home?" But is the Aisha surprised that a rift opened at all? That a rift opened, but it opened on Brightvale? Or does the Aisha not recognize the sight of Brightvale? Or a combination of these??? This also ties into speculations on what the wrist device is and whether or not the Aisha knows. <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=nathanael311">Nathanael311</a> raises an interesting question: Did the mystery device create the rift, or did the Aisha create the rift with new inherent powers they got from their fight with the tentacle thing? If the Aisha isn't surprised by the creation of the rift, that means she has an explanation for where it came from. Which probably means the device created the rift, the Aisha and Faellie brought this device with them, it broke in the crash but the Faellie repaired it, and now it's functioning as they expected. Maybe they brought the device here specifically to power it with what can be found here. But if the Aisha IS surprised by the creation of the rift, that means they have as much explanation as we do and everything is up for debate. It might even be that the Aisha knows what the device is, but doesn't understand how it can be working. Doesn't understand that they are now powering the device.

<br><br>

And about that rift, is it just a rift, or is it a portal? Most people seem to lean toward it being a full blown portal/wormhole, not just a rift you can spy through. <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=kh2riku_3">KH2Riku_3</a> explains: Remember Bythons? They're capable of interstellar travel. And by default they're covered in purple splotches. Now the Aisha is covered in purple splotches. Maybe the way Bythons get around through space is with wormholes. If you're gonna move faster than light, you probably need to warp through wormholes and portals. So that would mean the Aisha can now make portals like Bythons would. But does that then also mean the Aisha doesn't need the device to make rifts? Bythons probably don't need devices to travel across the stars, we didn't see them wearing any devices during the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a>. And if they do carry the Void's "taint," their alien biology probably means they don't need a wrist device like the Aisha does to stay alive. But the beeping, it reached maximum pitch right before the rift opened. Kinda seems like the device was channeling the energies in the Aisha to make the rift. The device was definitely working on something, beeping harder means working harder for machines. Whether it was working to create a rift or working to keep the Aisha from experiencing... let's call it "Void Toxicity." And if this Aisha is the character from the teaser image, note how it's only the wrist with the device on it that emits the energy. Implying that it's the device itself that is the conduit for these powers.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/db6qPDU.png" width="450" alt="It's not coming out of the other hand, see?" title="It's not coming out of the other hand, see?"><br><br>

What seems to be pretty clear though is, you can't make rifts without the power that exists here. Either the Aisha can make them organically now, or the power within the Aisha lets the wrist device make them. <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=smudgeoffudge">SmudgeOfFudge</a> sees the Void as a "Living Force," and speculates that the Aisha can now commune with it. That the Void is intelligent. That The Void represents potential, and will reflect what's <b>within</b> someone. If you dream of home and togetherness, the Void will create portals. If you dream of weapons, the Void will... give you a purple sword and a three pronged dagger. Anger forms outlets for anger. Love forms outlets for love. Which brings us back to the question of why the Aisha and Faellie even went here. And whether or not the Aisha knows what the device is, or is surprised that a portal opened. If they ended up here accidentally, then sure. But if they came here on purpose, that would imply they know what the power here is capable of. Or have some idea of what it might be capable of. And look around, the caves are decked out with minerals. Riku would like to remind everyone of Monty McTaggart of Moltara Obsidian.

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/faeriefestival/2023/np/characters/MontySmugRight.png" width="450" alt="Unwitting pawn in the tentacle thing's aim to corrupt Neopia?" title="Unwitting pawn in the tentacle thing's aim to corrupt Neopia?"><br><br>

Remember how Illusen wanted to talk up an alternative energy to obsidian? What if he's hip to the crystals in this mysterious place? What if this Aisha works for Moltara Obsidian and was sent to prospect a pocket for mining? People have also been talking about <a href="//www.neopets.com/moon/mining.phtml">Kreludan Mining Corp</a> coming into play, and the Aisha is wearing a Virtupets button. Maybe the Aisha is from Kreludan Mining? Where ever the Aisha came from, maybe the mission was planned with the knowledge that there is a place somewhere with the power to make miracles. 

<br><br>

The Aisha may or may not have expected a portal to open. But even if they were expecting a portal to open, they're still surprised at the sight of Brightvale. So why would they be, disregarding the portal aspect? Maybe they're just grateful to be back? The description of <b>Returning to Neopia</b> reads <b>We missed you very much!! This was given out by the Advent Calendar in Y25.</b> If the items and their descriptions mean anything, maybe this means the Aisha has been gone very long, friends and family didn't know when they were coming home. And this is a Brightvale far removed from the Brightvale she recognizes. But it probably has something to do with what's framed in the portal. We see a mysterious someone just out of frame, holding the second mysterious Paint Brush so far in this saga. And it's been used on Brightvale. Thought Brightvale might not look too unrecognizable right now, the sight of this Paint all over the road would probably intrigue.

<br><br>

But y'know what's intriguing all by itself? The idea that a portal should appear in Brightvale. Portals in Brightvale? What a coincidence, we <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/brightvaleMiniEvent/faq.phtml">did this already</a>. With Magon. The evidence continues to pile up for his involvement in this. For good or evil. He was working on portals to the future at the time, remember? What if this is, retroactively, one of the portals he makes? Maybe his project wasn't such a failure after all??? But wait, this being a portal to the future from Magon's perspective back during Trouble in Brightvale, that would also make this a portal to the day Trouble in Brightvale happened. And as far as we know, no one was painting with a mysterious Paint Brush that day. So... maybe this person was painting in secret? Or maybe this just wasn't one of the portals Magon made. Regardless, it's too coincidental for us to be dealing with a portal to Brightvale and have Magon just not show up at all in this. Did the power of the Void help him make his portals in the first place? His portals were and still are powered by whatever the Aisha and/or their wrist device are powered by? Or... could he be the one wielding the Paint Brush? It looks sinister. And if anyone has a motive to hurt Brightvale somehow, it's Magon. Has he turned to villainy in mad revenge for being persecuted? But then... this person is wearing different clothes than Magon usually does. Yes, Magon has been known to wear different clothes. But it's usually robes. This character looks like they're wearing... maybe armor, or a fancy jacket. 

<br><br>

Might Magon command the person wielding the Paint Brush? A la Malkus commanding Balthazar? A captain in this organization Vira and her faerie mistress are in? <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=_hermes_32">_Hermes_32</a> thinks it might be Xandra. This person's hair is about as long.

<br><br>

So that's two Paint Brushes so far, it seems. What does each one do differently from the other? People are noting how this one looks a lot more like Vira than the other Brush she's supposedly related to. But consider this theory from Neoryuuko: They're the same brush. It's just originally we saw it in shadow or something. Or it can change its skin or something. Dare to compare.


<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/smxfYfj.png" alt="Another mystery hidden in silhouette?" title="Another mystery hidden in silhouette?"></center>

<br><br>

So if Hermes is right about this being Xandra, that would put her on the same team as a wicked faerie. Which would be ironic if nothing else. But if we're dealing with a plot about people being led astray with dark temptation, maybe Xandra was tempted. Tempted with words like "Don't worry, this faerie is cool and agrees with you that faeries should do more for Neopets. She's going to help you achieve your justice." Although to even begin with that, someone would have to unpetrify Xandra. And this still leaves the question of what exactly this Paint Brush does. Can it change form or something?

<br><br><b>To Be Continued</b> seems to imply that this is it for Orion's visions, for now. Fitting, as the Faerie Festival comic and the Advent Calendar comic both end on the sight of mysterious Paint Brushes, Brushes that might be one and the same, not just wielded by the same evil team. We've got a cutscene scheduled tomorrow, so it's about time for the visions to end. Time for Reina to react to what we all saw. Maybe we'll get confirmation that the Aisha from the visions is Reina's mom? They also say Fyora is gonna make an appearance. You know who would probably have to show up if Xandra got loose? Fyora. Seems the counterattack can finally begin. Let us hope. Maybe these are visions of the future and they haven't happened yet? Maybe we can stop the Faellie from going on this doomed mission?

And whatever it is, it seems to be spreading even faster through the Faellie. The Aisha, presumably after the encounter with the tentacle thing, takes a nap. Soldier that they are, the Faellie takes this opportunity to go searching for tools and parts. Like one of Santa's own helpers they repair some sort of... wrist module, don't know what it does, but they finish it just in time for whatever effect the tentacle thing has to saturate throughout their little Faellie body. Somehow they affix it to their Aisha friend's wrist, and then collapse.

<br><br>

The Aisha wakes to the sound of their wrist... thing... and the sight of a now very still, very purple Faellie.

<br><br><li>Now we're talkin'. Death is not unheard of in plots, sure. Villains die, we saw Xandra kìll Nox in <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tfr/">The Faeries' Ruin</a>. The good also die, but it's usually offscreen and often years removed from the present. Like Nurse Lucy of <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/hwp/solution.phtml#puzzle8">The Meepit Oaks Sanitorium for the Psychologically Fragile</a>. Tragic as her story was, it was relegated to journal pages written long ago, and we don't even know the full extent of what happened to her. But if this little Faellie does not pull through, it'll probably be the first time in a plot that we see, with our own eyes, as it happens, a non-villain give into their wounds and die. And it couldn't have happened to a gentler, less deserving creature. This is a Petpet! They're not supposed to get caught up in the evil that Neopets do! They're not supposed to be responsible for our mistakes! But this Faellie stepped up where petkind failed, if for nothing else but the saved life of their Aisha friend. Hearts are breaking <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162820564">left</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162822531">right</a> on Board 7. The plot hasn't even begun proper, but now we've got stakes. Now we're talkin'.

<br><br>

Let's reflect then, on the deeds of this little Faellie that could. The wrist device, what is it? Some kind of communicator? Occam's Razor would probably say that it's some kind of communicator or beacon. Fix the broken communicator, relay that you need evac, you and your Faellie get outta where ever this is. On the other hand, what if they're too far out to communicate with their mission control team? They might not even be in outer space, they might be in another dimension or someone's subconscious. On the OTHER other hand, if they went to this place on purpose surely they intended to be able to reach their team when they got here. If it's not a communicator, what else could it be? Maybe a super suit comes out of it? We still don't know why this Aisha has a bare hand/wrist. Seems like this device originally went there, but would a glove have interfered with a mere communicator? Maybe whatever this device is necessitates having a bare hand and wrist. Maybe it's some kind of Fitbit/health &amp; activity tracker? Also, if it's not a communicator, how are they getting out of here? Maybe it's an emergency teleporter (in case the vessel they came here in fails) and it needs skin contact to work? Whatever it is, may we get answers as to why the Aisha's hand and wrist are bare. If originally all there was on it was that device. Because if the Aisha and the silhouetted character from the teaser are the same character (very surprising if not), then it would appear that the "void glove" was never a glove at all. It was a bare hand, and the "girth" around the wrist is the device.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/db6qPDU.png" width="450" alt="It was always a bare hand." title="It was always a bare hand."><br><br>

Is it the hand that creates the void particles? Or is it the device? <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=kh2riku_3">KH2Riku_3</a> speculates that the device is specifically powered by the void energy found in this place. Making it some kind of "void device" or something and they came here to get "batteries" for it or something. Or maybe it only works if you get turned purple, and that's why it's powering on now? It's touching the "infected" skin of the Aisha?

<br><br>

Also? Take note of the Aisha's chest armor. In the first panel, it's intact. But in all subsequent appearances, it's broken. What broke it? Did the Faellie break it for parts to fix the device with? Or, because these are psychic visions, maybe there are little inconsistencies that are par for the course? Remember how back during the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a>, Mira was doubtful of the imprecision of magic psychic divination powers, compared to reliable and systematic scientific method? Makes you then wonder how much of this is real.

<br><br>

Know what's unreal? How much this Faellie knows about repairing sophisticated tech. Did the Faellie always know this? Maybe, probably. Like we said on the 26th, the Faellie probably has to have some kind of talent to bring to the table just to be on this mission. But maybe making contact with the tentacle thing changed the Faellie in such a way as to give them unnatural savvy in fixing machines? Maybe they woke up and realized "Oh wow, I 'get' machines now?" Whatever the tentacle thing has done to this Faellie, let's hope it's better than it is worse. After all, the Aisha came in contact with the tentacle thing too and the Aisha is... well, they're not dead? So all things fair and square, the Faellie should just be sleepy like the Aisha was just sleepy, right? And the Faellie will wake up like the Aisha did and realize that they're now much purpler than usual. So if you can live after being purpled by the tentacle thing, does being purple have any sort of special effect on you? Recall that this "will be an interesting plot when it comes to color." Color is important and meaningful, ergo the Faellie and Aisha being purple will be a factor somehow. But on the other hand, Vira and her faerie mistress have a Paint Brush. A Paint Brush that probably has some kinda similar effect on people as this tentacle thing. So depending on who they intend to use this Paint Brush on, it might be to your detriment to be purpled by the tentacle thing. 

<br><br>

In fact... maybe that's what <b>The Void Within</b> is. Maybe getting purpled means having a void put <b>within</b> you and there's a void now in the Aisha and Faellie? And it's bad for that void to be there, whatever a "void" is specifically? And we'll have to save this Aisha and Faellie from themselves? <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=_hermes_32">Hermes</a> has a feeling that the Aisha and Faellie will start to be controlled by the tentacle thing, because the tentacle thing imparted its blessing/curse upon them. <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=textfraud">TextFraud</a> takes it a step further: He suspects that by December 30th, the Void's hold on the Faellie will be complete, and manifest itself fully through the Faellie. Maybe having a "void" is what turns a faerie Grey, or an Acara into Vira. Meaning this Faellie is going to evolve even further. 

<br><br>

If color is a factor in this plot, how much attention should we be paying to it? And how should it be paid? The Aisha and Faellie (especially the Faellie) are turning purple with white sparkles. So is purple and white a color scheme we should point out when we see it? Because as mentioned before, Magon and the Bythons fly those colors. It's this chapter that shows us just how similar the Faellie and Magon's cloak look. If color is important, it would be hard to ignore the question of what Magon might be up to right now. To say nothing of his claim to being an expert on things interdimensional. And what about these Advent Calendar prizes we're getting? They're purple with sparkles, are they of any importance? <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=pokepets924">PokePets924</a> thinks so. He theorizes that these weapons, in one way or another, are designed to be particulary effective in defending against the tentacle thing and the forces that threaten Neopia now. If this is so, we can look at these items and get an idea for what our enemy is made of. In the same way you can look at a Geraptiku Fly Trap and learn what Geraptiku Flies are susceptible to.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_power_of_friendship.gif" alt="With the power of friendship, you can defeat any enemy!

<br><br><b>The Power of Friendship</b> hits for 2.6 icons each for Air, Fire, Water, Earth, and Light. For a total of 13 icons. No Dark, and no Physical. So you might infer from this that throwing Dark or Physical at our enemy will probably not be very effective. They probably block a lot of Dark and/or Physical. Makes sense for eldritch horrors from the void to be immune to darkness. <b>Holiday Memories</b> is a Once Per Battle healer and blocker. Heals you for 20% of your max HP, and block 100% of all Dark, Fire, and Physical icons. So if we're meant to consider taking Holiday Memories into battle against these void forces, if it's designed to protect us specifically from those bad guys, those bad guys probably throw around a lot of Dark, Physical, and Fire. Ah, now a pattern is starting to form. An enemy that throws around Dark and Physical (and Fire), and is also immune/protected againsr Dark and Physical. 

<br><br>

But we didn't get any voidy/purple-with-sparkles items today. So do these prizes have no significance? <b>Holiday Running Shoes</b> might tie into how our heroes are running for their lives. But what could <b>Christmas Contacts</b> mean, if anything?

Two more days, as far as we know. Up next we're probably gonna see what that wrist device does. And if these purple prizes are meant to protect us from the Void, a few more of those would be welcome too.

<br><ul><li>Hope you didn't take "The final cutscene of the year is on December 30th" to mean you were done watching until then. There are still more visions! And... oh goodness, what's <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/adventcalendar.phtml">THAT</a>???

It's not clear if this chapter immediately follows the last chapter, but it sure lines up nicely. The Faellie finds themself lured in by what appears to be... an eldritch horror from beyond the stars. "Somewhere in the universe." The Aisha rushes in to save the Faellie. There's a considerable struggle, and in exchange for the Faellie, the Aisha loses some of their clothes. They flee to a cave for safety, but the Faellie... oh the Faellie... is looking a lot purpler than usual. <img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/sad.gif"><br><br>

Is Vira's faerie mistress really taking credit for all this?

<br><br><li>Things are really ramping up, so before we get to speculation let's go over what we know...

<br><br>

1. <b>First, Neopia has known the scourge of villainy many times in its history. <a href="//www.neopets.com/evil/showcreature.phtml?villain=1">Dr. Sloth</a> has been a constant threat. <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=121">Balthazar</a> keeps the faeries bottled. The likes of <a href="//www.neopets.com/desert/crown_solution.phtml">Malkus Vile</a> and the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=131">Shadow Usul</a> can be presumed to get up to things. <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=253">The Three</a> corrupted the mind of General Kass and convinced to take the name <a href="//www.neopets.com/evil/showcreature.phtml?villain=16">Lord Kass</a> and re-instigate <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/bfm_warroom.phtml">war with Meridell</a>. <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=263">Captain Scarblade</a> once <a href="//www.neopets.com/water/plot_com.phtml?chapter=1">terrorized Maraqua</a> and now lives to terrorize the rest of Neopia's seas. <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tfr/">Xandra</a> brought <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tfr/">Ruin</a> to Faerieland. <a href="//www.neopets.com/evil/showcreature.phtml?villain=27">The Darkest Faerie</a> has started a few crises of her own, and was last seen <a href="//images.neopets.com/twr/theclearing/finale.mp4">running off while wearing a ring that was draining her of life</a>. <a href="//www.neopets.com/evil/showcreature.phtml?villain=13">Vira</a>, originally a victim of a evil temptation, has been going offering others evil temptations. <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=179">Jennumara</a> once held captive a Grey Faerie named Baelia.</b>

<br><br>

2. <b>The Void Within will involve a sci-fi looking 'pet that's probably an Aisha and probably wears a special glove, will involve a certain faerie and a story long overdue for a resolution, will involve many places and people including people and places we haven't seen before, and it will be an interesting plot when it comes to color.</b>

<br><br><br><br>

3. <b>A mysterious tower appeared in <a href="//www.neopets.com/magma/index.phtml">Moltara</a>, spewing pollutants.</b>

<br><br><br><br>

4. <b>During the last <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a>, Mira the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=41">Space Faerie</a> presented us with some eggs she found in deep space. Everyone was very intrigued about what the eggs actually were. Festival host <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/neggery.phtml">Kari</a> goes looking for people who can figure the mystery out.</b>
<br><br>
5. <b><a href="//www.neopets.com/space/coincidence.phtml">Professor Landelbrot</a> showed up to help, and while he had valuable contributions he couldn't tell us what the eggs were.</b>
<br><br>
6. <b><a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=305">Magon</a> showed up to help, he insisted the eggs were <a href="//www.neopets.com/tcg/displayCard.phtml?edid=3&amp;id=28">Giant Space Fungus</a> Spores and should be destroyed immediately. Mira, being the Space Faerie, doubted Magon's theory. His wishes went ignored.</b>
<br><br>
7. <b><a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/sfc/">Tippens</a> introduced us to Orion. Orion suggests using tarot cards to figure out what the eggs are. In conjunction with conventional science of course. Around the same time Orion showed up, Magon left the Festival for who knows where. He left without a word.</b>
<br><br>
8. <b>Everyone (except Magon because he left) works together and the mystery of the eggs is uncovered: They're space serpents that Mira decided to name "Bythons.</b>
<br><br>
9. <b>The Festival of Neggs ends on a satisfying note. Mira reveals that she plans on hanging planetside for a while longer, as <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/earthfaerie.phtml">Illusen</a> has brought to her attention a small crisis of atmospheric pollution in Neopia lately.</b>

<br><br><br><br>

10. <b>Later in the year, the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faeriefestival/index.phtml">Faerie Festival</a> happens. The objective, deal with the pollution issue in Neopia nowadays. Illusen and <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/darkfaerie.phtml">Jhudora</a> are called to co-host, but their mutual hurt feelings for one another keep them from working together. They hold separate Festivals.</b>
<br><br>
11. <b>Illusen seems to have developed a cough. Concerning.</b>
<br><br>
12. <b>On separate quests to achieve the same goal of saving Neopia's environment, Jhudora and Illusen decide (with separate aims in mind) to visit the Moltara Obsidian Company. AKA, that mysterious tower we've been waiting to learn more about.</b>
<br><br>
13. <b>Monty McTaggart, Moltara's Magnanimous Obsidian Magnate, is strongarmed into revealing that <a href="//www.neopets.com/desert/crown_solution.phtml">Malkus Vile</a> is majority investor for his startup energy business.</b>
<br><br>
14. <b>Jhudora tracks down Vile. They talk about how Neopia's Industrial Revolution is causing Earth and Water Faeries to get sick. Vile says this is a perfect opportunity to take Illusen out of the picture. Vile says he's got a man on the job already. But Jhudora is fighting feelings for Illusen and can't let harm come to her. Vile adds that, whether Jhudora wants Illusen rubbed out or not, there are machinations at work beyond even this. This is only step one of a larger endeavor. Jhudora demands answers or she'll put a hole in Vile's head. Vile bargains for his life by revealing that Illusen is about to be bottled and that Jhudora can save her if she acts now.</b>
<br><br>
15. <b>Illusen and her Glade are weak now for the pollution's effect on the world. <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=121">Balthazar</a> gets the drop on her and reveals that he is Vile's man and could get paid a lot of 'points to bring her in, but Balthazar feels like finishing Illusen himself. But before he can, Jhudora shows up and immolates him in her fire.</b>
<br><br>
16. <b>Vile is apprehended by the faeries, Jhudora and Illusen offer stopgap measures to clean Neopia up. So the Festivals were a success, to some extent. But as for the larger endeavor, Vile won't reveal who he's working for. Not even if Jhudora puts a hole in his head. <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=234">Fyora</a> tells everyone not to worry about it right now, but secretly she's very worried. She has grave suspicions.</b>
<br><br>
17. <b>We see <a href="//www.neopets.com/evil/showcreature.phtml?villain=13">Vira</a> and a mysterious cloaked faerie, taking credit as the force behind Vile and Monty (and Balthazar if we're counting everybody). The cloaked faerie has done this to herald her return and plant dread in the minds of those who recognize her signature. They're also in possession of a dark, voidy looking Paint Brush. There is much for Vira and her faerie mistress to do. We can consider this the first "chapter" of The Void Within.</b>

<br><br><br><br>

18. <b>Halloween comes, and we get 7 stories involving 7 villains. Sloth, Shadow Usul, The Three, Captain Scarblade, Xandra, The Darkest Faerie, and Vira. In the <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2023-10-30">New Features</a> we are encouraged to pay close attention to at least Vira's, because <a href="//www.neopets.com/tcg/displayCard.phtml?edid=11&amp;id=66">Reginald</a> doesn't remember including it. The book, unlike all the others, is turning Grey.</b>

<br><br><br><br>

19. <b><a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/wintercelebration.phtml">Winter Starlight</a> comes, and Orion returns. He tries to interrupt the fun because he's been having these prophetic nightmares lately. He was pondering his cards, when some mysterious music led him to an even mysteriouser lyre in the snow. And since then, like Fyora before him, he can't shake the fear that something is coming for Neopia. But unlike Fyora, Orion seems to want to raise the alarm for all of us. Reina, keeper of the <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/adventcalendar.phtml">Advent Calendar</a>, doesn't consider nightmares to be cause to cancel Christmas.</b>
<br><br>
20. <b>Keeping the Advent Calendar is a family business, but Reina's mother opted for a <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/advents_past.phtml?year=2023&amp;day=23">different, undisclosed path</a>.</b>
<br><br>
21. <b>Orion finds a way to share his visions with us through the power of the lyre. We see a bluish Aisha and a pink Faellie adrift in some dark place "somewhere in the universe." Seems like there was some kind of accident that brought them there. For some reason the Aisha only wears one glove. We see the Aisha and Faellie beset by shadowy things. We see the Aisha and Faellie run through a place where the sword of Lord Kass is resting. We see the Faellie tempted by the lure of a dark, tentacled abomination. We see the tentacled abomination attack the Aisha and Faellie. We see the Aisha and Faellie resting in a cave, the Faellie is not doing too well.</b>

<br><br><br><br>

And now, here we are. Where things are looking a lot more Lovecraftian if you ask <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162820134">Board 7</a>. This thing, it works for Vira's faerie mistress??? Hard to imagine this thing answering to anyone. And this faerie says she's "returning?" Implying that she's thrown power around like this before, maybe? This is the sort of force she deals in? If the "Tentacle Creature to The Three to Kass" pipeline is real then that means this thing has affected Neopia in the past. Maybe constantly throughout its history. Cosmic tentacled presence that can reach into your mind? Drive you insane? Or maybe haunt you with visions and keep you from sleeping in Orion's case? Yes, Lovecraftian indeed. Maybe that's the significance of the <b>Holiday Memories</b> prize? <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=textfraud">TextFraud</a> certainly took notice. The Faellie was even lured, literally lured, by the tentacle creature using some kind of... angler apparatus. So the themes of being controlled/affected by higher powers are prevalent. And with that as a frame of reference it's hard to imagine anyone being the boss of this creature. If it's a godlike entity living <b>within</b> your thoughts and memories and can control you through those. If it's the void <b>within</b> us all. So maybe this faerie is just using this creature's power, same as how Xandra "used" the wraiths. They were a power she could not predict or control, really.

<br><br>

The Aisha and the Faellie escaped this thing at some cost. Panic is already setting, Neopia doesn't like when the Petpets suffer. What actually happened to that Faellie will be one of the more important questions we need answered. But also, the Aisha's glove. The Aisha wears one glove, and the character from the original <b>The Void Within</b> teaser image appears to be an Aisha with a special glove. Emitting voidy bloops or whatever.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/db6qPDU.png" width="450" alt="Isaac Clarke had a special glove of sorts, too." title="Isaac Clarke had a special glove of sorts, too."><br><br>

Maybe it's a special glove? Maybe it's a bare hand? If the Aisha with the one glove and the character in silhouette are the same (and it would be very surprising by now if they weren't), what does this voidy bloop hand do? Was the Aisha always able to make these bloops? Did they come to this voidy place to do voidy bloop hand stuff? Or did visiting the void give them voidy bloop hand powers? Perhaps something they gained after their encounter with the tentacle thing? <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=kh2riku_3">KH2Riku_3</a> seems to think so. The silhouette does look like an Aisha, but not <i>exactly</i> like our hero with the Faellie. For one, the silhouette looks like its wearing two gloves, not one. Maybe encounters with the tentacle thing change you physically as well as mentally. And if the Aisha transforms, surely the Faellie will start to transform. They look like they took the brunt of the damage. If that Faellie survives, surely there must be some effect the tentacle thing has on it that we'll see in the next chapter? If there is one?

<br><br>

Now that we're dealing with some kind of eldritch horror that's probably from some higher plane, a lot more consideration is paid toward whether or not portals of some kind are a factor. The Aisha and Faellie, did they go through a portal in yesterday's comic? A portal that brought them to this place with the tentacle creature? If portals are involved, could Magon be involved somehow? <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=kh2riku_3">KH2Riku_3</a> points out that in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a>, Magon has ditched his royal red for something in purple and white.

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neggfest/y25/characters/MagonCuriousLeft.png" width="450" alt="Who needs King Hagan anyway?" title="Who needs King Hagan anyway?"><br><br>

Know what else is purple and white? Bythons. A color scheme perhaps meant to match the Void? Even the smoke is purple. What is that smoke, anyway?

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neggfest/y25/np/negganimation.gif" width="450" alt="Throwforward to Advent Calendar 2023, Day 15" title="Throwforward to Advent Calendar 2023, Day 15"><br><br>

So if Bythons are related to <b>The Void Within</b>, is Magon related somehow to Bythons? Did he know more than he was letting on? Why was he the only one who left so abruptly? To that you might ask "Would that make the Bythons dangerous? Are they heralds of the tentacle thing? If Magon knew that, why wouldn't he just reveal all that he knew? Why would he let on less than the whole truth?" Maybe Magon had reason to fear the watchful eye of the creature, or Vira's faerie mistress? And he had to obfuscate the full extent of his knowledge to ensure that the Bythons were destroyed and it looked like an accident? He did at least claim to be an "authority mystical" on things from different realms. This tentacle creature looks like its from a different realm. 

<br><br>

Or maybe Magon left because, as usual, he isn't getting the respect he thinks he's entitled to. But that might be reason for him to get involved with this too. If a theme here is people tempted and manipulated by dark forces, and some led to evil like Vira, Magon has more motive than most. As of today, if you visit <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/brightvale.phtml">Brightvale</a> you'll still find the FAQ link for the event that introduced Magon way back in 2018: <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/brightvaleMiniEvent/faq.phtml">Trouble in Brightvale</a>. The story was, King Hagan put Magon in charge of a special project: Invent a time portal to the future. Unprecedented stuff. Inherently unpredictable because of that. It had never been done. We have <a href="//www.neopets.com/mall/shop.phtml#load_items_pane-browse-121">chronomobiles</a>, yes. But not portals to the future. And so you're gonna run into unforseen complications. Like portals popping up in random places. Now, Hagan could've said "We don't know enough about this to safely continue the project. Shutter it until we have the knowledge to pursue this thing safely." But he didn't. He said "Make me my time portal in a week and do it perfectly or face charges in the Court of Knowledge." This thing that no one had ever done, therefore no one knows how to do it. But Hagan demands it be done somehow or Magon will be punished. And if you were there, you can still see the end result on the Brightvale map page.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/PwAs6KB.png" width="450" alt="This is it! This is how it all ends! I am expected to stop all efforts on my dear, beloved project, and hand over all my work to the king while I face charges for 'insensitive handling of sensitive research' and 'prolonged studies with poor results'. All this, in the kingdom of Brightvale, which claims to be the best place for scholars of every kind! Bah!" title="This is it! This is how it all ends! I am expected to stop all efforts on my dear, beloved project, and hand over all my work to the king while I face charges for 'insensitive handling of sensitive research' and 'prolonged studies with poor results'. All this, in the kingdom of Brightvale, which claims to be the best place for scholars of every kind! Bah!"><br><br>

He meant so well for us. And the dream falls apart in his hands. "Prolonged studies with poor results." Isn't that like Hagan? To hold people to impossible standards? He really is just as stubborn and obtuse as Skarl, but in the other direction. Hagan's mad because the portal experiment leaked? Because Magon couldn't do it perfectly the first or second time? That was not out of any neglect from Magon. That was, again, because of the uncertain nature of time portals. There's no way to know how they'll act because this is the first time anyone tried to make one. But an unreasonable ruler wouldn't care about these things. An unreasonable ruler would say "This is Brightvale, we have the smartest people, therefore I won't tolerate failure even in the absolutely unpredictable. Failure gets punishment." 

<br><br>

Heartbreaking for any young scholar. But Magon seems to be particularly proud and sure of himself if you hear him talk about himself. Like during his <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=305">trial</a>. He considered his project to be "the most altruistic project ever in Neopia." During the Bython investigation, he was not shy about insisting that he couldn't be wrong about the Bython eggs. And to that point, how off was he? He said they were Giant Space Fungus Spores. If the Bythons and the tentacle creature are related, it should be noted that Giant Space Fungi kinda sorta look like the tentacle creature. In that they're both round with many tentacles.

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/dome/npcs/00211_ea41c92694_giantspacefungus/default_211.png" width="450" alt="A little less H.P. Lovecraft, a little more Douglas Adams?" title="A little less H.P. Lovecraft, a little more Douglas Adams?"><br><br>

But no one would see it his way. Is it so hard to believe he wouldn't stay where he isn't wanted? Is it so hard to believe that after two high profile embarrassments, he might find himself persuaded by someone saying "Hey I know whatcha want and I got whatcha need?" As it was for Vira? So maybe Magon is involved in this the same way Vira is. We speculated we might be dealing with a coven of faeries, maybe each faerie has a team of soldiers organized by rank, like Vira's mistress has Vira, and Vile is ranked lower than Vira, and Balthazar is a contracted freelancer for Vile, and so on. Maybe Magon is under some other faerie's wing. Maybe he's under the same faerie Vira is. There might be a whole org chart detailing the makeup of this coven. Although if everyone's under the tentacle creature, we might consider it less of a coven and more of a cult. In keeping with the Lovecraftian angle.

<br><br>

If nothing else, this seems like a field Magon would be interested in. People are talking about this delving into the cosmic setting. That this might be some kind of multiverse-spanning crisis. As cosmic threats tend to be. Stuff from other realms is what Magon at least pretends to be an expert on. Maybe he doesn't actually know anything about Bythons, but he is the one who helps this coven/cult reach out and touch their tentacled god? 

<br><br>

Fyora is no longer the only one who knows what's coming. Which means she doesn't have to keep secrets anymore, hopefully we can start to collaborate with her on some kind of counterattack. Maybe she'll show up in the next cutscene? Our questions are many, any answers she might have would be invaluable. 3 more days. At the very least.

<br><br><li>And so it begins. The public at large, or at least the ones at <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/wintercelebration.phtml">Winter Starlight</a>, are now aware of <b>The Void Within</b>. Speculation is on once again at <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162817758">Board 7</a>.

<br><br>

From this, not only does it seem like this plot WILL involve outer space in some capacity (as previously speculated), but it looks like we might finally be seeing the 'pet behind the silhouette!

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/db6qPDU.png" width="450" alt="Gotta be an Aisha." title="Gotta be an Aisha."><br><br>

Kinda looks like the Aisha from the comic, right? Maybe without the helmet? The silhouette looks like it might be spacey? Well, this Aisha is spacey. The silhouette looks like it might be an Aisha? Well, this Aisha is an Aisha.

<br><br>

But who might this Aisha be? <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=sukind">Sukind</a> has an idea. You may or may not remember the Advent Calendar comic we got on <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/advents_past.phtml?year=2023&amp;day=23">December 23rd</a>? Featuring a young Reina talking to her Meemaw?

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/winter/advent/2023/23_13f558c0e2/Advent2023_23.png" width="450" alt="Portrait of the Advent Calendar dynasty." title="Portrait of the Advent Calendar dynasty."><br><br>

This had us wondering about the history of Winter Starlight and Reina's family regarding. But mostly, who is her mysterious mom who doesn't want in on the family business? <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=sukind">Sukind</a> asks if maybe this is a case of Chekhov's Mom? Ah? Reina's mom is the Aisha in question??? They're both bluish, even!

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mc2yR4f.png" width="450" alt="Bluish, greenish..." title="Bluish, greenish..."><br><br>

Maybe Reina gets her Christmassy hue from her dad's side of the family?

<br><br>

Reina's mom, if that is who she is, appears to be wearing some kind of Virtupets insignia. Maybe she up and joined the Resistance instead of serving up Christmas cheer? And somehow this has led her to the depths of space? To some sort of... <b>Void???</b> The irony if this is Reina's mom; Reina's spent the whole of Winter Starlight not really worrying about whatever Orion's seeing, imagine if it's her mom in peril! Moral of the story: Check on your family during the holidays.

<br><br>

The speculation from people like <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=marilynmansonrocks">MarilynMansonRocks</a>, that one of the places we're going to is outer space and the Bythons are some kind of key here is validated further now. For one, we see outer space as a setting now. And this spacey Aisha is out there engaging with "Voidy" looking dark entities, or... structures? But futher, the description of the Bython reveals that they can emit antimatter. It's tough to predict how antimatter will work, but usually when antimatter comes into contact with regular matter it creates "annihilations." Negations. Things get... "voided out," basically. Maybe Bythons are some kind of conduit to harnessing/weaponizing the Void of <b>The Void Within</b>? Maybe the Void is "within" the antimatter core/transfer apparatus of these Bythons?

<br><br>

Or maybe the Aisha isn't in "outer space," in the sense that most people mean. <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=gloomyhalloumi">GloomyHalloumi</a> raises the possibility that this might be an entirely different dimension. The Void Dimension, maybe? The setting named is "Somewhere in the Universe." That probably counts other dimensions, especially if you get there by wormhole or something. Usually you need a breathing apparatus to survive in outer space, and this Aisha's helmet is very destroyed. You're probably thinking "But if the Aisha is wearing a helmet at all, they must've gone somewhere where a helmet was expected to be necessary. The Aisha simply happens to have ended up where a helmet isn't necessary." Maybe this place where a helmet isn't necessary was the target destination all along? The Aisha had to travel through some place (like outer space) where you needed a helmet at first, and then end up where ever this comic is.

<br><br>

Or maybe the "void" is more metaphorical/psychological. Doesn't mean it's not real, plenty of things that are just in your mind have the ability to affect things physically. Orion and his psychic powers are proof of that. <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=kh2riku_3">KH2Riku_3</a> suggests that maybe <b>The Void Within</b> is <b>within</b> someone's mind. And that this Aisha is more of a "psychonaut." If this is a Baelia plot, perhaps she's got a void within herself that's a byproduct of the trauma that Greyed her? Maybe the villains from <b>Tales of Neovia</b> all have cores within them? Maybe Sloth himself has a core in him??? Maybe it's both things. Maybe the Void comes from space, a sinister energy that can be used on a person, and when it is used (like when you're turning them Grey) they develop a Void Within themselves? And Sloth was our first taste of that kind of energy and when we got it, Jennumara and/or Drakara decided they would get their hands on more???

<br><br>

And then there's the matter of what's actually happening in these visions. These images aren't necessarily connected, but we can assess what we see.

<br><br>

1. <b>The Aisha and the Faellie are adrift somewhere. A toolbox spills its parcel, bits of scrap also seem to be drifting. They appear to be in the center of some, sort of... region of spacetime.</b>
<br>
2. <b>Dark creatures with glowing eyes encroach on the Aisha and Faellie.</b>
<br>
3. <b>Grasping shadows encroach on the Aisha and Faellie. The Aisha and Faellie no longer wear their protective gear.</b>
<br>
4. <b>The Aisha and Faellie start running off panel across floating rocks. A finely decorated sword stands in one of those floating rocks.</b>

<br><br>

What it SEEMS like is, there was some kind of accident/disaster. Probably due to something faulty in some kind of ship, hence the tools. The Aisha was in the middle of fixing it, probably. And then there was catastrophic failure that left the Aisha and Faellie lost "somewhere in the universe." Somewhere where they're threatened by shadows. It very well could be that 2nd, 3rd, and 4th panels are an entirely different place from the first. Maybe our heroes got dragged into another... dimension or something... to where there are swords stuck in stones and shadow creatures?

<br><br>

Speaking of that sword in the stone, it looks familiar, doesn't it?

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/oDATpRi.png" width="450" alt="Medieval fantasy sword in a sci-fi setting?" title="Medieval fantasy sword in a sci-fi setting?"><br><br>

Know what that sword looks like? The blade of legend that Lord Kass wielded. Pretty sure it's called "Naralus," but Fan Sites seem to disagree right now.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_kass_sword.gif" alt="Some are saying this blade is actually called Trithduril, and Kass's dagger is what's named Naralus." title="Some are saying this blade is actually called Trithduril, and Kass's dagger is what's named Naralus."></center>
<br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/frontpage/bfmplot_13a.gif" alt="Kass holding his weapon, whatever its name is." title="Kass holding his weapon, whatever its name is."></center>

<br><br>

Kass was a known pawn of The Three. And The Three? Well they're in <b>Tales of Neovia</b>! So how did his sword get up there, or in there, where ever this is? If The Three gave Kass Naralus, and The Three are connected to The Void, maybe The Void can create or summon things like Naralus? Maybe it can create/summon anything and everything related to the villains in its network? Maybe this place in space is where Kass himself is right now?

<br><br>

And while we're looking at this Aisha, is that some kind of marking on their forehead?

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2V3zXqJ.png" alt="Maybe just hair mixed with lens flare." title="Maybe just hair mixed with lens flare."></center>

<br><br>

Know who else has forehead markings like that? Alien Aishas.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/alienaisha.gif" alt="Pointing up" title="Pointing up"></center>
<br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/tradingcards/lg_71.gif" alt="Pointing down" title="Pointing down"></center>
<br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/alienaisha2.gif" alt="Some kinda diamond?" title="Some kinda diamond?"></center>

<br><br>

Some even have NO marking. Like Supreme Commander &amp; Sovereign Arlhox VII.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/betterthanyou/contestant927.gif" alt="Like to see him and Sloth get at it." title="Like to see him and Sloth get at it."></center>

<br><br>

To that you might say "Yeah, they also have four earstalks, not two." Maybe this Aishanaut isn't an Alien. But if the triangle differs this much, maybe you're not born with it. Maybe it's a cultural thing, and is tattooed on. And for one reason or another, this Aishanaut got an Alien Aisha tattoo. Maybe they proved themself somehow to an Alien Aisha, and got the tattoo that way. Maybe... maybe the Aishanaut IS Reina's mom, but Reina's DAD is an Alien Aisha. And he gave her the mark. And the reason Reina is a Christmas Aisha is because thats how her father's "four stalk" gene manifests in her?

<br><br>

But there's also what <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop</a> said about this being "an interesting plot when it comes to color." Now, Alien Aishas are their own species (as far as we know). They aren't (as far as we know) not just mutated Aishas. They are as distinct from regular Aishas as Blumaroos are from Baby Blus. But on the game and website Neopets.com, "Alien" is technically a "color" classification your Aisha can have. Maybe the plot will treat "Alien" as a "color," and there's some force out there that can turn Aishas into Aliens as easily as turning a faerie Grey. Or an Acara into whatever Vira is. 

<br><br>

But what we probably know the least about? The little Faellie this Aisha is traveling with. Just a friend of the Aisha? <b>The Power of Friendship</b> suggests they might be. But maybe the Faellie has some special talent or something that justifies bringing them on whatever mission this Aisha is in the middle of? And if we can move away from the sci-fi angle for a while and return to the high fantasy... we still have questions about the lyre. Its music shows us Orion's visions, but why does it do that? Where did the lyre come from? Who did it originally belong to? Is the lyre more than just a lyre?

<br><br>

A mysterious space Aisha who might be related to Reina, might have Alien Aisha friends, might have a Faellie friend with special talents, who might be in space, or in another dimension, or in someone's heart/mind, who might be dealing with the antimatter voidouts of space serpents or some primordial evil that turns faerie Grey and Acaras into Vira. So much could be. But what looks positively certain is that this DOES involve cosmic themes of some kind. An Aisha and their Faellie were traveling "somewhere in the universe," there was an accident (we don't know what caused it) and a new void-like place was happened upon.

<br><br>

This could be our springboard in the larger cosmic setting that revolves around Neopia. Whole new worlds. Godlike superbeings. Besides the faeries, that is. But if we've got faeries the likes we see in Neopia, maybe it's a mistake to try and assign one "genre" or "setting" to <b>The Void Within</b>. Think of it not like <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/bfm_warroom.phtml">Battle For Meridell</a> where you say "It's 'set' in Meridell. This is a medieval fantasy plot" or <a href="//www.neopets.com/space/ros/solution.phtml">Return of Dr. Sloth</a> where you say "It's 'set' on Virtupets Space Station. It's a sci-fi plot." This is a plot that could go anywhere and use anything. Not just because we're still speculating on what things will be like, but because even what we do know seems to say that will not be a plot with boundaries on theme. We will have faeries and magic, and we will have at least one space Aisha. We have had psychic Ogrins, we have had magic lyres, we have had obsidian magnates. There's not necessarily a theme here to define a "genre" or "aesthetic," these things have nothing alike other than they are things that exist in this universe. Anything in the universe could happen at this point.

<br><br>

If you remember nothing else, just keep in mind what we know for sure: Vira and a mysterious faerie are up to something, they have a voidy-looking Paint Brush, a space Aisha and their Faellie have crash landed in a voidy-looking place somewhere in the universe, we STILL don't know what the whole story behind this lyre is... and there's one more cutscene left in the year. New Year's Eve... Eve. December 30th. We are all awake now, and so we should all be seated for the finale. 

</li></ul><br><b>24th December, 2023 (Christmas Eve)</b>

<br><ul><li>It's Christmas Eve, and it's a busy one. Everyone's scrambling for last minute preparations, including <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=smudgeoffudge">SmudgeOfFudge</a>.

You'll recall that mysterious music and a mysterious lyre are constantly on Orion's mind nowadays. And that very soon he intends to prove to Reina that what he senses is real. And now we see this <b>Holiday Snow Lyre</b> has been added as a new item. It's "searchable," if you ask the <a href="//www.neopets.com/shops/wizard.phtml">Shop Wizard</a> for one he'll recognize the name, but the item itself hasn't been released yet. Could this item be released with Orion and Reina's next cutscene? Will we get to lay our hands upon the enigmatic lyre? And hopefully learn what its significance is? 

<br><br>

And will the animation that day be in any way related to Orion, or Reina, or Vira, or any of the other <b>Tales of Neovia</b> villains, or Reginald, or Baelia, or Tavi, or Jennumara, or Drakara, or Jhudora, or Illusen, or Fyora, or Malkus, or Balthazar, or Monty McTaggart, or Mira, or Kari, or Landelbrot, or Magon? We'll see in a couple days, for sure. But take this Christmas to rest up for the dark days ahead. Christmas is yours, but Boxing Day? Be here on Boxing Day.

<br><br><li>So, Orion seems to be going at least a little mad. Where'd he get the idea that Reina said she'd shut down the Advent Calendar? If not madness, exhaustion from all the sleep he's not getting. Either way, these visions, this music, it's having some kind of effect on him. <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=kh2riku_3">KH2Riku_3</a> had an interesting observation to make there: Orion is psychic, yes. But he's hearing things, that haunt him and drive him to extreme ends. Kinda like what happens to people under influence of The Three? One of the mentioned villains in <b>Tales of Neovia?</b> 

<br><br>

Are they in his mind? Is that what's brought him to this beleaguered state? And while they're in people's minds, could they be in Fyora's mind? How deep do these "suspicions" and "anxieties" now run? In any case, warning seems to be spreading. 

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/o5U9TeO.png" width="450" alt="What is she thinking" title="What is she thinking?"><br><br>

Know what wasn't included in the Tales though? Bythons. So back to that question of "Are the comics/animations themselves plot hints, are the animations hints like the cutscenes are?" If it had been an animation featuring Vira or something then it probably would've seemed like the animations matter for sure. But we didn't, we got the Christmas Bython. So does that mean the comics/animations are separate and the only thing to focus on for clues are the cutscenes?

<br><br>

Well, maybe not. Because Bythons ARE related to Orion. He helped discover them. So on that alone the animation might be meaningful. Suggesting that future animations on cutscene days will be relevant. But it might be even more relevant. Might have bearing on the plot itself. Speculation is poppin' off in <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162791342">this thread</a>, where <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=marilynmansonrocks">MarilynMansonRocks</a> reminds us that <b>The Void Within</b> will <b>take us to at least one place we haven't been before.</b> What if that place... isn't on this planet?

<br><br>

As revealed in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a>, Bythons were found in deep space, and are capable of interstellar travel. Maybe a Bython, or a few Bythons, will take us somewhere in space? Maybe where they come from? Maybe some colossal Bython broodmother somewhere? Maybe Bythons are integral to the plot? Don't forget the first teaser image.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/db6qPDU.png" width="450" alt="Perhaps not coming as early as initially hoped." title="Perhaps not coming as early as initially hoped."><br><br>

All this stuff about faeries and fantasy might help you forget that we got this very spacey looking image for <b>The Void Within</b>. And know what else? That glove looks to be emitting... radiation? Bloops? Those spherical bloops that the Void Paint Brush is emitting.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wnmlolW.png" width="450" alt="Voids, you might call them?" title="Voids, you might call them?"><br><br>

So this silhouetted person, are they friend or foe? Do they wield the same power as the Void Paint Brush? In any case, they certainly look spacey. Maybe they're the one who takes us to the Bython broodmother?

<br><br>

But in the immediate future... Orion has a burden of proof to justify. How can he possibly do it? Well, if what he sees is true, proof would be showing us that what he sees is true. Maybe that's what he'll do. Take Reina to see one of his nightmares/premonitions come true. But then... that's bad, we don't want them to come true. This would mean that darkness will be attacking soon! Let's hope it at least waits until after Christmas. Maybe Boxing Day. That sounds like a good day to fight evil.

</li></ul><br><b>12th December, 2023</b>

<br><ul><li>We were gathered 'round our TV sets today, for the Neopets AMA Holiday Special.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Tl0TVPs.png" width="450" alt="Redeem the code HOLIDAYMAGIC for a Musical Igloo Snowglobe!" title="Redeem the code HOLIDAYMAGIC for a Musical Igloo Snowglobe!"><br><br>

Of the musical guests, one was <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop</a> who had some more words about <b>The Void Within</b>. Fun fact: Dominic himself knows as much as we do of the upcoming plot. It's a secret that only the writer's room is privy too. So it was Dominic, actually, who asked for more details on it at the <b>50:37</b> mark. Aesop gives us these hints:

<br><br>

1. <b>It's gonna be an interesting plot when it comes to color.</b>
<br>
2. <b>The plot itself will take us to at least one place we haven't been before.</b>
<br>
3. <b>As a lot of Neopians have already picked up, there have been some hints to the upcoming plot in previous events.</b> (Like the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faeriefestival/index.phtml">Faerie Festival</a> epilogue) <b>Stay tuned for anything coming from events, might be some more dialogue from Orion.</b>

<br><br>

Yeah, we might hear from Orion in a day or two, in fact.

<br><br>

But those first two hints. Food for thought indeed. "An interesting plot when it comes to color?" The speculation that this is a Grey Faerie/Baelia plot has been strong. This kinda solidifies it. But maybe "comes to color" means more than just "It's about Greyness." There's still that Paint Brush from the comic.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wnmlolW.png" width="450" alt="All living things know darkness, but this was not darkness." title="All living things know darkness, but this was not darkness."><br><br>

With the plot (so far) titled <b>The Void Within</b>, let's call this Paint Brush the "Void Paint Brush" for now. The Void Paint Brush being a key weapon these villains possess, color changes are probably in the bargain of whatever they intend to do to Neopia. Color changing itself used as a weapon/instrument of conquest. Maybe this goes even deeper, deals with the essence itself of Paint Brush colors in Neopia. The colors we all already are. Maybe it establishes some lore about how that works. Maybe color is the life and light of Neopia and dead, Grey world is this faerie's ambition?

<br><br>

But then, if this is a Grey Faerie/Baelia plot, and a plot that acknowledges and focuses on Paint Brushes, it should be noted that we already have a Grey Paint Brush.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/greypntbrush.gif" alt="A lot more... actually Grey compared to the other Paint Brush." title="A lot more... actually Grey compared to the other Paint Brush."></center>

<br><br>

So if this plot is acknowledging Paint Brushes in the world of Neopia, Vira's Paint Brush probably doesn't actually turn you Grey specifically. We already have a Paint Brush for that. So if this is a Grey Faerie plot and a plot that acknowledges Paint Brushes... what does the Void Paint Brush do? And what could it possibly have to do with Baelia or Grey Faeries or Greyness? 

<br><br>

Maybe it would help to remember the words from Shadow Usul's story: <b>All living things know darkness, but this was not darkness. This was pure nothing.</b>

<br><br>

And then there's "The plot itself will take us to at least one place we haven't been before." At LEAST one. So there could be multiple new stops on our route. But what does "haven't been" mean? Does this mean lands that have been established, but aren't accessible on the map? Because one land that probably comes to most minds is <a href="//www.neopets.com/tropical/index.phtml">Lutari Island</a>. Still can't do anything here. Yes, they did say we were not having a Lutari Island plot right this second. But does that mean Lutari Island can't "feature" in a plot? What does Neostaff mean by "Lutari Island plot?" Is it a Lutari Island plot if Lutari Island comes up at all? How much "focus" should there be on the land in question? 

<br><br>

There's other islands too, islands that you can't even click on. Like Dacardia. Or the <a href="//www.neopets.com/mip/index.phtml">Lost Isle</a>. But hold on, maybe "haven't been" means "hasn't featured in a plot yet." And though we were kinda left hanging, that would rule out the Lost Isle. For now. But Lutari Island hasn't been in a plot, has nothing to do on the map, and what's more... it has a very enigmatic Paint Brush. Still doesn't do anything.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/paintbrush_lutari_island.gif" alt="Might be a challenge establishing a unique aesthetic identity for Lutari Island." title="Might be a challenge establishing a unique aesthetic identity for Lutari Island."></center>

<br><br>

Way back in 2022, at the start of this coverage, we speculated that the next plot might be a Lutari Island one. That was seemingly shot down. But if Lutari Island will feature in some capacity? Chalk that up as a prediction come true.

</li>

<br><br><li>Intermediate evil. If current speculation is correct about Vira's faerie mistress being behind the force that turned Baelia Grey, "intermediate" is probably not the word. Over the last few days Orion has found himself haunted by terrifying visions of Neopia's doom. He is beaten and broken by... something? That alone sounds more than "intermediate."

<br><br>

Speculation is underway all over <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=7">Board 7</a>. For those of us not working with Vira, our latest lead that "something" is going is that lyre Orion found in the snow. He's kept it with him. 

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1XcgoJs.png" alt="This mission has cost him a pocket watch, it seems." title="This mission has cost him a pocket watch, it seems."></center>

<br><br>

Perhaps it is in the lyre or its music that we find more answers. Maybe Orion, being some kinda psychic, will use psychometry to reveal the lyre's secrets?

<br><br>

Some things to consider, knowing that the lyre is some kind of relevant: What was the lyre doing on Terror Mountain, and when was it put there? Does the lyre belong to the dark faerie, or one of her associates? Is the lyre a weapon of evil? Let's consider the theory that the M.O. of this faerie (and the ones she works with) is seducing those seeking things. People making desperate wishes for stuff. "More beauty," in Vira's case. Maybe the lyre's music is what you hear when the shadows are listening and approaching you with an offer? Evil, being a liar, tends to be attractive. It would come with beautiful music. Maybe the music Orion heard was the work of evil forces seeking to prey on his vulnerabilities?

<br><br>

Or maybe the lyre isn't evil? Maybe the lyre belonged to one of the victims of this darkness and that's why, upon finding it, Orion is having these visions. He's seeing the forces that happened upon whoever owned this lyre first. But who would keep a lyre? Maybe a faerie? Maybe a GREY faerie? Or a faerie that once was NOT Grey? A lyre is the kind of instrument a faerie would probably play, right? What's more, Baelia (a faerie who was turned Grey) was kept on on a mountain, per her <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=179">Neopedia</a> entry.

<br><br><b><i>The shadows disappeared, leaving her alone with the cold sunrise, but at sunset, they would be back, to taunt her further. She would cry, but her eyes had no more tears. There were no birds on this mountaintop, no friendly animals to hear her call for help.</i></b>

<br><br>

Maybe Terror Mountain is that mountain? Some isolated peak on its range where evil can prosper?

<br><br>

If you're psychic like Orion, you may have to wade through a few more nightmares before the answers are found. Those of us who aren't will have to mull over (potential?) clues. Like the Shadow Usul making an appearance in Reginald's study. How much does this mean? Is the Advent Calendar animation related to the dialogue as well? Because if this is meaningful, let's wind the clocks back to Halloween real quick when we were speculating on which of the Tales of Neovia books, if any or all, were related to <b>The Void Within</b>. Vira's story, the "strange grey book," was the only one that stood out. It alone got a special mention in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2023-10-30">New Features</a>. It alone was grey, and the leading speculation about <b>The Void Within</b> is that it's probably about a Grey Faerie. So it was starting to look like Vira was the only relevant villain of the 7 mentioned in the Tales of Neovia collection. But now the Shadow Usul appeared during this plot teaser. So maybe Vira isn't the only Void-relevant character in the collection. Maybe, just maybe, they're ALL relevant like some people initially thought? They're ALL tied to the temptations of this faerie or "faeries," plural? If the dialogue and the Advent Calendar animation are both things we're meant to pay attention to? 

<br><br>

How many villains out there might owe a debt to Vira's friend? How many names in their book of allies? Vira? Vile? Balthazar? Maybe even McTaggart? How deep does corruption seep? How near are those who would hear the need of the weak, and lure them in with promises of dreams come true???

<br><br>

Alas, poor Orion. You find yourself haunted by nightmares of a bad future. And with this terrible power comes the terrible burden of saving us from what you see. Wouldn't it be something if Orion was the Unfortunate Holiday Ogrin? The one who used to show up every year on Ogrin Day? He's been known to change colors.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/toy_advc2013_unfoholiogriaf.gif" alt="Unfortunate Holiday Ogrin Action Figure" title="Unfortunate Holiday Ogrin Action Figure"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/boo_advc2013_unlucholid.gif" alt="Unlucky Holidays" title="Unlucky Holidays"></center>

<br><br>

As a crafty woman once said, "there is much to do." If that applies to the wicked, it certainly applies to those who fight it. And with Orion hot on the trail of this wickedness, maybe someone should keep an eye on him. He's made himself a target. Those who work in shadow tend to prefer staying hidden. It would be the final misfortune if Orion was to, say, die or something. But perhaps there's something to appreciate about Winter Starlight and holiday merriment when it comes to defeating darkness. After all, what is holiday cheer but proof against the dark and cold?

<br><br>

Be merry, be of good cheer, and stay tuned. We'll definitely be hearing from Orion soon. And as for whoever left that lyre there, they might still be out and about. Let's hope they enjoy good cheer too.

<br><ul><li><b><font color="#DB7512">Halloween Night</font></b> has fallen proper. Last day for those Trick-or-Treat bags. Speaking of which, there's an interesting post in today's <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2023-10-30">New Features</a>.

<p><b>Happy Halloween! Today (10/31) is the last day to go Trick-or-Treating and read Reginald's new scary stories from <a href="//www.neopets.com/explore.phtml">Tales of Neovia</a>!</b>
          </p><p><b>However, Reginald has been warning Trick-or-Treaters to beware of a strange grey book that has been reportedly found inside of some Trick-or-Treat bags.

Be wary of any suspicious tales you may come across, as you never know where they might lead...</b>

<br><br></p><center><a href="//www.neopets.com/explore.phtml"><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/465_reginald.gif"></a></center>

<br><br>Strange grey book." The only one of those books that was grey was in the Vira Trick-or-Treat Bags. Don't wanna rule anything out, but Vira's story is the only one of those stories that Reginald is bringing to our attention here. Of all those stories, that one is special. That one warrants extra attention. So it's gotta be important, right? Maybe more important than the others? 

<br><br>

The other stories might be plot relevant, might not be plot relevant. But the evidence continues to pile up that Vira's story definitely is, and that this is totally gonna be a Grey Faerie plot. A plot about faeries, greyness, Vira, and that which binds them.</li></ul><br><b>24th October, 2023</b>

<br><ul><li>It has been a busy day today. The kind that creates so much lag that it takes the site down for maintenance. Two new things on the agenda today. First, there's a new... "daily" I guess you could call it? A daily set of achievements to fulfill, found in your brand new handy-dandy <a href="//www.neopets.com/questlog/">Quest Log</a>.

<br><br>

The book appears almost handmade with a title that says "Greatest Ruler in Neopian History." Most of the text inside seems to be ramblings that barely make sense. But the end has a fairly clear message...

<br><br><i>
From the first moment he appeared, it was clear who was meant to be the ruler of Neopia. None before him have had his charisma, intellect, or overpowering strength. The fools of Neopia just couldn't grasp his vision. But I did. I have always seen the future that our overlord has envisioned for us.

<br><br>

They say he is cruel, but he just has the fortitude to do what must be done. No one else could make the hard calls or is willing to sacrifice like he is—all to give us a better, more united world.

<br><br>

The glorious moments that he graced us with his presence in the past were marvels I am blessed to have witnessed. If it were not for the heinous deeds of the few, we would most certainly have seen his true plans come to fruition. First, that despicable faerie got in the way, and then a group of greedy ne'er-do-wells crushed our master's merciful plans. Last time, a pitiful excuse of an organisation that abhorrently had the galls to call themselves a resistance punishes us all by ensnaring our liberator, thus eliminating all hope for us. But I still believe.

<br><br>

They say I am mad, but I see the connecting twine. I have faced the void of the unknowable and survived to learn the truth. Even though I only saw the smallest of glimpses into the colossal, intertwined, inner workings of our beloved leader's mind I know without question that he has a plan that will undeniably save us all.

<br><br>

I have bided my time and gathered like-minded, devoted followers. Even as I write this, we are working to do whatever it takes to continue his work. If you are reading this, I can only assume it is in the halls of a great museum, made to glorify our prosperous emperor and that I have succeeded in my attempt to find and free our saviour.

<br><br>

I leave these final words as a continuous promise.
<br>
I will do whatever it takes to protect Lord Sloth!

This book has no title. Its jet-black cover and warped binding are inscribed with strange symbols that hurt your eyes if you stare at it too long. The pages are illegible except for one hastily scribbled note.

<br><br><i>
Until the end of my days, I will never forget the night it came.

<br><br>

We had heard whispers of something evil on the edge of the Haunted Woods, but our elders had told us to remain calm and that this threat would pass; surely, there was safety in numbers.

<br><br>

Then the disappearances started.

<br><br>

Curfew was imposed, and nobody was allowed to wander at night alone.

<br><br>

It didn't stop.

<br><br>

A council was hastily convened, and it was determined that there was no other choice but to make a stand. We would gather at the next new moon when Kreludor's face was hidden. Preparations were made, and the whole village readied itself.

<br><br>

If only we could have understood what we truly faced.

<br><br>

We knew it had arrived when we could see the breath condense before our faces on what had -- just moments ago -- been a warm summer evening. A deathly cold snap seized the air, the breeze itself seemingly fracturing under the onset of an otherworldly chill.

<br><br>

We had set torches to light the wooden palisades surrounding the village square, hoping that the warmth of the burning braziers would deter it: a light against the darkness.

<br><br>

We were wrong.

<br><br>

Huddled together for warmth and safety, we gaped in abject horror as the torches were snuffed out, one by one. Silence gripped the air, and not one of us dared to move.

<br><br>

Slowly, inevitably, a shadow began to coalesce, its suffocating gloom covering us in an impenetrable barrier that was devoid of all light.

<br><br>

All living things know darkness, but this was not darkness. This was pure nothing.

<br><br>

I stood paralysed in terror as the final glimmer of illumination was siphoned away from my sight, leaving me utterly blind. Even sound seemed stifled in this place; my frantic pleas for help barely left my mouth as more than a gasped whisper.

<br><br>

All was still, like the calm before the storm.

<br><br>

And then - there in the darkness - two eyes appeared, their pupils like cosmic maelstroms.

<br><br>

Our gazes met, and I stared into the void.

<br><br>

I remember nothing after that moment.

<br><br>

When I came to, it was the morning, and I was alone. My friends, my family, the entire village: they were all gone, like they had never existed in the first place. I searched and searched, and when I could search no longer, I left that forsaken place and never returned.

<br><br>

This memory is why I live in fear. Those eyes are the source of my nightmares.

<br><br>

I will write its name here because I dare not speak it aloud:

<br><br>Shadow Usul."

This book is both there and not there at the same time. It's hard to comprehend, so it's best not to think too hard about it. There are not really words inside this book, but voices that speak to you through text... again, it is best not to dwell on it.

<br><br><i>
A fully corporeal piece of paper is stuck inside the book. It reads - "WARNING: If you start to feel as though these words are affecting your reality in any way, you should close it immediately and read no further!"

<br><br>


The first voice reads as a sickly sweet sound. She says, "I am above all, already my dears. Why should we make note of this in some record?"

<br><br>

Another voice is dark and feels aggravated. His voice raises as he says, "You dare question me? You should know very well that my methods are beyond doubt!"

<br><br>

The last voice is gruff and drips of voracity. He is hard to understand as he spits out, "Doubt, doubt? Don't make me laugh. Your methods have never given me anything, so of course, I can doubt."

<br><br>

The angry voice has a distinct shape in the text now, a cloaked, tall figure with a stern face and the words shout he is to be called Revenge.

<br><br>

He speaks again. "There is more than just a record to be kept here. There is an opportunity."

<br><br>

The text now formally introduces you to the one known as Ambition. Her wings and dark hair are formed through the words in a beautiful yet deadly manner.

<br><br>

Her voice pierces the pages as she says, "Oh? I see. I am sure I have guessed your plan already, but go on tell us."

<br><br>Tell me, tell me. I want to know now, how dare you play these games!" Greed's harsh voice spits out of the text as his form intrudes as well, a rough exterior that matches his tone and a face that is hard to read.

<br><br>Shut up, you fools. I will not bark because you demand it!" Revenge growls. "Besides, there is no need to explain it, as it is already taking place! Even now, eyes peruse this page.

<br><br>The lure of my power is great, wouldn't you agree?" sings Ambition.

<br><br>My power is greater still!" yells Greed.

<br><br>I wasn't talking to you, you ignoramus!" Ambition says.

<br><br>We could even stop this now if we so wish. I can feel their curiosity is peaked…the void to their mind is open." Revenge says.

<br><br>Make sure to listen to those voices in your head."

The waterlogged book has had many of its words washed away, yet some entries are still somehow in pristine condition.


<br><br><i>
Entry 193
<br>
The ship is still as strong as ever. I may have lost some crew, but if they were lily-livered enough to be captured so easily, then they may as well be fish food. My name still strikes fear in all those who hear it, so I will be able to replenish my cannon fodder soon enough.

<br><br>

Entry 245
<br>
The new crew members be something else. I have dealt with some of the toughest this here sea has to offer, and yet, I think this crop must have wills of iron. Some barely have their sea legs but still yet dare look me in the eye. I would oft cut one in two for such a thing, but I have a feeling power like this could come in handy.

<br><br>

Entry 282
<br>
We have taken many a boat and sunk twice that. The wealth we have acquired could only be matched by those of kings, and the power my crew now holds none could dream to match. But this is nothing new for me. However, I hear whispers of a location that not only possesses a new sort of power but is said to have acquired a treasure unlike any other. It will be mine.

<br><br>

Entry 361
<br>
Learning more about this supposed location of wealth and power has been slow, but getting the information out of those who have it is an easy feat for my crew. So I have decided, once we know more about how to track down what I seek, I shall have my men continue on as if I am on board while I find this power all for myself! The world will continue to tremble at the mere mention of my name while I hoard this new wealth and power all to myself!

<br><br>

Entry 439
<br>
I have found the location. A particular new acquaintance of mine has agreed to help me in this search. She and I will set out soon. Only a few know of my departure, and fewer still know of my intended destination. But if all goes according to plan, I will become strong enough to not only wipe New Maraqua off the face of the planet but all of Neopia if I so wish!

I've been told to write about a friend. It can be anything I want: a true story about us or one where we interact in a fictional setting…but I don't know if I can do either. I don't have many friends here. Most of the other students seem to avoid me because I don't do so well in school. There is one girl who is nice to me from time to time, though, which is strange because she's the top student! Her name is Xandra.

<br><br>

I don't know if I'd call her a friend yet, but I can still tell a story about us.

<br><br>

Back when the disappearances were still happening. I was sitting alone at lunch like usual. We have lunch outside when the weather permits it, and that day, it was cloudy but overall nice. Looking back on it now, it seems reckless to have continued to have lunch outside, but the disappearances were few and far between and only seemed to happen at night. So life went on like normal.

<br><br>

I was eating underneath a tree near the forest line when Xandra came and sat next to me. She didn't say much, then got up and walked into the forest, waving for me to follow. I shouldn't have followed, but I did. The forest was especially dark due to the cloudy weather, and it was hard to keep up with her, but eventually, we stopped.

<br><br>

We had come upon a small open patch in the middle of the forest. Even with the lack of trees, the open area was still fairly dark. I watched as Xandra placed odd trinkets along its edge. I also stood off to the side and asked her what we were doing here, but she never responded. Eventually, she stood in the middle of the clearing, and her eyes began to glow.

<br><br>

The trinkets lit up in the same bright light as Xandra's eyes. They were shining so much that the clearing had to have been visible for miles. I wanted to run, but I was unable to. All I could manage was moving my arms to cover my eyes, and that's when I noticed I was shining too, brighter than any of the trinkets around. Though we both were training in magic, none of this was under my control. It was my power but all her doing.

<br><br>

Soon, I heard rustling all around us. The once quiet forest now echoed with noises that sounded far too large to be anything good. For a moment, I wondered if this was her magic as well, but then I saw it. A massive creature dripping an odd ooze with multiple eyes and rows upon rows of razor sharp teeth. It rose behind Xandra, its terrifying jaw wide open as it stared right at me.

<br><br>

Xandra's arms rose and pointed at me at the same time the creature lunged forward. All I could do was scream and close my eyes, cursing myself for falling into her trap. Yet, when I opened my eyes, I was on the ground, unharmed. The glowing had stopped, and the terrifying creature lay off to the side, covered in the odd trinkets that were previously on the ground. They seemed to now form a sort of cage around the thing. Rendering it immobile.

<br><br>

Xandra helped me up but I am uncertain what happened next because I fled as fast as I could. But after that, the disappearances stopped completely, and Xandra moved up in the school. I have the odd sensation that I had been used as bait, but I am not necessarily upset about it. Maybe I will ask her about it over tea sometime…I think Xandra will really be something special one day.

The words in this book are ancient and faded, but you can decipher one section clearly:

<br><br><i>...And so the Darkest Faerie, one of the twelve founders of Altador, city of heroes, fell from grace. Her betrayal was swift and ruthless, her ultimate desire being none other than complete dominion over Neopia. With no other choice, Fyora, the Faerie Queen, and Jerdana, sorceress and one of the twelve, wove a powerful spell that turned the Darkest Faerie into stone.

<br><br>

For nearly 1000 years, the Darkest Faerie remained entombed, the memory of her evil slowly fading, until one fateful day when the magical bonds of her imprisonment finally broke. Darkness returned to Neopia as the Darkest Faerie subjugated Fyora and the remainder of those who might stop her, and all seemed lost.

<br><br>

Yet in that direst of hours, unlikely heroes rose to answer the call. Aided by the disguised King Altador, two brave Neopians - Tormund and Roberta - thwarted the Darkest Faerie's nefarious plan, freed Queen Fyora, and returned the Darkest Faerie to stone form.

<br><br>

However, evil never sleeps, and with the fall of Faerieland and the sequence of events that followed, the Darkest Faerie escaped. Although her subsequent plots were foiled again, this time, she evaded confinement. Choosing instead to flee into the void to lick her wounds, planning her next nefarious move.

<br><br>

Some believe she resides in some dark corner of the world, biding her time as she waits for the opportune moment to reveal her sinister ambitions once more. Some few even claim there is proof out there that her next plan is already imminent..."

Almost all of this book has turned grey. Bits and pieces of it seem to have the book's original colour, but even as you hold it the grey is ever so slowly creeping away at it, making it difficult to read most of the words printed on it.

<br><br><i>
You want a scary story? I'll give you one.

<br><br>

There once was a beautiful Acara. She was graceful, charming, and, of course, humble. When others looked upon her, they would shower her with admiration.

<br><br>You're more beautiful than any flower I've ever seen."

<br><br>You shine brighter than any star in the sky."

<br><br>I would do anything for you."

<br><br>

This Acara had it all—beauty, admiration, so she had happiness as well.

<br><br>

She wanted for nought. Yet one day, a wish of hers was…misunderstood, and it all came crumbling down.

<br><br>

A vile curse was laid upon her, and she became ugly, so ugly that her humble heart turned bitter.

<br><br>

There was no way for her to get her beauty back or her happiness back, so she turned to violence.

<br><br>

But the darkness that had turned her soon returned and made her a promise. She would be beautiful again, more beautiful than ever before if she listened.

<br><br>

And so she did, and do you know what she learned? That the darkness can be too powerful, so there is no point in fighting it.

<br><br>

She and the darkness made a deal that day, a deal that will soon come to fruition. So hear my words now.

<br><br>

If you wish to survive the coming terror, then do not impede on the darkness creeping in. I am sure you will start to feel it. Some may already know its tight grip.

<br><br>

There is so much more at play than what you think is about to happen. Let the dark take you in, or else you may regret it.

<br><br>

You wanted a scary story, and oh, are you about to get one...

<br><br><li>So if these bags are related somehow to <b>The Void Within</b>, how might they be? <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=lunahlove">LunahLove</a> made an interesting <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162664828">observation</a>: Most of the stories make mention of a void. Sloth's, Shadow Usul's, The Three's, and the Darkest Faerie's story all use the word "void" somehow.

<br><br>

Excerpt from the Sloth story: <b>I have faced the void of the unknowable and survived to learn the truth.</b>
<br><br>
Excerpt from the Shadow Usul story: <b>Our gazes met, and I stared into the void.</b>
<br><br>
Excerpt from The Three story: <b>We could even stop this now if we so wish. I can feel their curiosity is peaked…the void to their mind is open." Revenge says.</b>
<br><br>
Excerpt from the Darkest Faerie story: <b>Choosing instead to flee into the void to lick her wounds, planning her next nefarious move.</b>

<br><br>

Hunting for word patterns like that is very reminiscent of the old mystery plots on Neopets. But then so are red herrings. So if that doesn't grab you, consider TDF's story. It alludes to the idea that her next attack is now imminent. That she's gotten better since <a href="//www.neopets.com/twr/">The Wraith Resurgence</a> and she's making moves right now. Would this mean that TDF is the faerie from the comic? Even if she isn't, we could very well be dealing with multiple faeries working in a coven. If this is a Baelia plot, Jennumara has to be related somehow. So if the faerie in the comic ISN'T Jennumara, that means multiple faeries are already connected to this.

<br><br>

But perhaps most important of all is the Vira story. Because we know for a fact that Vira is involved in whatever is happening with the aforementioned comic. We saw her in it. The book that holds her story was turning grey. The popup that awards you the bag is even grey. None of the other popups are grey. And regardless of the order you pick them up, Vira's popup is always grey. Why would her popup be grey? It really suggests that this upcoming plot will be about Baelia, and the greyness of Grey Faeries. And possibly the greyness of other things. A creeping darkness that takes things in and makes them grey. 

<br><br>

Vira and at least one dark faerie are confirmed to be involved though. But if these other tales are also relevant, let's break down the main takeaways...

<br><br>

Sloth's tale is about a guy who "faced the void of the unknowable" and saw some plan Sloth supposedly has since he was defeated in his brief <a href="http://neopets.com/space/ros/comic.phtml">Return</a>.

<br><br>

Shadow Usul's tale is about how the Shadow Usul is herself "the void."

<br><br>

The Three's tale is about them reaching into the void of our own minds. Not unlike the guy from the Sloth tale, our minds were touched by a mysterious power. The Three's mysterious power. Almost made as crazy as the guy from the Sloth story.

<br><br>

Scarblade's tale is about him sneaking off with "a particular new acquaintance" to a place of wealth and power that will afford him the means to let him destroy New Maraqua, as well as any place else in Neopia. If these journal entries are set after <a href="//www.neopets.com/water/plot_com.phtml">Curse of Maraqua</a>, this means Scarblade is currently acting on new plans to terrorize Neopia's seas and shores. 

<br><br>

Xandra's tale is about her luring a classmate into the woods to, it seems, be used as bait to catch "A massive creature dripping an odd ooze with multiple eyes and rows upon rows of razor sharp teeth."

<br><br>

TDF's tale is basically a recap of her last two adventures, and a warning that she's currently making moves probably.

<br><br>

Vira's tale is about her being tempted by darkness and serving it as a footsoldier. Or maybe less "tempted" than "tricked." <b><i>She wanted for nought. Yet one day, a wish of hers was…misunderstood, and it all came crumbling down.</i></b> That's how she became what she is. She wasn't careful what she wished for. Like Darigan and Kass weren't careful what they wished for when they did business with The Three. Like Scarblade is potentially not being careful by seeking this wealth and power with his new friend. Like this Sloth superfan is surely not being careful by, first of all allying with Sloth, but second of all hitching their star to this supposed plan they think Sloth has.

<br><br>

With these tales we have ambitious people potentially being led astray, and creatures of darkness that seem to see into our minds and souls. A coming terror that might have had its grip on the vast majority of villainy in Neopia, that Vira would seemingly have us not fight. Malkus and Balthazar, two people who up until now had not seen partnership, are involved in this. That much is confirmed. Maybe this darkness seeks to tempt as many of Neopia's weak of heart as it can reach. Perhaps the breadth of Neopian villainy. If this darkness is so intertwined with villains from Sloth to Scarblade, the coming battle might be for all the marbles. 

<br><br>

Nowadays it feels like Neopia is either on the verge of the great comeback, or the end of days. But which way the coin falls is up to us. Perhaps now more than ever.


</li></ul><br><b>20th October, 2023</b>

<br><ul><li>More convention news. Neopets is at gamescom asia, spelled with all lower case letters apparently. <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=jooon93">Jooon93</a> was able to attend, and has an update on when <b>The Void Within</b> is scheduled to go live. If you thought "Early 2024" meant some time in January or February, that is currently not the plan. But rather, <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162657114">Q2 2024</a>.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5eJvx2a.png" width="450" alt="Hi community! I attended gamescon asia, TNT gave a brochure that announced that the plot is only coming out in Q2 of 2024!!

Not in the first 3 months as what we previously thought!"><br><br>

Q2 meaning "Quarter 2." The second quarter of the 12 months that makes up the year 2024. Not January, February, or March. But some time in April, May, and/or June. 

<br><br>

You might be thinking "But that's prime real estate for the Festival of Neggs and the Altador Cup. What's gonna happen to those events?" Anything could. They might cancel them. If a dangerous faerie has returned to sow death and darkness, maybe Neopia shouldn't have a Cup. Maybe spring CAN'T come. On the other hand, these events are big draws. Especially the Cup. So, how much time does a plot need? <a href="//www.neopets.com/mip/index.phtml">Journey to the Lost Isle</a> and the <a href="//www.neopets.com/prehistoric/outskirts/">Obelisk War</a> lasted only about a month. The <a href="//www.neopets.com/desert/ldp/">2005 Lost Desert Plot</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tfr/">The Faeries' Ruin</a> lasted about 3 months. Most comic-having plots do. 3 solid months with no postponements from the typical content schedule would mean this plot would start when the Festival of Neggs is just getting underway, and end when the Cup is entering its final battle. 

<br><br>

It could go on for just around 2 months though. <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/wanderer_camp.phtml">Tale of Woe</a> went for a little less than 2 months, people seem to really like that one. Though it was light on dialogue, which may have contributed to how fast it went. <a href="http://neopets.com/space/ros/comic.phtml">Return of Dr. Sloth</a>, lasted about a month and a half. People still speak highly of the <a href="//www.neopets.com/space/ros/solution.phtml">Breaking The Code puzzle</a>. Though a lot of it apparently had to be scrapped/streamlined from the original vision. 2 months of plot could maybe fit if we postpone the Negg Fest or the Cup by a week or two?

<br><br>

In the interest of being as prepared as possible, what's probably not gonna happen is the plot launching earlier than scheduled. Plots typically don't launch earlier than scheduled. It also bears remembering that this plot was originally planned for 2023, but was pushed to 2024. So if anything's possible, further postponements are possible. Just don't let your guard down. We once waited 4 years for a plot (that plot being Return of Dr. Sloth). This faerie, whoever she is, is coming.

Hold onto your bladders, ladies and gentlemen. When they said this thing was on until the 19th, they apparently meant it. We got our post-credits scene. If you revisit the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faeriefestival/index.phtml">Faerie Festival</a>...

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/faeriefestival/2023/np/8OCYjoe5epn7s74pQ.png" width="450" alt="Chapter Zero of The Void Within?" title="Chapter Zero of The Void Within?"><br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=7">Board 7</a> scrambles to the ready. There have been many intriguing signs over the years, but it's been a long time indeed since last we've seen an actual comic. Nigh universal sign of a plot, and a most reliable crowd pleaser. Let's break this thing down...

<br><br>

Jhudora and Illusen slap box for a bit while Fyora looks preoccupied with something. And someone happens to be preoccupied with Fyora. We see Vira, who (like a good comic) has not been seen in a while.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/166_vira.gif" width="120" alt="Vira in flight" title="Vira in flight"><img src="//images.neopets.com/evil/vira150.gif" width="120" alt="In Vira's sight" title="In Vira's sight"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/tradingcards/premium/0912.gif" width="120" alt="Who's Vira's friend?" title="Who's Vira's friend?"></center>

<br><br>

Vira, like Malkus, is one of those villainous also-rans. First introduced as a Battledome Challenger on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2002-10-28">October 30th, 2002</a>, then later got a <a href="//www.neopets.com/evil/showcreature.phtml?villain=13">Gallery of Evil</a> entry on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2003-04-07">April 8th, 2003</a>. 

<br><br><b><i>Vira was a pretty and vain Acara, spending her days playing in the flowers, making daisy chains to braid into her long hair. One day, she wished to be the most beautiful Acara in the whole of the world, but the wrong ears heard her wish. "You are pretty," the shadowy voice said. "Only I can make you beautiful...<i></i></i></b>

<br><br><b><i>Ever since, Vira has wandered those same fields, kissing the flowers, but making them poisonous to the touch. The magic mirrors she gives away do not show reality, but a twisted, ugly version of it. Anyone who looks into her mirrors at first finds themselves very beautiful, but that beauty fades into ugliness, and the mirror whispers with a dark voice, "There's only one way to get your beauty back...<i></i></i></b>

<br><br>

She's not a faerie, but talk about your characters long overdue for a resolution! 

<br><br>

Speaking of faeries, Vira appears to be congregating with one. They appear to be talking about that whole business with Malkus and Monty poisoning the planet and Balthazar trying to bottle Illusen. Good times, feels like only yesterday. Apparently Malkus didn't succeed in weakening them? Climate change has not proven to be the death sentence for Neopia the young people feared it would be? Well just wait a second, says this mysterious faerie. Malkus's machinations were merely a herald of this faerie's true wrath. 

<br><br>

And Fyora seems to know it. She's thinking about something. She's probably noticed the telltale signs. That's what she's so preoccupied with. She's noticing the patterns in what plagues Neopia and thinking "Hmmmm, could it be her?" Vira says this is a dangerous game to play. Fyora will rally defenses and whatever this faerie is planning will be dashed against the mght of Neopia's heroes. 

<br><br>

And then? Then we see the silhouette of the faerie in question. She appears cloaked. She appears... gaunt. Unmistakable Dark Faerie wings behind her. And are those jewels about her neck and crown?

<br><br>

Whoever this faerie is, she seems confident in her use of the agents of fear and uncertainty. She seems to know Fyora, know that Fyora is so terrified of what she thinks this might mean, that she will keep this thing top secret until she's absolutely sure. It's apparently a strong claim to allege that this faerie is back in play. Whoever she is.

<br><br>

And at last, as Vira and this faerie depart to their work, we see what looks like a paint brush under glass. <b>There is much to do...</b>

<br><br>

Wowwee. So, that's our questions from yesterday addressed? Who is at the top? Vira and this faerie. What of the poisoning of Neopia's Earth and Water Faeries? Vira and this faerie are on it. But now we have new questions. Like, who is the faerie? Well, we know who she's probably not. She's probably not Jhudora because, well, she's looking at Jhudora. And she's probably not TDF because... TDF has long hair. But if our speculation about <b>The Void Within</b> being about Baelia is correct, surely it's Jennumara, right? Here's that <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=179">Neopedia article</a> again...

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/neopedia/179_grey_faerie.gif" alt="Are any of you Jennumara?" title="Are any of you Jennumara?"></center>

<br><br>

Just a side note, it's probably nothing, but Baelia's Neopedia article and Vira's Gallery of Evil article were both released in April 2003. Within 10 days of each other. Probably nothing...

<br><br>

But there's another, potentially much more likely candidate for this faerie's identity, A faerie up to now only featured in the Premium Neodeck: Drakara.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/tradingcards/premium/lg_0812.gif" alt="Matches the profile, doesn't she?" title="Matches the profile, doesn't she?"></center>

<br><br>

She's got the wings, the sunken cheekbones, the jewels on the neck and forehead. She doesn't have a cloak, but you look at it and you could probably imagine some horns fitting under it, right? "But wait, if the plot stars Baelia, surely Jennumara is the better fit" you might think. But you might notice that Drakara and Baelia both have feathers on their wings. Or what was left of them, in Baelia's case. For that, many suspect that Drakara and Baelia have history of some kind. 

<br><br>

So who is Drakara? Is there anything actually establishing a history between her and Baelia, aside from these feathers? Right now nothing concrete has been established. Up until now (if this is even her) she's only appeared in the Premium Neodeck Collection. For December 2008. Kinda makes you wonder how long they've been wanting to do something with her.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3KXzjrF.png" width="450" alt="Beat the Maleficent fad by a good 5 years." title="Beat the Maleficent fad by a good 5 years."><br><br>

If matching Baelia's feathers is of note, we should also consider how she kinda matches Vira's horns? Did Drakara make Vira into what she is now? Was she the voice Vira heard? Because in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=479">Editorial</a> of Neopian Times Issue #479 it's established that the one who cursed Vira was likely a dark faerie.

<br><br><b><i><a href="//www.neopets.com/evil/showcreature.phtml?villain=13">Vira</a> isn't a mutant Acara - nor are we sure what colour she once was. She was cursed (likely by a dark faerie, hence the wings), giving her a unique look that no other Acara has (or would want!).</i></b>

<br><br>

And regarding whoever cursed Vira, in the Neopian Times Issue #584 <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=584">Editorial</a> <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=shadokaty">ShadOKaty</a> asked if it might be Vanity, one of the Dark Faerie Sisters who works in partnership with The Darkest Faerie.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/tcg/cotd_dfaerie/0029_HS01.gif" width="200" alt="Vanity, who seems to be cursing someone with ugliness." title="Vanity, who seems to be cursing someone with ugliness."><img src="//images.neopets.com/tcg/cotd_travels/0055_RV49.gif" width="200" alt="Vanity is the one in the backless dress." title="Vanity is the one in the backless dress."></center>

<br><br>

Vanity appears to work with mirrors and the cursing of one's physical appearance, which are themes related to Vira. So a good guess. But Neostaff said no. Elaborating...

<br><br><b><i>There are even darker things in Neopia than those pesky dark faerie sisters...</i></b>

<br><br>

So if Vira's maker is on the scene, we are likely dealing with darkness unprecedented. Darker than Malice, Spite, and Vanity at the very least. And that's saying something considering they shoot for The Darkest Faerie herself. 

<br><br>

But enough said about the players in this plot, what of their tools? That's probably the greatest forecaster of what their plans are for Neopia. A paint brush was seen in the final scene. Paint brushes are used to change things, usually either walls, patterned neggs, or Neopets. We don't know enough about the paint brush to say anything for certain, but the plot is called <b>The Void Within</b>. Maybe it's a "Void Paint Brush?" Maybe... maybe it turns you into whatever Vira is? If Drakara is one of the same faeries that turned Baelia grey, maybe the paint brush is for her, and faeries like her? Maybe it's for all of us???

<br><br>

And what of that "seed" that's ready to bear fruit? What's that? We went into this pondering the nature of Jhudora and Illusen's mutual heartbreak. Again, that's a question that's been raised and you should continue to be curious about it. But what if that "seed" was what Illusen witnessed long ago? And this faerie, Drakara or Jennumara or whatever her name is, framed Jhudora for it? Per that theory about Fyora except, y'know, with Drakara or Jennumara or whatever her name is? She cursed Vira, she Greyed Baelia, she broke up Jhudora and Illusen, she's just spreading evil in all things. She might be Neopia's greatest villain.

<br><br>

And if Drakara DOES have one hand on Vira and another on Baelia, that still doesn't take away Jennumara's involvement with Baelia. Meaning we potentially have both Drakara AND Jennumara to deal with. Maybe even more. A gathering of faeries to put the Sisters to shame and show Neopia terrors out of thought and time. Terrors too foreign to defend against. But who would know these terrors more intimately than those who have survived them? Baelia, maybe even Vira, we may come to rely on them soon. Come to know them better. Come to know what they were like before trauma took them. If Drakara really did have a hand in Greying Baelia, and if Drakara really does intend to wither the Earth and Water Faeries, maybe thay means Baelia used to be an Earth Faerie? And Vira, what did she look like?

<br><br>

Food for thought for the time being. Until the next update, watch your back and stay warm over the coming holidays. A long and dreadful winter seems to be on the way.

<br><ul><li>Do not adjust your calendar, it is October 18th. The 18th, not the 19th. But if you were to visit the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faeriefestival/index.phtml">Faerie Festival</a> today you'd probably say something to the effect of "It's over? I thought we had one more day."

Illusen wins the Big Help. And just like that, depending on your performance you should get your team avatar, and some of those final prizes we saw on the 9th. It certainly seems like, SEEMS like, this is over? At least on paper?

Now, as of today there's suspicion that some of these prize rewardings might be glitched. So we don't know for sure how to get all of these, but the "achievements" so to speak seem to be...

It's still early goings, so we're waiting for any potential glitches to be acknowledged and ironed out. It's nothing new, business as usual in Neopia.

</li>

<br><br><li>We were told <a href="//www.neopets.com/quests.phtml">Faerie Quests</a> would last until the 19th, but that ended early. So it wouldn't be unheard of for this to end early thanks to some... sort of mistake or miscommunication. For that, maybe just stay tuned to see what they say about that. Maybe we'll get a slight extension. Or an official acknowledgment saying "Yes, it ended on such and such date, it's truly over."

<br><br>

But even if the battle is over, the war has not even begun. There are still unanswered questions. Most glaring of all probably being "who's at the top?" To say nothing of the issue of the enfeebling of the Earth and Water Faeries. Jhudora's potion and Illusen's spell surely didn't solve pollution once and for all, otherwise why have us recycle? No, this is not over. We might be "done for now," but this is not "resolved." So does that seal the deal that this is totally leading into <b>The Void Within</b>? Maybe this was simply setting the stage for the REAL battle to come? The question of who's behind this has been raised. Even if this doesn't lead into the plot, we can't stop asking until we get our answers. 

<br><br>

The FAQ said the 19th. So who knows, maybe we'll get a post-credits scene or something. But stay curious. Always stay curious.

<br><ul><li>Final day of play, sports fans! Get thee to a <a href="//www.neopets.com/faeriefestival/index.phtml">Faerie Festival</a> where you'll hear your boss say...

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7uQmji0.png" width="80" alt="Illusen" title="Illusen"><b> I heard Jhudora left her Festival some time ago and has yet to return. I'm starting to worry that she might be in trouble… Would you mind looking around for her? I heard she was last seen poking around Deep Catacombs under Neopia Central.</b>

<br><br>

Deep Catacombs. Confusing even to the savvy Neopian. The savvy Neopian will recall that all the shops and features of the original <a href="//www.neopets.com/art/">Deep Catacombs</a> were either left to stand alone, or moved to <a href="//www.neopets.com/worlds/index_roo.phtml">Roo Island</a>. Not Neopia Central. But there's one place from the Deep Catacombs that didn't move to Roo Island: <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop&amp;obj_type=68">Collectable Coins</a>.

Click him, and a cutscene starts. Though it's set in the Coin Shop, the backdrop makes it look like it's set in Meridell.

Maybe a last minute change? Events like these are known for them. Malkus may have originally intended to disguise himself as Snargan from <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/doubleornothing.phtml">Double or Nothing</a>. Snargan is also a Skeith who deals in coins, and what's more he's green. Anyway, confront the façade. It's time for some Bad Cop, Bad Cop. There's only the one cop. Jhudora.

Jhudora's sweating bullets. It's time to be a hero. But... we weren't told where to find Illusen! You could check the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faeriefestival/index.phtml">Festival</a>, but nothing's happening there. No, you're just gonna have to get lucky and guess that <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/index.phtml">Meridell</a> is the place Illusen is right now. About to be bottled.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Bs6grP0.png" width="80" alt="Illusen" title="Illusen"><b>Let's return to Faerieland. We will tell her, together.</b></li>

<br><br><li>The heat is truly on now. First of all, Malkus is now a lobbyist. A lobbyist and a venture capitalist! He's been doing well off camera. So that's his role in the villainy explained: He's after money just like Monty is after money. Which means, as Malkus revealed... <i>the ladder goes higher.</i> Malkus controls Monty, but who controls Malkus? Who would poison all Earth and Water Faeries? Is it because they simply hate Earth and/or Water Faeries? Or do Earth and Water Faeries simply stand in the way of their glorious, obsidian-powered new Neopia?

<br><br><b>It came from the very top</b>, said Malkus. Speculation abounds on <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=7">Board 7</a>. Who is at "the very top?" Easy answer is Sloth. Tech is his thing, right? And he is a person of authority and a cunning mind. "Very top" might also mean "Topmost in technological advancement," as <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=darconium">Darconium</a> points out. But most obvious of all, he's a known villain, the most notorious threat to Neopia. And he hates faeries. Which brings up an interesting premise: Someone or something had to free him. Maybe it was Sloth himself. Maybe the token can't hold him.

<br><br>

But what if... just what if... the one behind this WAS a faerie? Not an Earth or Water Faerie, that would be self-destructive. But someone, some faerie, who needs at least one Earth or Water Faerie out of the way. If only for this technological boom to "boom" without a hitch. Jhudora and Illusen are about to go tell Fyora what Malkus has been up to. What do you think is gonna happen after that? Let's imagine Sloth is behind this. What happens next? How do we discover that Sloth is behind this? Is he gonna be waiting in Fyora's quarters? We have us a little scuffle and then he runs away to 2024 where we have Round 2 in <b>The Void Within</b>? Or is it more likely that we'll bring our findings to Fyora, and it will be revealed through a slip of her own that she, Fyora, is involved? Running the show? Fyora is the one from the very top?

<br><br>

We talked about it a bit on July 30th, 2022: The ORIGINAL reason Jhudora and Illusen were rivals was no mystery. Not to the audience. The ORIGINAL reason was, Jhudora was <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=191">scheming</a> and no one believed she was up to no good except Illusen, who <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=192">worked to stop her</a>. There was no mystery, no lover's tension between them. Maybe over the years we've lost sight of that moved toward the misunderstood exes thing. But... what if the faerie that Illusen thought was Jhudora scheming was in fact Fyora in disguise? It wouldn't be the first time this trick was used. Xandra fooled Hanso into thinking she was Hubrid Nox. The Darkest Faerie fooled everyone into thinking she was Kaia. Yeah, it's Fyora who's actually up to shifty business! And Illusen stumbled upon it, so Fyora used trickery to make it appear as if she was Jhudora. Illusen, believing that her closest of closest would be doing villainy, goes and reports her findings to Fyora. And Jhudora is all like "You would slander me? Oh, you backstabber. We're not friends." And Illusen is all like "Yeah we're not friends because you're evil now." And Fyora, being the villain all along, says "These are serious allegations. We don't have any proof, so for now I'll just keep an eye on Jhudora." Jhudora suffers a somewhat tarnished reputation, and Fyora's machinations lie undetected.

<br><br>

Until now. Maybe now we're approaching checkmate. Because now it's time to get rid of Illusen and/or hear this new obsidian-powered world roar to life. Illusen is finally dying. Maybe because Fyora's plan is about to be complete, or maybe Fyora is lurching things forward to get Illusen out of the way as quickly as possible. But a world without Earth and Water Faeries would not hurt Fyora. She isn't an Earth or Water Faerie. Maybe this is why she stressed that Jhudora was not to go blow up any factories. Because Fyora wants the factories in Neopia. Whether poisoning certain faeries is an unintended but acceptable byproduct, or she specifically wants faeries like Illusen out of the way, either could be true. She clearly doesn't believe in Illusen's solar panel ideas.

<br><br>

Ask yourself this: If anyone was gonna have secret schemes but fool the world into thinking they didn't, who has the better chance of pulling off the trick? The stereotypically evil dark faerie, or the one who actually runs Faerieland? It may sound impossible that Fyora could secretly be evil, but surely many a Neopian supposedly thought the same of Jhudora, if the whole "Jhudora is secretly scheming" thing is true. That's the thing about subterfuge. You're not supposed to believe it when you see it.

<br><br><b>The tower is owned by the Moltara Obsidian Company, they've quickly amassed a fortune converting obsidian into liquid fuel for new machines across Neopia. I have some questions about their finances that I had better like the answers to.</b>

<br><br>

Malkus Vile! <img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/oh.gif"> At large once again? And Illusen's illness progresses. But she is so selfless, she dare not admit it. 

<br><br>

We can rest up back at camp, where you can touch base with your faerie of choice.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7uQmji0.png" width="80" alt="Illusen" title="Illusen"><b>Oh it's you, thank you for coming with me. I really appreciate the support. It wasn't easy to hear Jhudora say some of those things about me… but she has her reasons for lashing out.</b>

<br><br><b>Can you just do me a favour and keep an ear to the ground about Malkus Vile? I need to find and stop him. Soon.</b>

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vbqHVBO.png" width="80" alt="Jhudora" title="Jhudora"><b>There you are. Yeah, things got a bit tense there… that Illusen just gets me all tangled up sometimes.</b>

<br><br><b>But now I know who we are looking for. It won't be long before I track down Vile, trust me.</b></li>

<br><br><li>So, we have engaged the CEO of Moltara Obsidian. Monty McTaggart. A much needed Vandagyre character added to the canon. But one wonders, does this mean Obsidian Co was just for the Faerie Festival? And won't feature again in the upcoming <b>The Void Within</b>? We've reached the top of Obsidian's food chain before the plot even started. Conceivably, what more is there to do with Obsidian? Maybe Malkus Vile uses his considerable assets to oust Monty and take over Obsidian directly? Malkus must be after something here.

<br><br>

Who is Malkus Vile, you might be wondering?

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/tcg/cotd_dfaerie/0085_UV01.gif" alt="Also depicted, Heermeedjet and Meerouladen." title="Also depicted, Heermeedjet and Meerouladen."></center>

<br><br>

Introduced as the villain in <a href="//www.neopets.com/desert/crown_solution.phtml">The Hunt for the Crown</a>, Malkus Vile is your typical scheming, scamming, hustling, hard-boiled crime lord. Also, he used to be yellow.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/neopedia/58_meeting.gif" alt="Taken from a defunct Neopedia article." title="Taken from a defunct Neopedia article."></center>

<br><br>

Notorious in crime circles, he was a guest of ex-Guildmaster Galem Darkhand's dinner for criminals.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/winter/logic_intro.gif" alt="Taken from a defunct plot puzzle." title="Taken from a defunct plot puzzle."></center>

<br><br>

After that he had mostly been seen on and off. You'd see him in an Advent Calendar animation here and there, he was behind some very desperate Neomail scams on April Fool's Day 2012, this is a man who is typically on the back foot. Greasy and struggling in his portrayal. So to hear that he's got money like this, money to make kings like Monty McTaggart, is at least a little surprising. Malkus is typically seen in dingy, scuffed clothing. If he had money like this, surely he could at least afford new shoes? We know where Monty got the money, but where did Malkus get the money? And why did he give it to Monty? What's his endgame here? If he's the true mastermind... maybe taking him down means this really is it and all of our Obsidian Co speculation has not been plot related after all?

<br><br>

And then there's Illusen. We've gotta bring Malkus to justice, but we've also gotta make sure Illusen is okay. If it really is pollution that's making Illusen sick, Neopia is gonna have to get woke real fast as far as renewable energy sources. Or so passes Illusen. Question is, will Jhudora take that sitting down? Or will she finally be honest about her feelings? Cast aside this tsundere facade and let herself be vulnerable? If Illusen is in danger, will Jhudora come out and say "Illusen, I love you, and I want you around. I won't let them hurt you." She was prepared to destroy the factories by force. Perhaps this speaks to very strong, but no longer very secret feelings for Illusen? Feelings that Jhudora, for one reason or another, is afraid to own up to? Maybe Jhudora should take her own advice as given to Monty: If letting her guard down sounds scary, let her just see if letting Illusen down sounds scarier.

<br><br>

The time has come to stand and fight for the things we love. Plot speculation, Neopia's climate, Earth Faerie crushes, and everything else.

<br><ul><li>Ready your banners, because the War of the Festivals is on. Upon visiting the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faeriefestival/index.phtml">Festival grounds</a> you are given a choice...

You can click May Be Later, but upon refreshing or clicking Fyora, you'll be met with the choice again. It won't be later. The war starts now.

<br><br>

But how do you make an informed decision? Because you must a pick a side, you cannot play for both teams. Fortunately, both teams offer a preview of what's at stake in their respective prize hoards. Here's what you get if you're considering Illusen...

Painful how we can't have it all. But we will cover both sides here...

Depending on which Festival you sign up for, you'll get some dialogue from your hostess. First, Illusen.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Bs6grP0.png" width="80" alt="Illusen" title="Illusen"><b>Since Fyora wanted us to use this Faerie Festival as an opportunity to clean up Neopia, I had the idea to start up a recycling program! Taking a page from Granny Hopbobbin's book, I've decided to offer special prizes to festival goers who pick up garbage all over to help us rejuvenate the lovely land of Neopia.</b>

<br><br>

Click her again, and she says this...

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Bs6grP0.png" width="80" alt="Illusen" title="Illusen"><b> I was feeling a little under the weather this morning, so I asked some charming little Woodland Petpets to help me construct this treehouse base of operations for the festival this year! I think it looks just delightful, don't you?</b>

<br><br>

Over on Jhudora's side of the battlefield...

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LnItC3P.png" width="80" alt="Jhudora" title="Jhudora"><b>By the way, I heard Illusen is offering prizes for garbage at her festival. No really, I hear she wants actual trash! And since you wisely came to my Faerie Festival instead of her little tree party, I suppose I could offer out some special trinkets I've been hoarding... if you bring me more junk than her sycophants do.</b>

<br><br>

And if you click her again...

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LnItC3P.png" width="80" alt="Jhudora" title="Jhudora"><b>Would you believe no one has claimed this barely haunted gazebo at the edge of the haunted woods? It's just perfect!</b>

<br><br>

If this is their war, Neopia can only win in the end. They're fighting to recycle the most!

<br><br>

Prizes galore on each side, but there's something you might wanna know: Illusen is offering Illusens Staff as a top prize in her shop. But Jhudora, as midnight, is not offering Wand of the Dark Faerie. If you were assuming both faeries were offering their top Quest prize.</li>

<br><br><li>What you might've noticed in Illusen's dialogue is that she said she feels "under the weather." You might also remember she had a cough when she was talking to Jhudora last week. Chekhov's Cough? What is it that's got Illusen feeling sick? Just flu season? Or something more? Could something in Neopia be having some kind of deadly effect on Illusen? And other faeries, even? Something like the recent cybersmoke/smog? Are we gonna have to save the faeries again? Or maybe we're just saving Illusen and faeries like her. Maybe the focal faerie is Illusen, and the story long overdue for a resolution is hers and Jhudora's? Jhudora will be compelled by her secret love for Illusen to take a stand for her life?

<br><br>

Speaking of Jhudora, Illusen's second dialogue hinted at her being sick. Illusen's second dialogue might be an important clue. Maybe Jhudora's second dialogue is also an important clue? Maybe? Maybe the gazebo is some kind of important? Maybe it's got secret compartments or something? 

<br><br>

Otherwise... Illusen's got top shelf weapons, she's got plot hints, it's all goin' on at Illusen's festival! But whatever turns out to mean anything, we will keep you posted here.

The "Charity Corner aspect," AKA "Recycling" AKA Jhudora and Illusen's warring Festivals, closes donations on the 17th. Not the 19th. It "ends" on the 19th, but October 17th is the last day you can give them items. So it's not 11 days of play, it's 9. Try to participate each day in case there's daily participation requirements!

<br><br>

With this, lines in the sand are drawn. Jhudora will go her way, thus Illusen must go hers. We're getting not one, but TWO Charity Corners. 

<br><br>

It hasn't started yet, but you might start seeing invitations like this on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/home/">front page</a>.

If you haven't gotten one personally, fret not. They don't seem to do anything. Clicking <b>Not interested...</b> simply causes the invitation to appear again upon the next refresh. Clicking <b>I'd like to help!</b> makes the invitation go away. But it doesn't change anything on the Festival page.

<br><br>

But reading the flavor text on each invitation is kinda neat. There's Illusen's invitation...

Fair enough, Illusen isn't the one who defied orders like Jhudora. Speaking of Jhudora...

You have to bring your own food to Jhudora's festival??? But on the other hand, it is October. And it's hard to compete with Jhudora's spooky atmosphere this time of year. It's October, should we not be turning our attention towards Halloween-themed things? Maybe Illusen is one of those faeries who skips straight to counting down to Christmas once September rolls around?

<br><br>

Presently there is no <a href="//www.neopets.com/faeriefestival/faq">FAQ</a>. But what we do know from this is that the Charity Corner aspect lasts from October 9th to October 19th. 11 days of donating. Consider yourself conscripted in the Festival Wars if you choose to participate.</li>

<br><br><li>We've speculated on the possibility of this... Faerity Questival... being a prologue/lead-in to the upcoming plot. And again, not everything that has to do with faeries is a tie-in with <b>The Void Within</b> just because it's about a faerie. But if this ISN'T a tie-in with <b>The Void Within</b>, that's still relevant information as far as speculating on what's in store. If the Faerie Festival is entirely unrelated to the upcoming plot, the chances of Jhudora and/or Illusen being the focal "certain faerie" drastic go down. So we can be pretty certain in ruling them out, narrowing down the candidates/making it look a lot more likely that the plot is about Baelia. Because unless Jhudora and Illusen are incredibly popular, it's probably not so that they'd star in not one, but TWO events that aren't related to each other.

<br><br>

But even if Jhudora and Illusen aren't the "focal faeries," that doesn't mean this Festival isn't a lead-in to the plot. If only in the sense that it's an event happening in Neopia, and Neopia is paying more attention to the events that happen in the world. Here's what we do know: Fyora has officially acknowledged that  Neopia is going through an industrial/technological boom. And it has produced smog that has clouded Neopia's atmosphere. You might remember that Mira and Kari were talking about this during the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a>. Remember? How Mira specifically name dropped Illusen as having wanted to talk to her about this problem? And now Illusen is saying that she, Mira, and Landelbrot have been working on a solution. Some alternative energy ideas that, hopefully, leave less of a carbon footprint. See? If nothing else, the Festival of Neggs has led into the Faerity Questival. If only because every story in Neopia is aware of every other story in Neopia. 

<br><br>

But perhaps more telling? All this stuff about technological booms hearkens back to when Obsidian Co./the mysterious <a href="//www.neopets.com/magma/index.phtml">Moltaran</a> tower appeared. And remember what <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop</a> said of it back then?

<br><br><b><i>Oh, a tower you say? How strange! Now that you mention it, I do see an unfamiliar building jutting out across the Moltara skyline... We have heard some rumblings that the influx of technological advances across Neopia has led to entirely new businesses and corporations sprouting up all over the globe. Perhaps this new high-rise is connected? Whatever the case, I hope we are lucky enough to get a peek inside soon. Maybe even sometime this year... ~~Aesop</i></b>

<br><br>

This was said back in February of this year, back when "a plot some time later this year" was the big content they were teasing. So, Obsidian Co. is definitely tied to this Festival. It is a product of Neopia's technological boom. That much we know. Whether Obsidian Co. and the technological boom are plot related, that's still speculation. But if Obsidian Co. is plot related, then so is this Faerie Festival. And for that, we should pay close attention. Because it would mean the battle for whatever threatens Neopia is happening right now.

<br><br>

It would also mean that this plot is about Neopia's "technological boom." Which raises the question: How much of an "industrial revolution" has taken place? Thing about the stories that take place in Neopia is, you don't always immediately see their effects take hold on Neopets.com. Give or take Obsidian Co. appearing on the Moltaran map. So, canonically, is Fyora saying that factories have sprouted up everywhere? In all Neopian nations? What technology does each land have now? Jhudora mentioned the factories pumping out "pollution machines." Would those be something like "cars?" If so, does Neovia have cars now? Does Meridell have cars now? Because as you probably noticed, each land has a theme/aesthetic, and in cases of lands like Neovia and Meridell, these themes/aesthetics depend on NOT having technology. Neovia, for instance. It's a 19th century Victorian type city. If you introduce cars, it stops being that. Meridell is medieval. You introduce cars, it stops being that. So... IF lands like Meridell have cars and phones and whatnot, does that mean we're going to see these lands modernize? Maybe in the plot? Will we trade Castle Meridell for Meridell Palace/Manor? Will Skarl stop walking around in regalia and put on a stately looking power suit? Will he be driven around in a bulletproof royal limousine?

<br><br>

If this technological boom isn't what the plot is about, then we should see this question answered before the plot happens. But it really does look like this is what it has all been leading to. This "technological revolution..." we first heard mention of it in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=946">Editorial</a> of Times Issue #946...

<br><br><b><i>That is an EXCELLENT point. Neopets is ready for a technological revolution. I'm here for it. Get Nigel a real car! We'll make sure we adjust the Neopian Times submission rules, but going forward from this editorial, technology is allowed in submissions. ~~Gutterfoot</i></b>

<br><br>

October 15th, 2021. And by July 29th, 2022, the "screenplay" as it were for this upcoming plot had already been written. A "globetrotting adventure." And what is it that seems to be consistent across the Neopian globe? What would unite Neopia as such to necessitate an adventure around the globe and not just in one place? A Neopia on the technological grow. Guess there's good reason the mysterious character from the plot teaser looks so sci-fi.

<br><ul><li>Brief bit of news, almost didn't even report this one. On September 5th there was a livestreamed AMA featuring the CEO of Neopets, Dominic Law.

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/fb_ama.png" width="450" alt="Unfortunately no new plot teasers from the stream." title="Unfortunately no new plot teasers from the stream."><br><br>

Someone asked if/when the <a href="//www.neopets.com/dome/">Battledome</a> would see new work. He didn't have very much to say about it as the Battledome is notoriously low priority. But he did say that he understood there would be need for the Battledome to work well enough to facilitate the battling that would take place in the upcoming plot.

<br><br>

Long story short: Battles are on the menu for the upcoming plot. Hence Dominic being concerned that the Dome works well enough for them. This is emphasized futher in the latest <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=991">Editorial</a>, where <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tigerium">Tigerium</a> makes another appearance. Asking straight up if we should train for battle in preparation for the upcoming plot. Staffer Sunpotato had this to say...

<br><br><b>*lifts dumbbell and does bicep curl* It does seem as though Neopia could be facing some formidable foes in the future... While it's always good to keep your neopets healthy and in tip-top shape, you might want to start training a bit harder... * chugs protein shake* Go Beyond! Plus Ultra!</b>

<br><br>

It was probably a reasonable assumption anyway, but now we know. Battling is definitely planned for the upcoming plot. So if you weren't prepared before, prepare now.

<br><ul><li>Neopets is at San Diego Comic-Con, booth #1129. But most of us aren't. Luckily for us, <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=glittergirl7000">GlitterGirl7000</a> was. And she's scooped an intriguing quote from one of the artists present at the convention: <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162405201">We've been drawing a lot of Hannah lately... just random stuff.</a>

People are already speculating what this could lead to. As mentioned before, not everything is plot related. But plots demand lots of content work. If your king orders lots of weapons produced and rallies a standing army, AND you know that war is coming, it's a safe bet that your king is gathering weapons and soldiers for that war. There's a chance it's for something else, but strong odds are that it's for that war. And so it is with plots. If your artists are busy drawing a heavy amount of something, and you know a plot is coming, strong odds those drawings are for the plot.

<br><br>

So is Hannah gonna feature in <b>The Void Within</b>? From what we know, she might be a good fit. It's a globetrotting adventure, and she is a globetrotting adventurer. There may be spacey/sci-fi elements involved, and <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/game.phtml?game_id=1252">she's been to the moon.</a> But if, IF this adventure is about Baelia, what about Tavi? She's an adventurer too. Maybe she and Hannah team up. Maybe a stalwart team of heroes is formed and they all get cool gear like the Aisha we see in the silhouette? 

<br><br>

Where ever Hannah's going in the next little while, here's hoping Armin is invited. He's very protective.

<br><br>

Bear with us, while you were busy <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/colosseum/index.phtml">Altador Cupping</a>, a few things happened that led to this.

<br><br>

Recently it was announced that JumpStart and its subsidiaries would be "sunsetting." An industry term meaning "going away." Shutting down. All of its subsidiaries... except Neopets. JumpStart and Neopets are still owned by NetDragon, it's just that NetDragon has decided to retire everything under the JumpStart umbrella. Except Neopets. Might've made a post about this, but per the June 15th <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2023-06-12">New Features</a> Neostaff stressed that this wasn't anything that would affect Neopets. So the 30th came and went without a hitch, unless you were in Jumpworld at the time.

<br><br>

Fast forward to today. San Diego Comic-Con is coming up, and it's been promoted with the tagline "The Neopets Era." Again, didn't think much of it. We were led to believe the "Neopets Era" was a nostalgic term for the early-to-mid 2000s. Didn't think anything "new" was meant to come from this. But then around 7AM NST, the Neopets YouTube channel released a video titled <b>A New Era for Neopets!</b> You see the notification. You think "This must be for Comic-Con or something. Okay I'll give it a watch." And it turns out that in losing a JumpStart, Neopets may have gained a "jump start" in its content production and brand relevance? 

<br><br>

Willow and Ivy announce a changing day for Neopia, with things like...

<br><br></li><li><b>New leadership, with content driven by independent developer Fluffy Dog Studio and ownership by one Mr. Dominic Law. Neopets is no longer owned by NetDragon.</b></li>
<li><b>Neopets, Inc. is now "World of Neopia, Inc." Future projects will now be under the direct control of Neopets itself.</b></li>
<li><b>A "Brand Ambassador" program, where... "key members of the Neopets community" will serve as liaisons between Neostaff and the players.</b></li>
<li><b>A new Neopets homepage to serve as a central hub for everything, set to launch July 20th.</b></li>
<li><b>Island Builders is being redeveloped/relaunched as an episodic adventure.</b></li>
<li><b>Neopets Metaverse will now move away from the crypto/NFTs and is being rebranded as "World of Neopets.</b></li>
<li><b>They're gonna consider just letting us use Ruffle to play the old Flash games, as opposed to converting them all to HTML5.</b></li>
<li><b>A 2 Million Neocash giveaway sweepstakes.</b></li>

<br><br>

Much of that is detailed WAY further in this <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162395047">TNT Message Board post</a>. Also included in that post? 

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/db6qPDU.png" width="450" alt="Whoooaaa..." title="Whoooaaa..."><br><br>

We have our first image of the upcoming plot! Give or take the tower in <a href="//www.neopets.com/magma/index.phtml">Moltara</a>. And a title! <b>The Void Within</b>. And? A slight delay. You should know by now that plans are constantly in flux in Neopia, the plot appears to have been delayed to early 2024. Guess that JumpStart shuffle had more of an effect on the plot than we thought.

<br><br><li>Speculation is underway again on <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162395182">Board 7</a>. How much can we get out of a title and a silhouette? Well, let's match it up with what we know. Or what we think we know.

<br><br>

First, the title. <b>The Void Within</b>. What might that mean? Well, first let's remember that anything can change anytime. But second, let's assume that this plot being about "a certain faerie" and a story "long overdue for a resolution" will NOT change. Baelia is still a strong candidate for this plot being about her. Maybe the "void" is "within" her? Maybe that's how Greyness works. Maybe there's a void within Grey Faeries that saps their energy. But it wouldn't be much of a plot if there weren't some grave crisis on the horizon. Maybe this void threatens more than Baelia's powers. Maybe it threatens her life. Maybe it threatens all of our lives.

<br><br>

There's also that silhouette. Let's try to get a feel for what this character might look like. Appears to be an Aisha? With gloves on, and maybe some kind of wrist device. And they're conjuring some sort of... nebulous... matter in their left hand. Could this be some kind of sci-fi/techy plot? Doesn't look like an Alien Aisha, only two earstalks are visible. But the hairstyle even looks like something out of Cyberpunk 2077. And to that point, remember how the smoke coming out of Obsidian Co. is named "cybersmoke?" Maybe the "void within" isn't within a person, but a place. A planet, even? Like Neopia? Maybe there's a void deep in Neopia and it can be found by visiting Moltara? And we're going on a globetrotting adventure with high tech influences to save Neopia from whatever is happening to it?

<br><br>

But does that technically make it a "space plot?" Maybe, maybe not. When <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop</a> was asked about Obsidian Co in <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=977">that one Editorial</a>, he mentioned an "influx of technological advances across Neopia" and "entirely new businesses and corporations sprouting up all over the globe." Maybe (though it's hard to tell without the lens of a plot to show us), advanced tech has spread throughout Neopia. Maybe this is the "New Era" they're talking about. You might've noticed on the Neopets Facebook page, the banner depicts some 'pets in sci-fi looking suits.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DphgepJ.png" width="450" alt="Just Comic-Con dressing, or something more?" title="Just Comic-Con dressing, or something more?"><br><br>

Originally we weren't thinking much of this "Neopets Era" tagline for Comic-Con. But now we have to consider if maybe this branding isn't just for Comic-Con, and Comic-Con is being used to promote a much greater evolution for Neopets creatively. Maybe the Aisha looks techy because a lot of Neopia is about to look techy and this plot will give us our first look. You'll recall Mira was concerned about smog in the atmosphere. Maybe the smog is a byproduct of a drastic ramp-up in industry and technology in Neopia? By companies like Obsidian Co? And maybe all this smog and industry is what created "the void within?" Turning Neopia's core into a black hole that threatens not just Neopians, but the whole galaxy?

<br><br>

If that be the case, who is our leading faerie here? The one not featured enough? Maybe it is Mira. Maybe this is a little bit of a spacey plot. Or maybe, just maybe... it'll be up to Baelia to rally us all against certain doom. 

</li></ul><br><b>6th May, 2023</b>

<br><ul><li>The <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a> is now drawing to a close. The enigmatic Bython has been discovered after an exhausting hunt for neggs, and the secrets of the universe. But before we could wrap this thing up and go home, a Neomail from dogged plot investigator <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tigerium">Tigerium</a> came in, bringing something to our attention.

<br><br>

In the epilogue of this adventure, Kari and Mira talk about what they're gonna do now that the Bython mystery is solved. Them being such good friends, maybe they can hang out? But Mira explains that she's actually got business in Neopia. See, another mystery is afoot...

She's been wanting to see me to talk about a possible pollution problem, and with all the smog I've been seeing in the atmosphere recently, I figured this was as good as time as any to finally go see her and discuss it." title="What? No... I just have been meaning to talk to Illusen recently.

Mysterious smog has been discovered in the atmosphere. What does it mean? Consider again Obsidian Co. in <a href="//www.neopets.com/magma/index.phtml">Moltara.</a> That tower is belching out smoke, right? And you might think that's just a coincidence. Inconsequential. There's lots of smoke and steam in Moltara. But looking at that "moltara_city_v10_HTML5Canvas" file again, we find that this smoke has a name: <b>cybersmoke2</b>. Not just any smoke, but "cyber smoke." 

<br><br>

Also maybe remember that <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop</a> said this plot will focus on "a certain faerie" that he didn't feel was featured that much, and a tale "long overdue for a resolution." To that you might say "But Aesop also said this faerie hadn't been featured often enough. If you're implying Illusen is the faerie of focus, is she really 'not featured enough?'" And true, you could argue that Illusen is one of the most forefront Neopians when it comes to the Neopets brand. But her story is also very much overdue for a resolution. Now, maybe Illusen isn't the "faerie of focus." Maybe she just happens to be included in the plot, and the "faerie of focus" is Baelia or someone else. But if she is the "faerie of focus," then the story overdue for a resolution would have to be her relationship with Jhudora, right? Or maybe the faerie not featured enough is Mira herself? What would be  the overdue resolution there?

<br><br>

Speculation abounds on <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162268394">Board 7</a>. A recap of what we know for certain so far: It'll involve a certain faerie that isn't featured often enough for Aesop's liking, it'll involve multiple Neopian lands, and it'll involve a story long overdue for a resolution. Who knows, Mira might just be putting on the tsundere act because she doesn't wanna admit the real reason she's sticking around is because she likes Kari. But one thing can't be denied: Obsidian Co is here, and they're belching out cybersmoke. Should we be concerned?

</li></ul><br><b>26th March, 2023</b>

<br><ul><li>Might be plot relevant, might not be, but it's safer to take note of it anyway. Couple days ago the new Times dropped, and in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=979">Editorial</a> we learn a bit about one of the candidates for "Star Of This Upcoming Plot About A Faerie," Baelia.

<br><br><b>Hey TNT! I have come with a question about the Grey Faerie, Baelia. What kind of faerie was she before becoming a grey faerie? ~cara_cara__18</b>
<br><b><i>That's a great question! Although Baelia doesn't like to speak about her past much, anonymous sources from Faerieland have claimed that she used to be a Light Faerie before losing her wings and powers... ~~Aesop</i></b>

<br><br>

A key issue in Baelia's story is what she was before she turned grey. If there is a plot about her, it would probably involve getting powers again and hopefully becoming more like what she used to be? And whether that's something she should pursue at all or if she should instead move forward? Something to keep in mind.

</li></ul><br><b>22nd March, 2023</b>

<br><ul><li>And so <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/lostfragments/">Lost Fragments</a> comes to a close. 

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sDr3knh.png" alt="Fyora" title="Fyora"><b>Well done, all! With your help, we were able to gather up all of the shards of New Faerieland that crumbled and fell to Faerieland.

New Faerieland will be thriving in no time. I hope to have it ready for you all to visit someday soon!</b>

<br><br>

Sadly, no word on whether or not it was a mistake that we didn't get our half day. They found time to address the <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2023-03-20">Varia Bomb glitch</a>, but not this. Maybe that means we were never supposed to get that half day, despite the scheduling making room for it?</li>

<br><br><li>So, was this all just a fun little plug for the Faerie's Hope mobile game, and an opportunity for a chosen few in the right time zones to get some fabulous prizes? Potentially. Maybe so many things are faerie related not because they're all related to an upcoming faerie plot... but because faerie themed content is simply very popular. But if this IS a lead-in to the plot to come, how? What is established for us by this event? What "story" has been told, and what story is there to potentially come? If this even is that side event meant to go along with the Faerie Questival, didn't they say it was gonna have a bit of story to it? Whether or not that story was meant to springboard a future plot, we should at least know what story was told here, right? If this was the Faerie Questival tie-in?

<br><br>

Well, if you didn't play enough Faerie's Hope, this event actually reveals to us some interesting backstory into how Faerieland itself came to be. Once the New Faerieland Fragments are gathered, Luxinia said she wanted to use the Gift of Calabrus to save her new city. But wait, Calabrus? Where have we heard that name?

<br><br>

Oh yeah, Calabrus the Cloud Aisha.

<br><br><center><a href="//www.neopets.com/games/neodeck/colcardlookup.phtml?colcard_id=309"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/tradingcards/lg_309.gif" alt="Whenever she is happy the skies are clear, however with her anger storms arrive." title="Whenever she is happy the skies are clear, however with her anger storms arrive."></a></center>

<br><br>

Per <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop's</a> M.O., she's an old character that up until now had little to no backstory. So what have they done with her regarding this event/Faerie's Hope? Well, have a look at the descriptions for the two prizes "Trinket of Calabrus" and "Gift of Calabrus." 

<br><br><center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/gif_gift_of_calabrus.gif" alt="Trinket of Calabrus" title="Trinket of Calabrus"><br><b>Given to Queen Fyora so long ago that not even she can remember using it, it is said to be one of the most powerful artefacts in Neopia! Unfortunately, it fell into the wrong hands many years ago and disappeared, but it was recently found on the only remaining piece of Faerieland in the sky!...but this one is just a fun replica!</b>
</center>

<br><br><center>
<img src="//images.neopets.com/items/clo_giftofcalabrus.gif" alt="Gift of Calabrus" title="Gift of Calabrus"><br><b>When used by individuals of great magical power, it can create land in the sky!</b>
</center>

<br><br>

The implications are clear:  Long ago, so SOOOO long ago in time out of thought, there was Fyora and there was Calabrus. Calabrus gave Fyora the gift to create land in the sky, and she used it to create Faerieland.

<br><br>

With this introduced, opportunities for exploration have now come up. Questions are now raised, questions like "How powerful is Luxinia to be able to use the Gift to save New Faerieland?" Fyora supposedly used it to create Faerieland, does that mean Luxinia, in being able to save New Faerieland with the Gift, is as powerful as Fyora? Or maybe less so because it's only a small chunk, not a whole Faerieland? Does being able to create land in the sky with the Gift alone make Luxinia as powerful as Fyora? Something worth exploring in the hopefully near future. If Luxinia is on a similar tier as Fyora, it would make sense symbolically. Fyora is the leader of Faerieland, Luxinia is the leader of New Faerieland.

<br><br>

With this, we also bring up the topic of a time in Neopia when faeries were new in the world. From here, we could explore more of that. What was it like back then? Who else of note was around, besides Calabrus and Fyora? Perhaps King Altador? Back in the days before Altador was founded? If Altador is still alive today, what about Calabrus? And with the topic of faeries being new in the world, we also have the topic of where faeries came from when first landed in Neopia. The book <a href="//www.neopets.com/search.phtml?selected_type=object&amp;string=Faeries+from+Paradise">Faeries from Paradise</a> seems to imply that they come from a place called "Paradise." Or if that's not its name, it's probably pretty... paradisical?

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ayd5Alr.png" width="450" alt="How did Faeries land in Neopia? Find out!" title="How did Faeries land in Neopia? Find out!"><br><br>

We've been talking all about it over on <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162174845">Board 7</a>. Events that are prologues to plots tend to be about introducing things that plots later explore deeper. What this event has introduced to Neopets.com is Luxinia, and the history of how Faerieland was built. A plot about ancient Neopia/the Faerie Homeworld and what relevance it might have to Luxinia and the modern day? That's a story millennia overdue for a resolution. But once again, it might just be faerie content for the sake of faerie content. We can only stay tuuuuuuned...

</li></ul><br><b>16th March, 2023</b>

<br><ul><li>It's March 16th, and unfortunately it seems despite how things appeared, despite the same-day completion rewards, they are not doing the typical day-and-a-half for <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/lostfragments/">Lost Fragments</a>? People on <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162161188">Board 7</a> are reporting being able to find more shards today, as if a new day had started.

Same-day completion is rewarded so let's get right into it. If you were in <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/index.phtml">Faerieland</a> this morning you would've seen a big Walein hovering over the Faerie City skyline.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/h0H4g7n.png" width="450" alt="If you've played Faerie's Hope, you already have an idea of what this is about." title="If you've played Faerie's Hope, you already have an idea of what this is about."><br><br>

<p><font color="#AF69EE">There appears to be something going on in <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/index.phtml">Faerieland</a>! An unusually large Walein is floating above Queen Fyora's castle. Perhaps someone should investigate that!!</font></p>

<br><br>

Head into <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/faeriecity.phtml">Faerie City</a>, and precariously close to the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/hiddentower938.phtml">Hidden Tower</a> you'll find the Walein, and a link to something called <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/lostfragments/">Lost Fragments</a>.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CrBznlo.png" width="450" alt="Note the Faerie's Hope logo in the corner." title="Note the Faerie's Hope logo in the corner."><br><br>

A city of faeries in the sky? Where are you? If you've ever played <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieshope/">Faerie's Hope</a> (available now on Android and iOS) you know what this is all about. But in case you haven't, you should know that since <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tfr/">The Faeries' Ruin</a> there are still chunks of Faerieland that haven't fallen. Yet. And on one of those chunks was a Faerie trapped in some kinda... weird pink crystal. Fyora freed her from her crystal prison, but unfortunately she came out of it with amnesia. Prompting us the players to give her a name. And the rest? Well, it's a map building mobile game where you build your own NEW Faerieland in the clouds. Which you can also name, but the default/canon name is "New Faerieland." And that's where we are now.

<br><br>

Speaking of default/canon names, up until now the amnesiac faerie didn't have one. The game wouldn't give you one. But this event gives her one. Her name, canonically, is Luxinia now. And she seems committed to keeping her New Faerieland alive, as opposed to moving downstairs like all the other faeries.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sDr3knh.png" alt="Fyora" title="Fyora"><b>Hello Neopians! I'd like to introduce Luxinia, a Light Faerie who was stranded on a piece of Faerieland that remained floating in the sky while the rest crashed down.

If we can gather up all the pieces, I can perform a spell using the Gift of Calabrus to save the island! But it's too much for my friends and me to do alone. If you could help, I would be eternally grateful! I'd even be happy to reward you for your efforts with some wonderful prizes my friends in New Faerieland either created or collected for me.</b>

From here you can search either the greater Faerieland area, or Faerie City specifically. Or you can scroll down a bit and have a look at the prizes you can win. Faerie Paint Brush... Shield of Faerieland??? Some of these prizes are bananas. Get in on it by by scouring for samples of Faerieland dirt.

<br><br>

Head out to either <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/index.phtml">Faerieland</a> or <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/faeriecity.phtml">Faerie City</a>. You'll likely have to check both. Your maps might look something like this.

You can either <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/lostfragments/">Bring to Luxinia</a> and go back to New Faerieland to check your current point total, or <b>Keep Searching</b> to close the prompt and keep looking for crystal dirt.

<br><br>

Can't find that last crystal? Pressed for time? Just don't like a challenge? What you could also do is use your browser's Inspect tool. Open it up, scroll down to where you start seeing <b>fh23-shard</b> and hover your cursor over it. Your browser will highlight the element.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3X0M2TK.png" width="450" alt="Will an event on Neopets ever stump players again?" title="Will an event on Neopets ever stump players again?"><br><br>

A la Festival of Neggs, a set amount of crystal dirt can be found per release day. You get five crystals per day. So after you find today's five, you're done until the next release day. Which will be the 17th because this is a same-day completion event and we get a day and a half for those. Event lasts from today to <b>March 22nd.</b> And again, today was just a half day, tomorrow is the official first whole day. So that's 7 official days of crystal hunting. Finding crystals on the day of release earns you 5 points per crystal. Finding them late only earns you 1 point per crystal. It's all there in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/lostfragments/faq.phtml">FAQ</a>.

<br><br>

So... finding all 35 crystals on the day of release gets you a maximum of 175 points. Find your crystals now, make your wishlists later.</li>

<br><br><li>But is it plot related? 

<br><br>

It's all still speculation at this point. But remember that Faerie Quest event they planned on having last year, which was supposed to have a second event tied into it? Remember how it kinda seemed possible that this was gonna be a lead up to a plot because why else would they tie in a new thing to Faerie Quests?

<br><br>

Well... potentially just to advertise Faerie's Hope. But y'know what comes to mind? Y'know who else's story is long overdue for a resolution? In that she spent these last many years locked in amnesia stone? Luxinia. Not "long overdue" from the perspective of a player of a website called Neopets.com, but in-universe absolutely. And what's more, she's a faerie. Just the clever trickery Neostaff likes to pull. Or this could all just be to promote Faerie's Hope. Either way, if a plot is on the way you want these prizes anyway. If nothing else? Free gear. For when the bad guys attack.

</li></ul><br><b>2nd March, 2023</b>

<br><ul><li>Turns out <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop</a> <i>is</i> the man to talk to regarding this plot. Did you know Neopets has a podcast now? It's called <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2023-02-27">Nosy Neopians</a>, it's hosted by staffers <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_willow">Willow</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_ivy">Ivy</a> and goes up once a month on the Neopets YouTube channel. Kind of a long walk between episodes, but if your concerns were plotly then you're in luck because the March episode of Nosy Neopians features Aesop, whose formal title is revealed to be "Narrative Designer." Also known as "resident loremaster." He's the guy who keeps the storybook of Neopia.

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/nosy_neopians_ep2.jpg" width="450" alt="Fitting name for a guy who tells stories." title="Fitting name for a guy who tells stories."><br><br>

A few bits of trivia on Aesop...

<br><br><b>Favorite Species(es):</b> Shoyru, Scorchio, Draik (he likes dragons)
<br><b>Favorite Plot(s):</b> <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/tfr/">The Faeries' Ruin</a>, but it might be tied with <a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/council.phtml">The Altador (Mini) Plot</a>.
<br><b>Favorite Character:</b> <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=99">Sophie the Swamp Witch</a>
<br><b>Favorite Land:</b> <a href="//www.neopets.com/moon/index.phtml">Kreludor</a>
<br><b>First Item(s) Introduced To The Site:</b> Wasteland Gelert outfit

<br><br><center><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/9mfvt89c/1/4.png" alt="He must like Mad Max too." title="He must like Mad Max too."></center>

<br><br>

As the man with the stories to tell about Neopia, do these favorites inform what types of stories he's inclined to tell? Maybe? Will we see Sophie featured in this plot, maybe?  On the other hand, these interests are maybe too varied. As much as Aesop likes these things, "Sophie vs. Dragons on the Moon" is probably not a cogent concept. But then again this is Neopia.</li>

<br><br><li>But what about the plot we're having next? The one about the faerie and the overdue resolution? At <b>16:49</b> they get into it. Aesop's words...

<br><br><b><i>Yes, I can talk about plots. We do have a few we've been talking about, there's one we've been working really hard on. We have a team internally that has been, for the past year or two, picking apart how we're gonna tackle it? And we're getting in pretty good shape from the narrative side of things.</i></b>

<br><br><b><i>I don't wanna give away too much, I definitely can't. I'll let you know now that we will visit a couple of different lands across Neopia, it's not gonna be just focused on one. It's gonna be more of a... global adventure. It'll focus on a certain faerie who I don't think we've featured enough? So I'm really excited to have them in the limelight. And we're also gonna be bringing in a couple other characters that have not been featured quite enough, as well as some really new exciting characters. And possibly some older characters that you may have only seen art of but never actually had much of a story about.</i></b>

<br><br>

Let's dissect this. First, it's a global adventure, not specifically focused on just one land. So if the Obsidian Co. tower is tied to this upcoming plot, and more lands will also be tied to this upcoming plot, maybe we should be keeping an eye open for more mysterious appearances/plot devices in Neopia? Maybe Kreludor very well could be a land featured in this plot. Speaking of features, the focus appears to be taking characters who are underfeatured and beefing them up storywise. This makes speculation at once complicated and intriguing. Because they're not going for big names here. They're going for names overdue for some time in the limelight. So it might be fun to ask yourself "Who do YOU think needs some time in the limelight? Who have you been waiting to hear from again?" But at the same time, if a character has been without features for some time, odds are you and we all don't even remember them. Because if you do remember them, maybe that means this character isn't "underfeatured" enough to get into this plot? Maybe it's not even about Baelia. Maybe she's too "mainstream" for this hipster plot. Grey Faeries do give out <a href="//www.neopets.com/quests.phtml">Quests</a>, after all. 

<br><br>

Long story short, it's a debate over which characters need the feature the most. One area we might look into? Characters that we've only seen art of, but never actually seen featured in many (if any) stories. Again, tough to get inside Aesop's head about this kind of thing. Take last year's <a href="//www.neopets.com/neggfest/">Festival of Neggs</a>, for instance. Brought back an absolute deep cut: Professor J. Kugar. 

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wXF1VmF.png" width="450" alt="Remember him?" title="Remember him?"><br><br>

What's he from? <i>Exactly.</i> But if you have to know, he's from the very very old <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=216">Neopedia article</a> about the discovery of Gruslens.

<br><br><center><a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=216"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neopedia/216_gruslen.gif" alt="Not as old a character as Celandra, but he's up there." title="Not as old a character as Celandra, but he's up there."></a></center>

<br><br>

Maybe a good place to start is scouring old Neopedia articles, ID by ID? Or how about the old <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/neodeck/spoiler.phtml">Neodeck spoiler list</a>? The original home of characters with art but no story. If this is a faerie-related story, maybe we'll see the Tooth Faerie? Talk about your underfeatured characters...

<br><br><center><a href="//www.neopets.com/games/neodeck/colcardlookup.phtml?colcard_id=251"><img src="//images.neopets.com/games/tradingcards/lg_251.gif" alt="Does she even have a Random Event anymore?" title="Does she even have a Random Event anymore?"></a></center>

<br><br>

But if you want the best chance of predicting who will be featured in what, first you need to know what the story is about. Take Kugar, for instance. Why Kugar? Because they wanted to tell a story about the discovery of the Talpidat, and a character with experience in Petpet discovery was a good fit. So to circle back to the start, what is this story about? It's a heartfelt tale involving a certain faerie, it's long overdue for a resolution, and it's gonna be a "global adventure." Start there, and branch out. Speculation is sure to get underway on <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=7">Board 7</a>, make sure to share your thoughts there!

We've got another tidbit out of the latest <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=977">Editorial</a> today, courtesy of him and reader <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tigerium">Tigerium</a>, who asks about the Obsidian Co. tower in Moltara...

<br><br><b>Howdy TNT! We've recently noticed a new (ominous looking) tower pop up in Moltara. Do you or the meepits have an intel on this rather strange occurrence? Will this tower be featured or accessed soon perhaps? ~tigerium</b>

<br><br>

And Aesop responds...

<br><br><b><i>Oh, a tower you say? How strange! Now that you mention it, I do see an unfamiliar building jutting out across the Moltara skyline... We have heard some rumblings that the influx of technological advances across Neopia has led to entirely new businesses and corporations sprouting up all over the globe. Perhaps this new high-rise is connected? Whatever the case, I hope we are lucky enough to get a peek inside soon. Maybe even sometime this year... ~~Aesop</i></b>

<br><br>

Discussions are still ongoing at <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=161978603">Board 7</a>, where Tigerium himself showed up to contribute. Now, it's still just speculation that this mysterious tower is plot related at all. But if it is, the takeaway from this latest Editorial is that Obsidian Co is a new company presumably in the tech sector. And that "Maybe even sometime this year..." really suggests it's probably plot related, as it's the main bit of new content on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/roadmap/">2023 Roadmap</a>. So what would a Moltaran corporation (that's probably in the tech sector) have to do with "a heartfelt tale involving a certain faerie long overdue for a resolution?" If the faerie in question is Baelia, and this is a tech company, maybe Baelia (for want of magic) decides to pursue tech-related augmentation? She lost her magic, she can't be Superman, so maybe she opts for being Batman? Because getting a new name wouldn't be the way to go? Or maybe Obsidian Co. is the very company that finds her new name?

<br><br>

But the faerie in question might not be Baelia. A lot of people think "tech" and their minds go to Sloth. Tigerium theorizes that if this is a Sloth plot, the faerie in question is Mira. But where does the long overdue resolution come in? Or the heartfeltedness? Perhaps the resolution is an answer to the question of "Where has Sloth been all this time since he was trapped in Mira's token?" And the heartfelt aspect is Sloth and Mira's burgeoning romance? Snarkie seemed to be a fan of SlothxMira, so there does appear to be precedent.

<br><br>

But maybe the most important takeaway is the "Maybe" in "Maybe even sometime this year." The Roadmap is long and fraught with charts unvoyaged for years. Neostaff seems committed to eating their vegetables before they have any dessert, so the plot is probably not coming until Release 0.5.4. And as of right now, it seems they're working on the Inventory updates in Release 0.5.1. So we're gonna have to continue to be patient. March will soon be upon us, and in all honesty there will likely be a dearth of content. According to the Roadmap. And it does hold <a href="//www.neopets.com/calendar.phtml">the most uninteresting day of the year</a>. But be strong. Obsidian is coming. And a lot of other things. Like spring, and the Festival of Neggs!

</li></ul><br><b>20th December, 2022</b>

<br><ul><li>Hot news for your Borovan Day brews. First things first, Neostaff was better than their word. Late last night they got an early start on their <a href="//www.neopets.com/roadmap/">2023 Roadmap</a> by launching <a href="//www.neopets.com/releasenotes/">Release 0.5.0</a>. Not just before the new year, but before Christmas. 

<br><br>

That's cool and all, but what does that have to do with plots? Well, there's one update to the maps they didn't explicitly mention. Check out <a href="//www.neopets.com/magma/index.phtml">Moltara</a>. Notice anything different about the skyline? Between the water tower and Town Hall? A mysterious building with horns that wasn't there before?

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/s18EoCG.png" width="450" alt="Moltara, after the big real estate project." title="Moltara, after the big real estate project."><br><br>

For comparison, look at the original Moltara map. As you can see, the building wasn't there until last night.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/r4cunXE.png" width="450" alt="Moltara, before the big real estate project." title="Moltara, before the big real estate project."><br><br>

Investigations are already underway on <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=161978603">Board 7</a>. And historically, a good place to start any Neopian investigation is to View Source. <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=rawbeee">Rawbeee</a> Inspected the "moltara_city_v10_HTML5Canvas" file and found that the coordinates for that building are designated under some new code titled <b>Obsidian Co.</b> Some... shady corporation dealing in obsidian?

<br><br>

Now, you'd be right to question what a confirmed faerie plot would have to do with a mysterious obsidian company. Faerieland is a long walk from Moltara. But this is too suspicious an update to ignore. Shades of the Obelisk appearing in Tyrannia. Lutari Island plot a dead end? Sure. Celandra featuring in the plot a dead end? Maybe. But to quote a very plotly avatar, "what does it mean?" Shenkuu didn't have a faerie before <a href="//www.neopets.com/twr/">The Wraith Resurgence</a>. Moltara presently doesn't have a faerie, maybe it ties in through that? Moltara getting its patron faerie? Worst case scenario, it'll go the way of the Spotted Xweetok from Resurgence, scrapped content that was at least at one point <i>meant</i> to be in the plot.

<br><br>

2023 looks to be an interesting fiscal year for this "Obsidian Co." From the looks of how sinister the building is, someone may be preparing to fight them. Maybe us. Maybe sell your shares now?

</li></ul><br><b>13th December, 2022</b>

<br><ul><li>Coming to you from the <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/wintercelebration.phtml">Winter Starlight Celebration</a> with an update on recent speculation/investigation on our part regarding the 2023 Faerie tale plot to come. Remember how Neostaff said Celandra might "be out and about soon?" And what with us having a faerie-centric plot soon we speculated that Celandra might be tied to that in some way?

<br><br>

It might not be a "plot," but the <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/adventcalendar.phtml">Advent Calendar</a> has been heavy on comics this year. And today's comic took place somewhere in Faerieland at Christmastime...

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/deRQFhw.png" width="450" alt="Celandra's had this job for 22 years now?" title="Celandra's had this job for 22 years now?"><br><br>

There you have it, an appearance by Celandra. One might consider this "out and about." Seems like this was the appearance Neostaff was hinting at in that <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=968">Editorial</a>. Not a plot appearance.

<br><br>

Does this mean Celandra won't be appearing in the upcoming faerie-centric plot? Maybe, maybe not. Neostaff has been nothing if not unpredictable. But it does seem like this was the original plan and Celandra intersecting with any plot stuff has not been penciled in... yet. So continue to keep an eye out, and may the New Year be happy.

</li></ul><br><b>21st November, 2022</b>

<br><ul><li>A stealth update before Neostaff heads out for Thanksgiving break. They didn't announce it in the New Features or anything yet, but they've released a <a href="//www.neopets.com/roadmap/">Roadmap</a> for 2023. Most likely tentative, as all plans on Neopets.com are. Spoilers for what might happen in 2023!

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/oYCPqCq.png" width="450" alt="Nothing for December 2023?" title="Nothing for December 2023?"><br><br>

Screenshot was taken tonight, as far as we know they might add to it or change it. But as of right now, the plot is listed on the roadmap under <b>Release 0.5.4.</b> But what does that mean? Does it mean they won't be launching the plot until after they finish everything in Releases 0.5.0-3? Or that they at least <i>intend</i> to hold off on the plot until they everything in Releases 0.5.0-3? Such is the ebb and flow of the day to day on Neopets. This is why they don't update the <a href="//www.neopets.com/comingsoon.phtml">Coming Soon</a> page. There's too much that can't be predicted to say for sure what will be for sure. 

<br><br>

That's why we keep track of these updates. Maybe we will get the plot after we finish our vegetables. Or maybe something new will happen between then and now to change the schedule? Stay tuned.

</li></ul><b>10th October, 2022</b>

<br><ul><li>Hello again, still no new updates on the plot or any events that may or may not be a prologue to them. Just a quick update on some speculation from October 7th. It would appear <a href="//www.neopets.com/randomfriend.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop</a> did not actually quit. First evidenced by his return to Board 7 today. To post the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=161859355">November Pet Day Suggestions</a> thread.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KGRNO1N.png" width="450" alt="The reports of his resignation are greatly exaggerated." title="The reports of his resignation are greatly exaggerated."><br><br>

Yeah, turns out it was a simple mistake on Aesop's part that lost him his TNT designation on his account. Probably'll get fixed at some point. Good news. Neopets is at least one staff member richer than we initially might've thought. But this only makes the mystery of why the Questival hasn't happened yet even more puzzling. They sent e-mails and everything, well after the breach was addressed.

<br><br>

And so we return to waiting for further updates. Until then, happy high holidays and fingers crossed that things get moving sooner rather than later.

</li></ul><b>7th October, 2022</b>

<br><ul><li>September has ended. You might've noticed that, so far, we haven't had that Faerie Quest event. What gives? Well, the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=970">Editorial</a> of Neopian Times #970 comes with a bit of bad news. 

<br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=unlaced_">Unlaced_</a> asked the question on a lot of minds: <b>What happened to the Faerie Festival?</b> And Yarner responded...

<br><br><b><i>Unfortunately, due to issues outside of our control, our development team has been focused on making Neopets safer for each of our users. Once these issues have been resolved to our liking we will move forward with the Haunted Mansion and the holiday events. We still have the Faerie Festival event planned and ready for development and we are very excited for you to see it once we can fit it in!</i></b>

<br><br>

So there you have it. The Questival is postponed until "whenever it happens." Due to issues outside of Neostaff's control. Yarner actually opens this Editorial with a bit more on these issues, responding to a question with <b><i>In 2022, we had items pop up that were outside of our control which pivoted our emphasis on updating security systems.</i></b>

</li>

<br><br><li>So, what actually caused this postponement? Is Yarner talking about the <a href="//www.neopets.com/account/breachnotice20220829.phtml">breach</a> that happened earlier this summer? Well... potentially yes. That was a thing that happened in 2022. But here's the other thing about that. They were dealing with that way back in August. Their "new" mission to enhance security was something that was underway in August, before they sent out that September mailer that mention the Faerie Festival/Quest event + bonus event. So isn't it clear they meant to do and were able to do both things at one point? What could've changed between then and now to prevent them from doing both things, maybe perhaps?

<br><br>

Here's something that's changed between then and now: Semi-prominent Neostaffer <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_mx_macabre">Mac</a> has resigned. On August 9th of this year they were appointed Community Liaison. But on September 16th they <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=161822264">announced</a> they were hittin' the road. 

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EkIJOZp.png" width="450" alt="One week's notice." title="One week's notice."><br><br>

Now you might be thinking "Well, what's a 'Community Liaison?' Isn't that just a glorified spokesperson? Was Mac actually involved in the creation of content?" There's a good chance they were. Neostaffers in this day and age are known to pull multiple duties. On top of that? We may have also lost <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop</a>. If you visit his <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=161790525">October Pet Day Suggestions</a> thread, you'll find that his account has lost the "TNT Developer" tag it used to have. As well as the TNT avatar.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Pgbemtu.png" width="450" alt="A totally powerless account." title="A totally powerless account."><br><br>

Is he actually gone? How much does losing the TNT avatar and tag have to do with no longer working for Neopets? Because as of today, Mac still has TNT powers on their account and Mac is definitely gone. So maybe that's a separate thing, and Aesop is still here? Just opting not to have an account on the site anymore for some reason? Because also as of today, we still haven't had one of his trademark Pet Day Suggestions threads. November is coming soon, if those threads meant anything to him he wouldn't just abandon them while also still working here. Would he?

<br><br>

So maybe the most affecting issue here isn't the breach from the summer. Maybe it's loss of staff like Mac and Aesop. The theory isn't bulletproof, for instance Mac said their last day would be the 23rd, and the <a href="//www.neopets.com/calendar.phtml">Calendar</a> lists the official recognition for the Faerie Festival as September 20th. So you'd think there was still a little time left for Mac to do whatever they were needed for as far as the Questival, if they were needed for the Questival. After all, Aesop had time to Edit this latest issue of the Times. If he's even gone. But if Mac and Aesop ARE both gone, what if they aren't the only two resignations? What if this is a bigger exodus than we know? Wouldn't that affect content like the Questival?

<br><br>

As it stands, not even Neostaff knows when the Questival will be. But so far no one's said anything about the actual carrot at the end of the stick: The 2023 plot. That projection, as far as we know, still holds true. So enjoy your Halloween and Christmas and other high holidays until the New Year rings in. Somewhere around then at the latest we should get our next update.

</li></ul><br><b>9th September, 2022</b>

<br><ul><li>It looks like news? Maybe? You will recall that a plot is on the way regarding "a certain faerie long overdue for a resolution." Well, in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=968">Editorial</a> of Neopian Times #968, <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=black_skull725">Black_Skull725</a> brings up a very, very very old character named Celandra. Fyora's maid.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/neopedia/24_maid.gif" alt="Would you believe this is a Gelert?" title="Would you believe this is a Gelert?"></center>

<br><br>

Featured in this <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=24">Neopedia article</a> about the Hidden Tower from <a href="//www.neopets.com/newfeatures/feb2001_1.phtml">February 7th, 2001</a>. Then basically never heard from again. Some might say "She was written for convenience, Neopia has evolved since then. If she were important she would've been featured in other stuff by now." But Black_Skull725 has more consideration for her, asking <b>So what happened to Celandra? Does she still work for Her Majesty? Please explain this important mystery! Thanks!</b> Stone responds with some intriguing hints...

<br><br><b><i>I'm sure Celandra is happy to know you are thinking of her! There's no need to worry, though. She is still happily working for and gossiping with Queen Fyora! Do keep an eye out for her as she may be out and about soon!</i></b>

<br><br>

Again, we're having some kind of faerie-relevant plot soon. And Celandra is a faerie-relevant character. Does this mean she'll be in the plot? Is this where she makes her return?</li>

<br><br><li>Or maybe she'll be making her debut in the upcoming Faerie Questival tie-in event they mentioned, which might also be tied to the plot? If you're not one of the many with e-mail issues that were locked out of their accounts by the recent <a href="//www.neopets.com/account/breachnotice20220829.phtml">security measures</a>, you may have gotten a "Here's what's in store on Neopets.com for September" e-mail. And in it they mention the Faerie Festival (plus Faerie Quest event). But they also mention what they call "a post-Faerie Festival site event."

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/QeU8bEW.png" width="450" alt="Another fun event to look forward to: this year's Faerie Festival will take place on September 20th. On this day, make sure you check out the New Features page for some new faerie-tastic surprises!  Also, stay tuned for a post-Faerie Festival site event coming soon! " title="Another fun event to look forward to: this year's Faerie Festival will take place on September 20th. On this day, make sure you check out the New Features page for some new faerie-tastic surprises!  Also, stay tuned for a post-Faerie Festival site event coming soon! "></center>

<br><br>

Now, there is somewhat of a semantics debate here. Because what we first heard on July 29th was <b><i>we are also working on a short but very exciting story to go along with the Faerie Quest events this year!</i></b> With "along" being the operative word, which would imply "concurrently." At the same time. But here they mention some kind of event that comes specifically "after" the Faerie Questival event. So... are we getting TWO tie-in events? One that runs WITH the Questival, and one that happens after? Probably not. Probably more likely the event happens right after the Questing. In such a way that "along with" would still be an accurate descriptor of the event. But keep your eyes peeled anyway.

<br><br>

We'll know for sure in a couple of weeks. Faerie Festival's official date is listed as <a href="//www.neopets.com/calendar.phtml">September 20th</a>. In the meantime, if Celandra is tied into this, what might this plot be about? How does she tie in? She's Fyora's servant, not Baelia's, not Jhudora's, not Illusen's. Maybe she and Fyora have one of their gossip sessions, serving as exposition for what the plot will be about? Some whispers in the faerie world that will lead to the plot's happening? Food for thought until the next update.

</li></ul><br><b>30th July, 2022</b>

<br><ul><li>Discussion is underway on <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=7">Board 7</a> as everyone becomes aware of the latest plot hint. In <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=161745427">this thread</a>, for instance, some deeper consideration is given to the "certain faerie" and the long overdue resolution. 

<br><br>

Baelia is a leading theory, but no longer the only leading theory. In that thread, thought was given to The Darkest Faerie, for instance. Where we <a href="//www.neopets.com/twr/theclearing/index.phtml">last left off with her</a>, she had gone into hiding after being stuck with a magic ring (of her own making) that was sapping her of life. And her minion Reizo too for that matter. What's gonna happen to either of them? 

<br><br>

King Altador, who was supposed to be looking for her but somehow missed her return and re-disapperance, put up a monument to calm people's fears and remind them of heroism in Neopia. Bizarrely, he made TDF the centerpiece?

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/altador/altadorcup/2018/nc/map2018.png" width="450" alt="What place does TDF have in our history books?" title="What place does TDF have in our history books?"></center>

<br><br>

But that was back in early 2018. Is that really "long" overdue? If not, maybe the intertwined tale of Jhudora and Illusen is. 

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/caption/caption_779.gif" alt="Few remember a time before Jhudora and Illusen were on Neopets." title="Few remember a time before Jhudora and Illusen were on Neopets."></center>

<br><br>

For one, they were introduced even before Baelia. Baelia was introduced in April 2003. Jhudora was introduced on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2002-02-11">February 13th, 2002</a>. Illusen was introduced on <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2002-07-29">July 30th, 2002</a> with Meridell. And with her introduction the rivalry was established. For two, last year Neostaff released some surveys about what our favorite characters, plots, and so on were. 

<br><br>

1. Favorite Character Survey, posted to the February 20th, 2021 <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2021-02-16">New Features</a>
<br>
2. Favorite Plots/Events, posted to the April 8th, 2021 <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2021-04-05">New Features</a>
<br>
3. Roadmap 2022, posted to the November 18th, 2021 <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2021-11-15">New Features</a>

<br><br>

When you look at exit polls from the various places Neostaff posted these surveys and where people were talking about them, Illusen and the events related to her rank among the most popular. So if these surveys were taken to figure out, say, what kinds of plots to make? Aiming to include the characters and concepts people find most popular? It's believable that Illusen ranked highly in those surveys, maybe even the highest, and now Neostaff wants to give us what we asked for by making a plot about her.

<br><br>

In case you don't know what Illusen and Jhudora's story is, <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=191">Jhudora</a> is an evil faerie scheming some grand evil scheme. You do <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/darkfaerie.phtml">quests</a> for her, and you help her get closer to her goal. Originally it was maybe supposed to be some kind of secret that she was evil, but over the past 20 years her portrayal has changed a bit. The implication is that <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=192">Illusen</a> is working against Jhudora, offering <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/earthfaerie.phtml">quests</a> of her own to further her own goals of trying to stop whatever Jhudora's plan is. So Jhudora must also work against Illusen, to stop her plan from being... stopped. And that's where the reputation of their rivalry comes from. Nowadays (what with most of this story coming from decades old Neopedia stories) the details are forgotten to time and the two of them are mostly just know for fighting each other for mysterious reasons and hating the things that the other likes. Jhudora hates nice, cute things. Illusen hates mean, dark things.

<br><br>

But remember that stuff about portrayals changing over the years? Well, Jhudora (and dark faeries as a whole) have been shown in a kinder light. Back in the early 2000s they were all agents of evil. But nowadays it's a very popular take to say that dark faeries are misunderstood. That it's even an outdated perspective to say that dark faeries are more inclined to villainy than other faeries. This has also gone for Jhudora. Again, you can't really watch older Advent Calendar scenes right now, but over the years during the Advent Calendar, Jhudora was shown doing thing like baking heart shaped cookies and sitting around being sad that she's alone during the holidays. And yet, in public, every Illusen Day she'll complain about how much she hates Petpets and Cheery Blossoms. Perhaps she doth protest too much to hide her true feelings?

<br><br>

The prospect of a Jhudora and/or Illusen plot offers opportunities to address questions like "What is Jhudora actually trying to do?" Back in 2002 the answer was probably just "Become powerful enough and cunning enough to fight whatever forces of good keep her from taking over. Or destroying the world. Or whatever." Y'know, general big bad stuff. But if we're going for a "Jhudora isn't actually that evil" angle, maybe even a "Jhudora actually likes Illusen" angle? We start to ask a little more of Jhudora's motivations. Was she doing this just to have something to be close to Illusen for? Was she never after conquering Neopia, and her sights were set only on Illusen? Or maybe her plans for Neopia were to make a world more suited to her own happy ending with her and the heart shaped cookies and the non-lonely holidays and maybe even Illusen? Bear in mind, <a href="//www.neopets.com/randomfriend.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop</a> said this would be a "heartfelt" tale. Emotions of the heart are involved somehow. And what stronger emotion of the heart is there than feelings for another person? It's pretty safe to say that this will be a love story. What kind of love is the thing that's not clear.</li>

<br><br><li>But maybe it's a mistake looking for a story about a faerie that's overdue for a resolution. Or maybe we're being pedantic about wording. But the words were " a heartfelt tale involving a certain faerie long overdue for a resolution." What if it's a tale that originally was long overdue for a resolution, and for this upcoming sequel it'll involve this "certain faerie?" Would these words still be true? 

<br><br>

Because the question of what land this plot will be set in/focus on has been brought up in <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=161746871">this thread</a>. And if it's about a "certain faerie," doesn't that mean it has to involve whatever lands that faerie is associated with? If this is a plot about Illusen and/or Jhudora, you can't just set it anywhere. Can you? So maybe it's about some other long unresolved story, and there just happens to be a faerie in it. Making it much easier to set it in, say, Kiko Lake. 

<br><br>

But <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=1iberal">1iberal</a> is more interested in seeing it set in Meridell or Terror Mountain. How possible is that if this plot must be about Illusen, or Baelia? Well, Illusen lives in Meridell, right? And Baelia was kept on a mountain. Maybe it was Terror Mountain? Maybe that's where Jennumara lives? So if you're like 1iberal, you might be in luck.

But what <i>would</i> you like out of this plot? What lands do you want to see? What characters? In times where it's so fashionable to talk about the things you don't like, perhaps Neopia is better served by people talking about what they <i>do</i> like. What they <i>should</i> see. What they <i>want</i>. The only way to be productive, to be constructive, is to be the change you want to see. So take some time to think that over, and we'll be back when the next news breaks.

<br><ul><li>Late breaking development in the next plot to come. Not one later down the line, but the one planned to come next year. <a href="//www.neopets.com/randomfriend.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop</a> once again takes the question in Neopian Times <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=965">Editorial</a> #965. Saying...

<br><br><b><i>As for the plot, our narrative team has already mapped out most of the storyline, and we are tentatively aiming for the release of the first chapters next year. Once we get through some of the upcoming events such as the Faerie Festival and Advent Calendar, we will likely start having some of the other disciplines join us in working on the plot! Although I don't want to give too much away, I can say that the next plot will be a heartfelt tale involving a certain faerie long overdue for a resolution...</i></b>

<br><br>

There are at least two takeaways there. First, the storyline is pretty much all written/mapped out. Second? "The next plot will be a heartfelt tale involving a certain faerie long overdue for a resolution." From this, how much deeper can we speculate? Can we come up with something more specific? What faerie tales are long overdue for a resolution? There are a few tales that could be consider overdue for a sequel. But probably the longest overdue? Coming up on 20 years (especially when you consider this plot starts next year)? Baelia's tale. Posted to the April 18th, 2003 <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2003-04-14">New Features</a> in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neopedia.phtml?neopedia_id=179">Neopedia</a>. The article that introduced grey faeries to the lore of Neopia.

<br><br>

In summary, a "darkness faerie" (we call them dark faeries almost exclusively nowadays) named Jennumara managed to capture a faerie who was powerless, wingless, and grey. Held her on a mountain somewhere, in a cage with a magic lock. Watched over by her shadow minions. When one day a mountain climber named Tavi arrived. And she's all like "Who are you?" The grey faerie tries to answer, but can't for some reason. The grey faerie then looks at the lock and is all like "Help me! Rescue me!" Tavi is all like "How?" And the grey faerie is all like "This lock is magic. Whisper the lock's name and it will open." And Tavi is all like "So what's the lock's name?" And the grey faerie says "I can't say."

<br><br>

The lock taunts Tavi. But in a game of riddles, Tavi figures out the lock's name. Tavi asks the lock what the faerie's name is. Which you probably know by now is Baelia. Tavi's gambit was that the lock was named after Baelia, and some kind of magic kept Baelia from saying her own name and opening the lock. Which is why she didn't give her name when asked, but looked at the lock as if to say "It's that, but I can't say it. Check with the lock." Fast friends, Tavi and Baelia conspire to escape and elude the pursuit of Jennumara, for she will be pretty mad to find Baelia missing. But before they make their getaway, Baelia explains one of the defining lore aspects of grey faeries. Or at least Baelia: She lacks the powers and celestial bearing of a faerie without her wings. And in order to get new wings, she needs a new name. Tavi closes this story with a question unanswered for longer than many Neopians have been alive: Exactly how do we do that?

<br><br>

There's a few unanswered questions here that a potential Baelia plot could answer. How does Baelia get a new name? What does it actually "mean" for a grey faerie to get a new name? Are there consequences? Does she lose her old identity/memories or something? How do you turn a faerie grey anyway? Is Baelia still unable to say the name "Baelia" or was that just for the lock? Who is Jennumara and why did she capture Baelia? Is Jennumara a threat to Neopia like other villains? Would we be fighting her?</li> 

<br><br><li>In that same <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=965">Editorial</a> we are also told that we're getting a Faerie Quest event not next year, but THIS year. In September, around the Faerie Festival.

<br><br><b><i>Yes we are planning on having a small Faerie Quest event around the Faerie Festival this year. Although it might be less expansive than Faerie Festivals in the past, we are also working on a short but very exciting story to go along with the Faerie Quest events this year!</i></b>

<br><br>

Now you might be saying "But they said we'd be getting a Faerie Quest Event last year and that didn't pan out." And you'd be right. But if all goes according to plan, could this Faerie Quest Event be a tie-in/prologue to this "faerie's resolution" story? After all, <a href="//www.neopets.com/twr/">The Wraith Resurgence</a> had that. The "plot official," as in "Chapter 1," was considered to have started well after that year's Faerie Festival when the attack happened. By a technicality, the Faerie Festival wasn't "part of the plot," its dialogue isn't included in the story chapters. Even though that's when the thing that started the plot happened. So it can be considered sort of a prologue. And if this is a story about a faerie getting resolution, what better time to have a prologue style event than during the Faerie Festival? A time for revisiting faerie Neopians and catching up with what they've been up to in the world? 

<br><br>

So there might be things of relevance to follow as early as September of this year. Maybe not plot steps, but bits and pieces of story. Or clues to look at. In light of this, we've restructured with our eyes set on future faerie happenings. The time is coming soon to make good on overdue debts...

</li></ul><br><b>17th June, 2022...</b>

<br><ul><li>Disregard our speculation earlier. In the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;week=962">Editorial</a> for Neopian Times #962, Neostaff lays out a concrete, speculation-free projection of their goals as far as plots. 

<br><br>

An anonymous writer asks <b>I remember that a few editorials ago, there was a mention that a plot was in the works, and it was about Lutari Island, is that still being worked on or has it been shelved?</b> And <a href="//www.neopets.com/randomfriend.phtml?user=tnt_aesop">Aesop</a> replies...

<br><br><b><i>So happy you asked this question! We are actually working on planning out multiple plots right now that I am incredibly excited about :D These do take a long time to put together, but we are tentatively aiming to release the first of these new plots next year. Although the Lutari Island plot will likely be the second or third of these plots already in the works, I can assure you it certainly has not been shelved! And I'll be sure to keep Neopia updated as we move forward with these exciting new plots!</i></b>

<br><br>

So there you have it. The next plot, as of the current plans, is NOT a Lutari Island plot. One is planned, but it's currently aiming for the second or even third of multiple plots in the pipe. So if you were looking forward to the release of Lutari Island, you might have to wait a while.</li>

<br><br><li>In brighter news, several plots are in development, and Neostaff is aiming to launch the first of them next year. That's content developed, something more than mere wishing. So it is coming, most likely. In the meantime, we'll restructure and come back to you when more developments come out for this or one of the upcoming plots. Stay frosty.

</li></ul><br><b>11th June, 2022...</b>

<br><ul><li>If you've been listening, you know that Neostaff has been talking about starting up a plot someday soon, once their work schedule clears up. What would this plot be about? Most of the talk has been about Lutari Island. In the December 17th, 2020 <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2020-12-14">Producer Chat</a>, Lutari Island is mentioned by name as a centerpiece for a potential future plot. A staffer (probably <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_vandoodle">Van Doodle</a>) had been asking for it specifically. And since then they've been reminding us of how, someday VERY soon, they'd like to have one. As in these Editorial responses.

<br><br>

Which brings us to very recently. Evidence has come up that this potential Lutari Island plot could potentially be in development/actually on its way in the near future.

</li>

<br><br><li><a href="//www.neopets.com/altador/colosseum/">Altador Cup 2022</a> is underway, and mobile game <b>Neopets: Island Builders</b> is having an Altador Cup event.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ekcbf0N.jpg" width="450" alt="Hunt the Yooyu Capsules!" title="Hunt the Yooyu Capsules!"></center>

<br><br>

The premise of the event being, Dacardia Team Captain Tyrra Tamina was injured in the storm that hit Dacardia. On the year they were to make their Cup debut. But because of the storm, they'll have to sit this Cup out. If you haven't played Island Builders, you might not have heard about Dacardia's Yooyuball team. Fortunately, Tropical Food Shopkeeper advocate <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=derpyunikitty4_">derpyunikitty4_</a> has you covered. She was able to <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Pilikish">rip the Unity files</a> from Island Builders itself and get the HD artwork.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/evfvRzo.png" width="200" alt="A Kougra and Gelert..." title="A Kougra and Gelert..."><img src="http://i.imgur.com/RQR6HnF.png" width="200" alt="A Chia goalie, an Eyrie, and a Grarrl" title="A Chia goalie, an Eyrie, and a Grarrl"></center>

<br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MY1SUGt.png" width="450" alt="The same team as above, but darker and the Kougra doesn't have her badge" title="The same team as above, but darker and the Kougra doesn't have her badge"></center>

<br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tXsffrR.png" width="450" alt="Some manner of promo image, maybe?" title="Some manner of promo image, maybe?"></center>

<br><br>

One of these players is also the face of the <b>Team Dacardia Stamp</b>, a Neopets.com prize you can get for participating in this mobile game event. The Unity files say that Tyrra Tamina is the Grarrl, but this Kougra appears to be the face of the team.

<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/sta_team_dacardia.gif" alt="Team Dacardia has been practicing a lot in their free time and cannot wait to join the Altador Cup!" title="Team Dacardia has been practicing a lot in their free time and cannot wait to join the Altador Cup!"></center>

<br><br>

It would be one thing if the team was merely mentioned. But art was drawn for each player, and a name was given to at least one of them. Could Neostaff be serious about adding a new team to the Cup?

<br><br>

As we've been speculating in <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=161656262">this thread</a>, that would throw off the balance of the Cup. There needs to be an even number of teams so that the scheduling can work. Presently we have 18 teams, Dacardia would make 19. So, we can either have a team sit out the Cup like we used to do in the years post-Shenkuu and pre-Moltara... or we can add a second land and make it 20 teams. And what's that land Neostaff has been supposedly wanting to re-introduce for years now? Lutari Island. 

<br><br>

As it is with speculation, there's a lot of assumption. We're assuming Neostaff means to actually add Team Dacardia to the Cup, as opposed to drawing up this art for nothing. We're assuming they won't sit a team out for the Cup and will instead add a team. If these things are true, that means Team #20, whatever it may be, has to be ready for the Cup at the same time as Team Dacardia. Which means they need to be introduced as a world before that same Cup. So if Team Dacardia is sitting Cup 2022 out due to injury but will be back by, oh... let's say, Cup 2023? That means the land Team #20 comes from has to be open to the public <i>before</i> Cup 2023.

<br><br>

Put simply, if Dacardia is coming to the next Cup, and Lutari Island is coming to the next Cup to make it 20 teams, Lutari Island would have to have its plot and be opened to the world before the next Cup. A plot within the year. Maybe even later this year.

<br><br>

Neostaff still has a great deal on their plate, and they always talked about having a plot only when they had some time to spare. Maybe now's the time to find some time? If nothing else, right now Lutari Island is the land getting teased the most for the next plot. Watch this space.
