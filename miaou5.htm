<h1><a name="home">→ RUBBISH.</a></h1>
<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/rubbish.gif"><br><br><h2>▸HOW TO GET THE AVATAR</h2>

<p>1. Discard between <i>12-1 NST</i>. AM or PM doesn't seem to matter.*

</p>
<p>2. Collect at least 4000 junk items before you begin. Any item works. Store in your SDB.

</p>
<p>3. Take items out from your SDB 700 at a time. (This is mainly to prevent your inventory from clogging.)

</p>
<p>4. Discard 70 items at a time using quick stock. 

</p>
<p><b>*IMPORTANT</b>: If you don't get the avatar the first time (aka you've discarded 3k+ items), try switching to the opposite AM/PM. E.g., if you don't get it from 12-1 AM, try switching to 12-1 PM. So far 5 people have gotten the avatar by switching their times. (Not sure why exactly it seems to work, but ...)

</p>
<p>Note: Steps 3-4 are flexible; you can take out as many items from your SDB as you want, but more than 700 items tends to make the inventory page lag. You also don't need to discard 70 at a time, although that seems to be the quickest way to get the avatar.

</p>
<p>So far: As of June 2012, 97% of people who have tried this method have gotten the avatar. Thank you for sending in results! Keep 'em coming.

</p>
<p>Average number of items discarded before getting the avatar: 2000-3000

</p>

<br><br><h2>▸THEORY &amp; DATA: POSITIVE CORRELATION WITH TIME</h2>

<p>I haven't had much time for Neo recently, so TYSM to everyone who helped me collect data points!

</p>
<p><img src="http://i847.photobucket.com/albums/ab38/justmaybeperhaps/rubbish.jpg"></p>

<p>As the cheap Excel graph shows, there is a positive correlation between the hour and number of items discarded. These are based on the results I've gotten from over 20 different people (as of April 2, 2012).

</p>
<p>For a while I thought that the pattern was that the hour + 1 = how many thousands of items you needed to discard--e.g., if you were discarding at between 1 and 2, you would need to discard between 2k to 3k items, if you were to discard between 2 and 3, you would need to discard between 3k to 4k items, etc. (with 12 being 0)

</p>
<p>It doesn't seem like that's <i>quite</i> what's going on, although my initial hunch that it had to do with time was correct. Although I don't have a way of determining exactly how many items you need, I do know that it's easiest to get the avvie from 12-1. Average discarded items during this hour is 2k, and I have never seen it go above 3k (although you should collect 4k just to be sure).

</p>
<p>If you have any more results, please send them in! The more data the better. C: Thanks bunches people!!
