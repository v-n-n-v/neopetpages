Welcome to my page of Blogs!  If you use one of these, a link back here somewhere on your page is appreciated.  =)<br><b>Note:</b>  Okay, so apparently, shops and pet lookups don't like the div format, so I'm working on putting up alternate codes, using tables.  If you want to use a blog that doesn't have an alternate code yet, NM me.  =)<p>For petpages, use the first code; for pet lookups, shops, galleries, anywhere the first code doesn't work, use the alternate code.</p><p>

Requests are:  <b>CLOSED</b><br>
I'm sorry to say that, for the moment, I just don't have the time or energy to make graphics anymore.  The premades are still free for all, though.</p><p><a href="/~oahuian">Request pick-ups</a>
