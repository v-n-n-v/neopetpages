<p><b>If you've gotten art from the users dusknoirz, gorubeza, OR krabbox, please link them back to this page.</b>
</p><p>If you are interested in my art, please read the status first. 
<br><br><br><br><b>NOTE: My style varies from piece to piece, but if you have a certain style out of some of the examples below, let me know and I'll see what I can do~</b>
<br><br><br><br><b>UPDATE:</b> Added an OUTFIT IDEA to <a href="#neocolor">Color suggestions</a>! I will now showcase my created outfits AND Neo colors in this section! :D If you like what you see, please suggest them on the suggestions board made by staff! Something as simple as "I'd like to see *PET COLOR*  or *OUTFIT* by shellshocks" would do!
<br><br><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hTl2S4Y.png"><br><i>Interesting, is it not..?</i>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Examples of what I can offer</b>
</p><p><b>NOTE: How the art looks varies on what I'm drawing; Example: I will draw more cutesy for cute things and darker for scary designs.</b> These are also when I'm feeling something that's not my usual style (aka, fullbody flats). These are when I'm a little more adventurous or just seek something different.


<br><br><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/W7QxpBq.png"><br>Manga style (character encounters can be in manga style or more like a photo/selfie; Please specify as manga will take longer due to becoming a comic and I would request you do the same to make things fair)
<br><br><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3xgTjuv.png"><br>Potato (colors vary upon design; The less colors, the more likely I'll do fully colored. QUADS AND ANTHROS ONLY; Not limited to felines, but no limbless creatures.)
<br><br><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/h3ZSodt.png"><br>Pixel (simple chars only for now, please; I'm working on anatomy with these - Also, it's not "real" pixel art; It's just me using the smallest pencil tool, not doing things literally "pixel by pixel". Apologies for any confusion regarding my lable for it)
<br><br><br><br>
||| <b>DEFAULT STYLE RIGHT NOW: None!</b> |||
</p><p>PLEASE ask if you want something else or you'll get what's default (if one's listed)!
<br><br><br><br>
||| <b>STATUS:</b> |||
</p><p>Requests: <b>CLOSED</b> unless I state otherwise (watch the Art Chat; I may open requests there!)
<br>Trades: <b>OPEN</b>/Closed
<br><br><br><br><b>NOTE: Art quality/media/style doesn't matter!</b> I don't need examples of your artwork; I have done trades with different kinds of artists and I appreciate everything they have done, whether they liked the turnout or not. All I ask is that you draw my characters by their design rather than customization. They're not pets in any way or form, even in the BC, and have refs for a reason.
</p><p>I also will not seek AI or meme/joke art, as I don't engage with the culture, nor do I support AI generations.
<br><br><br><br><b>I am also primarily a MOBILE / (old) iOS USER when I'm not at home.</b> Meaning, a lot of pages are inaccessable on my devices. If your art page requires hovering or a ton of loading to copy a pic, I will struggle and may have to ask you to put the pic on a different page. If possible, please put pics on either a blank page or a page that doesn't have a lot of images. My iPad crashes on certain layouts, unfortnately. :(
</p><p>Of course, you may inform on where your art page is and I'll still link there or to a lookup if you prefer. I just can't load half the petpages most of the time and it's a shame because I can't see all the artwork then.

<br><br><br><br><i>***I REQUIRE CLICKABLE LINKS TO VISUAL REFS ON PETPAGES***</i>
</p><p>Sorry, but I don't want to go through captchas and am very bad with descriptions, and due to the fact I'm normally on my iPad during the day, my copy/paste is reserved for my own ref links.
<br><br><br><br><b>I'm ONLY seeking FULLBODY trades; I want to practice posing, and encourage others to do the same~</b>
</p><p>I am best with fullbodies, but do not want to trade a fullbody for a headshot. I don't find that even or fair. I will do less body to make it even, but please note that I personally don't enjoy doing less due to inability to spruce them up or to draw something other than a face. Interactions are different and can be less; Just please no headshots.
</p><p>HOWEVER: I only do flat colors or monochrome for colored trades. I don't mind full rendering or uncolored lineart in exchange, but I can do uncolored lineart if you want! But those are preferred for fullbodies only due to helping me pose and otherwise working with adding detail.
<br><br><br><br>
Now that you've done that, make sure you follow these <a href="#rules">rules and guidelines</a> and we'll be all set.
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><p><a name="rules"></a>
<font size="5">Ze Rules:</font>
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hTl2S4Y.png"><br><i>This is where I come in.</i>
<br><br><br><br><b>Always keep the link and don't edit my code!</b> - I want people to know where they got the art from and the link isn't hurting anyone! If you receive art from another of my pages, such as <a href="/~Xacaroni">Xac's page</a>, do NOT link here! My coding will not strangle you in your sleep, I promise. Just leave it unless I say otherwise.
</p><p><b>Link me to a VISUAL ref on a PETPAGE!</b> - CAPTCHAs are annoying and I prefer clickable links and visual refs, preferably semi-clean with at least flat colors. I will not go by description. Trust me, you don't want your Lupe wearing white socks...<i>This has happened before when I went by a description.</i>
</p><p><b>Resizing is okay!</b> - I work on very large canvases sometimes and my screen is very huge, so I understand if you must resize the pic <i>by code</i> a little bit. If there's too much transparent space for you to handle, let me know and I'll crop the art for you.
</p><p><b>Don't take what isn't yours!</b> - Self explanatory. Just don't.
</p><p><b>If I've drawn for you once, I'll draw for you again!</b> - But I do prefer a new character every now and then. If you have another pet/character that I haven't drawn for you yet, offer them up, yeah?
</p><p><b>To avoid ghosting, I will be seeing your part before I start on mine</b>, unless I fully trust you (either due to past trades or because you're a friend). I don't mind waiting for art, but I don't want to finish my half and be ghosted without ever seeing anything (even a sketch!). I understand that real life is priority and it should be; Just please let me know if you will be delayed or away for a certain amount of time. I will do the same, especially around holidays and special occasions. :)
</p><p><b>DO NOT USE THESE FOR ANY KIND OF PERSONAL GAIN, INCLUDING CRYPTOCURRENCY!</b> I'm highly against Cryptocurrency and NFTs, and you didn't make the art! I will NEVER give ANYONE persmission to sell or use my art for ANYTHING, including NFTs. If someone claims I gave them permission to do so, they are LYING. Please report anyone doing this if you see it! I also do NOT allow my art to be used in AI generated stuff.
</p><p>Speaking of AI, <b>I am NOT seeking AI generated stuff as requests or trades.</b> Sorry, but my chars are first of all, not suitable for AI generations. And second of all, I want to see YOUR take on them. If I wanted to see what an AI could do, I would've tried one by now (and I never will). I don't care if you are only able to draw stick people or blobs with faces, it's YOUR art, not something picked off an innocent artist who I wouldn't know. :3 An artist improves on their works, they don't ask an AI to do it for them.
</p><p><b>Be sure to pick up your piece as soon as possible so I can make room for new art!</b> If it's not up and you haven't picked up my half, let me know so I can put it back up for you! I most likely hadn't had a response from you in a while so I had to replace your art with another.
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2QWEYUc.png"><br><i>And trust me, this has happened A LOT.</i>
<br><br><br><br><b>What I prefer to draw (in order from most to least):</b>
</p><p>OCs (humanoids/anthros, Neo and non), Custom/Unique Neo Design (ex: sparklepets, fanpets, basically not a generic Neo), customizations OR basic Neopets (ex: A generic purple Aisha, or a purple Aisha with onsite clothing).
</p><p><b>WARNING: Basic and customized Neopets will be submitted into the Art Gallery! By offering one up or my drawing one, I reserve the right to use it as an AG muse should I feel the need to. If you're not comfortable with this, please have a unique design or request something else.</b>
<br><br><br><br><b>What I'm best at:</b> Male aligned humans/humanoids, male aligned anthros, anime/pretty boys, non realistic mechs/robots, monsters, claws and teeth, armor, muscles (I hope), boots, <i>shadow creatures/wraiths</i>, fandoms such as Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh (to an extent), and Powerpuff Girls (I will NOT draw 2016 reboot based art! Sorry, but they ruined it and I will not proclaim its existence), villainous chars.
<br><br><br><br><b>What I'm decent at:</b> Female aligned anthros, mechs/robots with more details (like anime mechs; I've only drawn SD Gundam Force chars, however), reptillian quads, anthro canines/felines, maybe deer? (I enjoy drawing deer chars here, at least)
</p><p><b>What I can try, but am not as good with (ask at your own risk!):</b> Female aligned humans, super feminine designs, minor skeletons (like maybe a skull head), anything with ruffles or lace, super detailed designs, tennis shoes/laced sneakers, chibis and cute designs, Neo customs (Neo items are super tough to draw and you can't see all the detail!), insect/oids, quad canine/felines/equines, chars that are either very childlike or very elderly in appearance (they may lookg a lot older / younger, depending on the age), Mer-people, super detailed mechs/robots/armor (I'm still working on BattleBots art, for example), sparklepets with a ton of markings and color.
<br><br><br><br><b>What I will NOT do:</b> Overly graphic designs, NSFW/Neo, realism (if anything, I will offer to draw it if I feel like I can; Realistic animals are super hard, and I will NOT draw realistic backgrounds), anything without a visual, FULL BODY ref with OR without colors, real life celebrities or influencers, fandoms I'm not comfortable with (mostly anything horror or extremely graphic; The most mature I may draw is Black Butler, but nothing unsafe for Neo), hate art, non Neo safe topics, zombies (within reasons; I won't draw your stereotypical horror zombie), any amount of blood, full skeletons (unless I offer)
<br><br><br><br>
I will also draw couples and more than one character in a pic <i>as a trade</i>, but I would like to limit it at 2-3 pets/characters max per pic (3 only if it's something small, like a P2 or a small animal, like an OC's pet cat - NOT 3 Neopets or OCs! Otherwise it would not be even or fair for me as someone who only has 2 char couples), and if you want me to do that, I will ONLY take a multi-character pic. I have some choices for you and those would be discussed if we agree to trade.
</p><p><a href="/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=975">Characters CAN be in expressed relationships!</a> However, I will not draw or seek anything beyond cuddling or looking cute, due to the limits of this rule.
</p><p><b>Alternatively, I can do an interaction featuring a char of yours and one of mine!
</b></p>
<br><br><br><br><b>Got that all done? Well either find my board on the Art Chat or Neomail me at <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=shellshocks">Shellshocks</a> and I'll get back to you ASAP!
</b>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><p><a name="pickup"></a>
<font size="5">Ze art:</font>
</p><p><i>If I draw for you, PLEASE let me know when you've put the art up, and for crying out loud, at least put it on your onsite page? I worked hard on these pieces, and if you really loved them, you will have them up on your pages for everyone to see and find where you got it!
<br><br><br>Not using my art onsite is just wasting my time; If you retire an OC or adopt out a pet etc, fine, but please take advantage of my drawing them while you have it! It hurts to do pieces for someone, only for them to not be showcased, and <b>I'm not going to draw for those who don't showcase my work for them.</b> :/</i>

I've never used them in my life, but it's just been fun to try a new form of art~ This class happens every Wednesday, unless either the teacher or I cannot make it. If the count is not the same that's gone by over the year, that's why; Either I couldn't make it or the teacher couldn't.
<br><br><br>NOTE: Pics are not scanned; Unfortunately, the paper is too big for my scanner. :( I'll probably crop out stuff digtially in the future, but for now, ya get what ya get. My phone's a hassle to deal with, omg...

<b>Week 1: Just Playing Around</b>
<p>AKA: Getting used to holding the brush, figuring out how water works, etc.
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/G8YYdp8.jpg" width="800"></p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZcNjqRz.jpg" width="800"><br>Dark Xac is a strictly offsite char, and is actually the one Ultimo 00 was "born" from.
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/03gPFJi.jpg" width="800"><br>Expect to see a lot of Xac. :P
<br><br><br><b>Week 2: Gradients - Primary to Black</b>
<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UceFGhj.jpg" width="800"></p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/pFCze2h.jpg" width="800"><br>Also with a Dark Xac cameo~
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FbfMrU2.jpg" width="800"><br>We could paint stuff on them, apparently, as long as the gradient was the main topic.
<br><br><br><b>Week 3: Gradients - Monochrome With Color</b>
</p><p>NOTE: The one of Xac does not have blood on it; I just had a huge mishap with coloring and sadly couldn't fix it... :/
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9G3ISk5.jpg" width="800"></p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qyphJ2r.jpg" width="800"><br>That moment when the only good part about a piece is how you shaded a freaking shirt...
<br><br><br><b>Week 4: Gradients - Gradient Continued</b>
</p><p>This week has my fave pics so far!
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/41oyauL.jpg" width="800"><br>Xac and Fuzo~ I'm so proud of how this turned out!
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cGYpdwc.jpg" width="800"><br>And of course, Xac modeling~ Also proud of the shading, especially his top.
<br><br><br><b>Week 5: Monochrome + Leading to Undercolor(?)</b>
</p><p>All black and white stuff here. One painting was sacrificed for next week's task: Adding color to the monochrome piece.
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GMcm3R4.jpg" width="800"><br>Gotta have more Xero!
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dzNkgtF.jpg" width="800"><br>Hey, it's Dark Xac! He says hi, and that the paint began to run out since he was done last.
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UW2Omw7.jpg" width="800"><br>A dragon I have offsite; Dedicated to a certain scene from a certain cooking competition. Also my favorite season. :P
<br><br><br><b>Week 6: Undercolor(?) + More color in general</b>
</p><p>I wanted to do some more tests with color and black/white.
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vOAbjEe.jpg" width="800"><br>The result of that task. I'm kinda neutral on it; Some parts look better than others, but it was getting compliments from everyone so I can't complain~ I can say it was a success! My lighting is atrocious here, though...
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Aez5H2r.jpg" width="800"><br>One day, I'll give Dark Xac what he deserves! At least this one has more black than the previous one.
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1RuVvzQ.jpg" width="800"><br>I wanted to shade Ultimo 00 with just red. :P Also couldn't come up with a good enough quote that would also fit after "Acceptance...Rejection...", LOL. OG idea was to have Xac saying something like "you won't get it from me", but eh. This works since both are in a way seeking change.
<br><br><br><b>Week 7: Experiments - Halo Effect and Watercolor Pencils</b>
</p><p>The month of March was basically a "play month", where we just test out new stuff.
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vjTcnkZ.jpg" width="800"><br>RICKI~ It's been a while since I last drew him at all! I like his precious face here, just begging for love. Was trying to do a halo effect with his...Well...Halo, lol. Didn't work.
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/l2PioBC.jpg" width="800"><br>Examples of said halo effect, minus the square, LOL. I made a little moon~
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/OvxV4NS.jpg" width="800"><br>And of course, I had to do more Xac~ I tried out watercoloring pencils for him. Also the first time I was able to get more than a halfbody/bust of him done here!
<br><br><br><b>Week 8: Experiments - Watercolor Pencils</b>
</p><p>I love these pencils, not gonna lie.
</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TQxUdU1.jpg" width="800"><br>Xero was the only one with a full fledged piece, OOPS. xD He hadn't been able to come with me to class so I brought him this time and had to draw him.
</p><p><img src="http://imgur.com/wTfSbAu.png" width="800"><br>And Neo!Ultimo 00~ I wanted to draw him after someone said I should enter a watercolor pic into the BC. xD It was the one of Xac and Fuzo, AKA: Still My Favorite Piece.

Holiday Themed: No, thank you. They don't celebrate "mortal" holidays.
</p><p>
Things to avoid: Anything out of character, and meme art (I don't understand or involve myself with meme culture). </p><p>Tiny hints at romance are okay with my couples, but nothing unsafe for Neo. Also keep in mind that Xac + Fuzo and NIGHTMARE + Zero are ace couples.
</p><p><b>DO NOT draw Fuzo if you don't intend on drawing Xac with her!</b> My goal is to have only art of her and Xac together as they are a comfort couple, and she otherwise wouldn't be seen without Xac. Otherwise, Xac can be alone due to being a comfort OC.
</p><p>Otherwise, obviously no violence or non Neo safe stuff, and please use their given refs. I do not go by Neo customs or species.
</p><p>Also, Destructo, Xero, Xac, Fuzo, NIGHTMARE, Overlord Zero, DDG, and Ultimo 00 do NOT live in brightly colored areas, nor venture into them. They live in darker places with colors such as black/dark grey, dark purple, maybe dark red (not in the form of blood).
</p><p>It's easy to get Ultimo Destructo confused (sorry about that) with Ultimo 00 and Destructo, so I will also use the initials "UD" when I talk about him.
</p><p>
Backup artist: I don't think I'll have time, sorry. ;3;
</p><p>
Extra comment space: Xac modeling would be The Best Thing Ever, tbh~ Ultimo is a chill guy and will not resort to violence; PLEASE do not draw him as a monster! He's one of my rare "hero" types and I don't want him looking like a villain (I swear, I want him to be the redemption story he's meant to be, including in artwork). More info's on everyone's respective pages. I prefer everyone as their true character forms, especially the OCs, if possible. The fandoms are totally okay in anthro if you want, especially the BattleBots due to their lack of full refs and complicated designs. Otherwise, I'm excited to see what you do! Please let me know if posting the art offsite is okay as well; I host these chars on other sites and love showcasing their art.

<b>Quest 1 - Arrival:</b>
<p>SubZero had no idea where he was. Somehow, he was transported out of his Icy kingdom to this...Whatever it is.
</p><p>The area around him began to freeze, which surprised him even more. This was not an ability he had in the BattleBots universe.
<br><br><br>
Some strange creatures surrounded him, but backed off right away as the Icy king continued forward, freezing everything in his path. This place wasn't meant to be encased in ice! And even more, this bot looked angry.
<br><br><br>
SubZero heard voices and turned to see where they were coming from, but found nothing. He continued to look around, then rolled ahead once more, wondering why he was in this place. He was resting from a tournament, getting his armor polished and basking in the freezing air of his castle. Why is this happening <i>now?</i>
</p><p>Even his comrade, Spitfire, was still back at home. Lucky minibot.
<br><br><br>
The longer he went, the more irritated SubZero became. He didn't like this place. It was humid, and the surrounding greenery was scraping and dirtying up his sleek armor. The dirt and sticks underneath were getting stuck underneath his tires and even his freezing them didn't help -- The sticks just stuck out and jabbed into him more than the ones above!
</p><p>This wasn't what he wanted, not by a long shot. If he were to be going places, it wouldn't be through this hunk of nature. No, it would be either through his snowy mountains or through BattleBots City.
</p><p>And who knows how far they were from here?
<br><br><br>
SubZero couldn't take it anymore. His icy blue eyes flashed red with anger and he charged at a nearby rock, flipping it over with his weapon - also of which should be resting! - before a voice sounded from ahead...
<br><br><br>
."You're here! Welcome to Neopia!"
<br><br><br>
The scenery didn't bother Xac one bit. His world was dark as well. He didn't even mind the silence. In fact, he needed it. Those soldiers of his were super loud and annoying, and even though he ventured here for a purpose, eventually he just found it relaxing to be away from everyone.
</p><p>An object shimmered nearby and Xac saw it immediately. His keen senses were still being put to good use. As he neared it, he noticed it was just an old piece of technology.
</p><p>."Who uses THESE anymore?"
</p><p>Xac laughed and picked it up, then tapped a claw against it. Strangely, the thing still worked.
</p><p>Despite his wanting to leave the device behind, Xac had a feeling that it could be of some use. He stuck it in a pocket in his uniform and moved on, before catching sight of something else nearby...
<br><br><br>
SubZero was still unamused by his being here instead of on vacation. But the strange creature said something about "going back", and that's what he was going to do.
</p><p>He continued forwoard for a moment, then halted as something sounded beside him. He readied his flipper for a strike, but who he saw surprised him.
</p><p>."You??"
</p><p>Xac was just as surprised to see SubZero as much as SubZero was to see him. The two had a strange encounter one time and had a huge battle...
</p><p>SubZero prevailed. Big time.
<br><br><br>
SubZero's eyes glowed bright red at the sight of Xac and charged at him, but Xac leaped out of the way.
</p><p>This may be why he lost his vacation: THIS GUY brought him here!
</p><p>Xac leaped out of the way of another charge, before being struck by a huge breath of ice from SubZero.
</p><p>He remembered this move, but how was he using it out of his own world?
</p><p>."YOU DID THIS!"
</p><p>SubZero lunged again, this time faster than before.
</p><p>."YOU COST ME MY VACATION!"
</p><p>Xac had no idea what he was talking about. After being forcibly told to "never enter my kingdom again" by SubZero, he decided that venturing back to his world wasn't worth it.
</p><p>SubZero charged again, and this time, Xac wasn't going to dodge. He held SubZero in place with one boot as he replied.
</p><p>."What vacation? I don't know what you're talking about!"
</p><p>SubZero wasn't buying it. This guy was a threat, and he knew it. He just didn't want to admit what he's done.
</p><p>SubZero's rage became so strong, he managed to flip Xac onto his back. He prepared to strike again, but stopped at the sight of the compass that fell out of his pocket and onto the icy ground.
</p><p>Xac saw him staring at it and straightened up, hoping that he'd finally cool down. <i>If only, considering his name...</i>
</p><p>SubZero examined the compass closely, then lifted it with his flipper carefully...And threw it into the air.
</p><p>Xac began to shout at him, before the compass landed on his head before dropping back onto the ground - luckily still in one piece.
</p><p>."You--" he began to say, before SubZero cut in.
</p><p>."It appears you're <i>not</i> the one at fault." he turned toward the direction in which the compass was pointing, "But get in my way, and I'll send you back in a different way than before."
</p><p>Xac snorted at this, but followed SubZero anyway. Whether or not this was an invitation to come along, he didn't care. He just wanted to find out more about this strange world...
</p><p><i>But maybe he should've gone alone...</i>
<br><br><br>
SubZero and Xac continued, and finally stopped near a beach.
</p><p>Both hated the very sight.
</p><p>SubZero hated sand; It got into his wheels and scratches up his armor. He didn't like the heat in general.
</p><p>Xac hated the ocean. It brought back memories of his first experience with aquatic life. Sure, it earned his lord a new henchman, but otherwise, he didn't want to deal with that <i>ever again.</i> Plus, it was BLUE.
</p><p>At least SubZero had SOME hints of red...
<br><br><br>
Xac took a step forword, his senses picking up on another living creature, and extended his claws. The smell of meat filled the air and he wanted a taste.
</p><p>However, what emerged surprised him. <i>This WAS a new world, after all.</i>
<br><br><br>
This "pink Kougra", as his scanners picked up, seemed rather friendly for a huge cat. He wanted to make her an offer to join his army, but then again...She was pink. Pink had no place in his ranks. Such a sickening color.
</p><p>She mentioned something about "sleep", and Xac could only laugh. He was a soldier who could work an entire week without rest! He didn't need any sleep!
</p><p>However, it looked like SubZero was getting worn out.
</p><p><i>Such an inferior machine.</i>
</p><p>Xac sighed and took the object this Kougra was offering -- not like he needed it for anything except studying on this world -- and gave SubZero some of his energy to keep moving.
</p><p>The energy may had been too much, however, as SubZero zoomed ahead, freezing the beach underneath his wheels.
</p><p><i>Perfect. Runaway Bot.</i>
<br><br><br>
SubZero's energy never ran out. He sped through an entire forest before crashing through the walls of an inn, of which stopped him immediately.
</p><p>Xac followed the icy trail left behind, slicing down a few trees with his claws, before noticing the inn -- After seeing the hole left over.
</p><p>."That thing's destructive..."
</p><p>Xac went inside and saw SubZero sitting in place, seemingly smoking a little from the energy. He chuckled and walked past the Bot without saying a word.
<br><br><br>
Someone greeted him as soon as he reached a counter, and despite the pink tiger thing from before, Xac didn't expect to see a red-and-green colored rabbit in front of him.
</p><p>According to scanners, this was a "Cybunny".
</p><p>."Strange names." Xac muttered before the Cybunny spoke up.
</p><p>."Do you have a key?"
</p><p>Xac flashed his claws and dug them into the counter, ripping through it with ease.
</p><p>."THESE are my keys!" he growled. Now this world was getting annoying. So low tech and useless...And the creatures were cutesy colorful things! Where are the terrifying monsters??
</p><p>SubZero nudged Xac from behind, noticing the device handed by the Kougra on his back. Xac turned and swung at him, but stopped as the Cybunny spoke.
</p><p>."Yes! That's it!"
</p><p>Xac saw the excited stare and removed the device from his back. So he didn't get to study it. No matter. He'd rather be rid of that thing anyway.
</p><p><i>If only he could rid of SubZero...</i>
<br><br><br>
The innkeeper walked Xac down a long hallway, noting which rooms they were passing. Xac dug his claws into the wall and followed behind, leaving long scratches in the wood.
</p><p>SubZero followed slowly, still worn out from his sudden burst of energy, and glanced up at the claw marks left behind.
</p><p><i>That guy's destructive...</i>
</p><p>The Cybunny finally stopped in front of a door, of which was strangely different from the others.
</p><p>."This one's yours."
</p><p>The door opened and Xac snorted in reply, but stopped short as he caught sight of his room.
</p><p>The walls were made out of sturdy metal, which was strange considering the rest of the inn was wood. A long couch laid on one side, and there was a large screen on the other.
</p><p>."This...Looks like..."
</p><p>The Cybunny stepped aside as Xac went in, hoping that he was enjoying his room.
</p><p>Xac went up to the screen and touched it lightly with a claw, to which it powered on and revealed a map of the world he'd ventured into.
</p><p>."Just like the kingdom."
</p><p>These words startled everyone, and SubZero couldn't help but roll up to the entrance and peek inside. His energy was finally being restored to normal and small pieces of ice began to crawl toward the walls.
</p><p>Xac felt this and turned around swiftly, his eyes glowing brightly.
</p><p>."YOU! KEEP YOUR ICE TO YOURSELF!"
</p><p>SubZero backed away quickly, then turned toward the innkeeper and nudged her lightly with his flipper.
</p><p>Despite this being their first meeting, she understood what he was trying to say and took him to the room next door.
</p><p>."This one's--"
</p><p>A loud slam sounded and they turned toward Xac's room, noticing that he'd closed the door to be alone. She took another breath before continuing.
</p><p>."This room's yours. I hope you like it as much as he did his."
</p><p>The door opened, this time on its own, and SubZero could immediately tell why. The room inside was freezing, and the door itself was cold to the touch. He could feel the temperature from afar and peeked inside.
</p><p>The room was covered in ice, with what appeared to be a throne made of ice that shimmered brilliantly, filling the room with bright sparkles that danced around. Soft piles of snow laid around, and all he could remember was when he'd use snow to work on his flipping technique.
</p><p>He went inside, the cold temperatures making him forget everything that went on in this strange world, then a sudden familiar chirp filled the air...
</p><p>."Spitfire?!"
</p><p>The dragon-like minibot flew up to SubZero and landed on his head, spitting out tiny flames excitedly.
</p><p>."Somehow, he arrived here before you did." the Cybunny informed, "I'm not sure how, but he really seems to have missed you."
</p><p>SubZero glanced up at Spitfire and tried to speak, but couldn't. Spitfire knew he was surprised and chirped in response.
</p><p>."You've no idea, either."
</p><p>Spitfire shook his head, then flew to the throne and perched on it, signaling for SubZero to take his place once more.
</p><p>SubZero chuckled and gave the innkeeper a silent nod, to which she left them alone, and the door closed behind himself as he rolled up to the throne and finally began to relax...
</p><p>...While Xac was busy doing even more research on this new world.
</p><p><i>Or was he..?</i>
<br><br><br>
."You made it, I assume?"
</p><p>."Yes, Lord Xero. This world...Is like nothing we've ever seen. I will do what I can...To conquer it in your great name."
</p>
<p>A light sound of scraping claws, before a pair of red eyes gleam in the darkness.
</p><p>."Good. I await your reports."
</p>
<p>Xac gives a low bow, before saying these final words:
</p><p>."It will be done, My Lord."
<br><br><br><b>BC Theme!</b>
<br><br><br>
It's been a while since anything really happened at the inn. At least one new visitor came to stay at the inn, but neither Xac nor SubZero bothered to meet them.
</p><p>Suddenly, a paper could be seen slipping into both rooms from underneath the doors to Xac and SubZero's rooms.
</p><p>Xac woke up and stretched out his arms before sitting up and noticing the paper laying on the floor.
<br><br><br>
."What's this?"
<br><br><br>
He stood and walked up to the paper, noticing that it was a poll about something referred to as a "BC theme".
</p><p>Despite one of the themes interesting him, he ripped a large hole in it, and left the message "If you want this place still standing, DON'T BOTHER ME WITH THIS NONSENSE!", before tossing it back out with a low growl.
</p><p>The innkeeper came by and, despite seeing the threat written, took note of what was voted for:
<br><br><br><i>Mechanized/Robot.</i>
<br><br><br>
|||
<br><br><br>
SubZero was buried under a pile of snow, and didn't see the paper inside his room. However, Spitfire heard the light rustle and flew over to get it.
</p><p>He tilted his head as he tried to figure out what it was talking about, then flew it over to SubZero and let out a roar, surprising him to the point where he flipped the snow all over the room.
<br><br><br>
."Spitfire..! Why--" SubZero began to ask, but noticed that the impact from his flipper sent snow flying onto the minibot, and it brought him to the floor, making it impossible to fly.
</p><p>Spitfire chirped and handed him the paper, before letting SubZero scoop off the snow and letting him become airborne once again.
</p><p>SubZero stared at the paper, unsure what to think of it, and reread the part about it being a "Beauty Contest theme" over and over again. The themes were all intriguing, but he knew he'd be able to surpass in two in particular.
<br><br><br>
."Should we?"
<br><br><br>
He turned toward Spitfire, of whom shot a tiny flame toward one in reply, signaling that he voted.
<br><br><br>
."I...Have to admit I should've seen this coming from you." SubZero chuckled, "But I hope they don't mind my giving my thoughts as well."
<br><br><br>
He left a stamp on another, which was right under the one Spitfire chose, before giving it a gentle slide under the door.
<br><br><br>
The innkeeper saw the slightly singed paper, and despite it having two votes, jotted them down...
<br><br><br><i>Spitfire: Mechanized/Robot.</i>
</p><p><i>SubZero: Magic: Crystals, potions, pointy hats.</i>
<br><br><br>
|||
<br><br><br>
It's been a month since the poll was released, and Xac is busy researching the new world, until a notification pops up on one side of the screen.
<br><br><br>
."This isn't from Lord Xero..."
<br><br><br>
He tapped on the notification, and nearly jumped back as a huge banner with brightly colored text popped up.
<br><br><br><b>The results are in!
<br>The winner of the poll is...
<br>MAGIC!!</b>
<br><br><br>
Xac yelled out in rage and slammed his hands down on the control panel, shutting it off. Whether it was the giant banner or the fact his desired theme didn't win, no one knows, but the slam was so loud, it shook the entire inn.
<br><br><br>
."My plan...Ruined!" he shouted, turning away from the screen, "And to think I could've led an entire army of powerful machines..! But <i>noooo</i>...People thought they'd play dress up instead!"
</p><p>He paced around his room, grumbling to himself, then suddenly, the room grew dark and a deep voice could be heard...
<br><br><br>
."Perhaps you can still get what you want."
<br><br><br>
Xac stopped short and snorted at this. He knew who was speaking and that they were just using his emotions again.
<br><br><br>
."Don't bother toying with me. I know what you want to do. You're--"
<br><br><br>
A bright, green light shone in front of him, revealing a strange figure similar to himself, but donned in black armor and with two, sharp antennae on its head. The figure held up a huge scythe with a long, crimson red blade, and spun it around effortlessly, sending out green smoke.
<br><br><br>
."I can give you this form...This power...For a limited time." the voice spoke again, "You will have the power of necromancy, a powerful form of dark magic that can bring back the dead. But these aren't your ordinarily fallen ones...Take a look!"
<br><br><br>
The figure pounded one end of the scythe against the ground, and it could suddenly be seen in a graveyard.
</p><p>But not any graveyard...
</p><p>But the graveyard in the BattleBots world.
<br><br><br>
Xac watched as the figure knelt down and ripped its other hands claws through the ground. Thick clouds rose from the left over marks and floated toward the nearest tomb...
</p><p>...Before a sudden, mechanical meow sounded from underneath the ground.
<br><br><br>
."We can rule an army of machines. And not just any machines, but the most powerful machines to ever live! The world feared these fighters, even when they were lost to ones we have now, and we can bring them back to their former glory! Behold, the power of...Mecha-Necromancy!"
<br><br><br>
The ground began to shake before a couple of pink ears poked out from underneath, and a loud hiss was heard. A long, pink tail could be seen swishing behind the ears before a broken Bot with a strangely adorable cat face rose from the grave. Despite the cute exterior, the Bot was seriously damaged and it's face was ripped in certain places.
<br><br><br>
."Arise...Bad Kitty!"
<br><br><br>
The scythe slams against the ground again, and Bad Kitty leaps out of the ground, before shaking off the dirt and letting out a high pitched meow. Clearly, it was angry...And wanted revenge.
<br><br><br>
While this Bot didn't interest Xac - come on, it's another pink cat! At least the Kougra was big and threatening! - he couldn't help but grin at the thought of bringing back fallen machines.
<br><br><br>
."I can rule them all."
<br><br><br>
The figure in dark armor inched toward him, its loose hand outstretched and claws glistening.
<br><br><br>
."I can be in complete control..."
<br><br><br>
He stares into the figures eyes, chuckling softly.
<br><br><br>
."I will...I...Will..."
<br><br><br>
Their hands touch, and both nod at each other.
<br><br><br>
."...TAKE THIS POWER!!"
<br><br><br>
A huge cloud of red smoke filled the room as Xac becomes one with the figure. His armor became pitch black and silver markings shaped like scythes ripped through various parts of his body. Two sharp antennae emerged from his head and a couple of hidden blasters flared from inside.
</p><p>One hand's claws increased in size and turned a crimson red, while the giant scythe was held in the other. The claws on that hand remained the same, minus red streaks that formed along their tops.
</p><p>Thick armor appeared on his legs and heavy boots covered his feet. Sharp, red crystals aligned their tips and glistened.
<br><br><br>
Suddenly, the darkness was absorbed into Xac's body, before being unleashed in a single blast, shrouding the skies and awakening many fallen machines under its cover, and loud, ominous laughter echoed through the air...
<br><br><br>
|||
<br><br><br>
SubZero sat in his throne, relaxing with a pile of ice on his head, until the familiar rustle of flying paper sounded from underneath his door.
</p><p>He had to admit, it felt rather bad that the innkeeper had to do this for him.
</p><p>He went over to it and lifted it lightly with his flipper, to which it fell onto his face. All he could then read was this:
</p><p>."Th--me ch--en...MA-IC!!"
<br><br><br>
."Spitfire..." he began to say, but Spitfire was already there, removing the paper from his face.
</p><p>Spitfire hovered with the paper in his mouth, careful not to burn it, and SubZero finally read what it was supposed to say.
<br><br><br>
."Looks like the Magic theme won."
<br><br><br>
At this, Spitfire dropped the piece and read it, then screeched in despair. He really wanted to show himself off...But SubZero didn't seem to mind, and he quieted down to soft chirps.
<br><br><br>
."Hm? What's this?"
<br><br><br>
Spitfire silenced completely as SubZero took another heavy look at the announcement, noticing a small written note from the innkeeper...
<br><br><br>
."One vote next time, please?"
<br><br><br>
Spitfire snorted at this and SubZero chuckled.
<br><br><br>
."Somehow, I saw that coming." he turned and began to plan out a way to prepare for this theme. At least it didn't involve any battles...
<br><br><br>
A sudden voice could be heard from somewhere and SubZero looked around in search of it, but couldn't.
</p><p>Spitfire began to fly around aimlessly, before finally landing in front of him and something could be seen on one of his wings...A device used for communication.
<br><br><br>
."Where'd this come from..?" SubZero began to ask, but a sudden hologram popped up and the familiar face of the BattleBots weaponsmaster showed up, startling him.
<br><br><br>
."U-Ultimo Destructo?? What are you--" he began to ask, but was cut off.
<br><br><br>
."I don't have much time, SubZero...But I heard about you and this strange world, so I gave this to Spitfire in case something came up. Of course, something did."
<br><br><br>
The panicked tone told SubZero that something dangerous was happening, but he didn't know what...
<br><br><br>
."Remember that strange soldier who came into your kingdom?" Ultimo could be seen being pushed aside and tried to keep control over whatever was causing this, "Well, he's back...In a sense. And somehow he's taken the forms of not only Tombstone - again - but also...Witch Doctor!"
<br><br><br>
SubZero jumped at this. In their realm, Witch Doctor and Tombstone were seen as a dynamic duo, but no one knows why. Bots always mentioned Witch Doctor always being around for Tombstone's matches, and that she idolized him, but the two are never really seen together.
</p><p>But the fact that the two were now combined with the already impressive powers of <i>him</i>...That's not good.
<br><br><br>
."What's going on? What's he doing?"
<br><br><br>
Ultimo began to reply, but a powerful shove sent him out of view and another Bot was there instead.
<br><br><br>
."SubZero!" the orange Bot waved one of his hands excitedly, "Do you see me?"
<br><br><br>
."Tantrum?!" SubZero had no idea what was going on; Ultimo was always alone, even while seeing his family, and they were clearly at his place. Why was Tantrum there?
<br><br><br>
Another Bot popped up beside Tantrum, but only the top of his head could be seen. Yet he knew who this was.
<br><br><br>
."And Blip?!" SubZero knew he had to get Ultimo back on the line. This was not normal behavior...
<br><br><br>
."HEY! Get away from there!"
<br><br><br>
Ultimo's voice could be heard before the two kids rolled away, giggling, and he came back into view.
<br><br><br>
."I know...I never let anyone else in." Ultimo saw SubZero about to speak and sighed, "It's because of the threat why these brats are here! For some reason, they thought I'd be the prefect guardian for them..."
<br><br><br>
A loud "hey!" from Tantrum can be heard from offscreen, before a quick charge slammed Ultimo against the screen. Ultimo sighed and backed away before glancing back and giving his blade a quick spin, to which more giggles could be heard in response.
<br><br><br>
."Anyway, I think he had the idea of returning since you left. He's a lot stronger now and bringing back fallen Bots from the grave! A lot of them were around before you and I, and it's--"
<br><br><br>
."He's in this world too." SubZero spoke as another attack from behind stopped Ultimo short, "He and I are staying at the same place! Yet, I...Hadn't heard a thing from him, and we're...Next...Door."
<br><br><br>
As he said this, SubZero quickly raced out of his room and noticed thick shadows leaking out from under the door leading into  Xac's room. Despite this, he opened the door quickly and noticed that the room was pitch black...
</p><p><i>...Except for a few glowing red lights in the room's center.</i>
<br><br><br>
SubZero stared closely at these lights, his vision slowly closing in on a dark figure that looked similar to Xac...
</p><p>...Yet, it wasn't.
<br><br><br>
Suddenly, two red eyes shot open and SubZero could barely react before a clawed hand swung toward him, nearly striking him before the he could shut the door. An earsplitting screech sounded as the claws apparently struck the door, and SubZero retreated back to his room and froze the area around the entrance, hoping the creature didn't follow.
<br><br><br>
He waited a few moments, ensuring the creature was nowhere nearby, then went back to Spitfire, of whom still had Ultimo on the line.
<br><br><br>
."Is he..?" Ultimo began, but the look on SubZero's face said it all.
<br><br><br>
SubZero took a deep breath, then managed to speak.
<br><br><br>
."He may able to be in two places at once. But what I saw...Couldn't be..."
<br><br><br>
Ultimo gazed at him, before something sounded outside, and the hologram began to form into static. What he said could barely be heard, but this was all SubZero needed to hear:
<br><br><br>
."You have to stop him. This power called Mecha-Necromancy...It must be stopped! But please...Don't harm the ones he brought back."
<br><br><br>
The hologram faded and SubZero stared at the device, before looking at Spitfire. Spitfire stared back at him...And nodded.
<br><br><br>
."This 'Magic' theme is crazier than I thought."
<br><br><br>
The room suddenly filled with a cloud of snow that swirled around like a vortex, soon shrouding everything, and the light sounds of moving metal could be heard.
<br><br><br>
."Spitfire! Join me!"
<br><br><br>
Spitfire hovered immediately at the command, then dove into the top of the vortex, of which then had blasts of flames mixed in with the snow.
<br><br><br>
."My Ultimate Form...Rises again!!"
<br><br><br>
A powerful rumble, and the room is suddenly nothing...Nothing...
</p><p>...But white.
<br><br><br><i>The battle of Light and Dark rages again...</i>
</p><p><i>...And only one can come on top.</i>
<br><br><br><b>CONTEST: How-To's</b>
<br><br><br>
More time has passed, and Xac is busy learning more about Neopia. He has practiced morphing into a more suitable form and finally mastered it.
</p><p>Despite his being comfortable in Ruki Form, he still preferred to be himself. He didn't know how these creatures could stay that way their whole lives!
<br><br><br><i>Lord Xero would be pleased with my progress.</i>
<br><br><br>
He smiled with content and prepared to power off the screen, but a notification popped up, and he figured it was from the innkeeper.
</p><p>He tapped the notification and read it multiple times, pondering on how he could take part.
<br><br><br>
."A creative tutorial..."
<br><br><br>
He stood up and paced around his room, tapping his claws together.
<br><br><br>
."My Lord did tell me I was great with creating weapons. But this world...They're probably unaware of what I can do. So I shall go with this!"
<br><br><br>
Xac opened a slot in his armor and pressed a button, before a giant blackboard appeared on one side of his room, along with a few pieces of chalk.
<br><br><br>
He had no idea why he didn't just use his claws, but Xac began to write down his idea, eager at first, but slowly growing more tense as time passed.
<br><br><br>
."Forget him." He muttered as he continued to write, "Just...Forget...Him..."
<br><br><br>
Xac reached the third step, and came to a halt. For some reason, his planning abilities were failing.
<br><br><br>
."Why..? Why do I...Feel...So..."
<br><br><br>
The room suddenly grew dark, and Xac recognized this sensation. This was who granted him the temporary form that has yet to be used...
<br><br><br>
."Heh, heh...How pathetic." A dark voice spoke, "This is your great plan? You won't get anywhere with such a weak attempt!"
<br><br><br>
Xac barely had the time to react before the familiar sounds of claws on a blackboard filled the air and he knew that his work was being "altered" by this being.
<br><br><br>
."The drawing you did of me...I admit, you captured me perfectly." The voice spoke, "You must think more highly of me than it seems."
<br><br><br>
Xac growled in reply and prepared to speak, but the voice cut in.
<br><br><br>
."Ah, <i>much</i> better!"
<br><br><br>
A small, red flame lit up the room and Xac turned toward the board...
<br><br><br>
And hated what he saw.
<br><br><br>
While his steps were in tact, the third one had claw marks streaking through it, and under those marks, an insult.
<br><br><br>
."YOU--" he began to shout, but was again interrupted.
<br><br><br>
."Keep going!" A shadowy claw could be seen pointing at the board, along with a pair of bright, red eyes as the voice urged him eagerly.
<br><br><br>
Despite his hatred toward the needless edits, Xac continued and finally read the last step...
<br><br><br>
."An army...?" He muttered before chuckling softly, "That isn't a creative step, you idiot!"
<br><br><br>
At this, a dark figure lunged at Xac and shoved him against the wall with a hand pressed against his neck.
<br><br><br>
."It says 'Create an army', so therefore it IS." The figure snarled, "Besides, coming up with more creatures helps with designing in the process...Surely, <i>you</i> of all people know that!"
<br><br><br>
While the first part was just a bunch of baloney, Xac had to admit that the figure made a point; The more creatures made, the more ideas that come flowing in...Just like his weapons, where a double bladed sword can soon evolve into sword claws and even bladed armor.
<br><br><br>
The figure saw his change in emotion and released him, smirking victoriously.
<br><br><br>
."Glad I could be of service...Again."
<br><br><br>
Xac shook his head at the arrogant tone and went back to the board, then took a piece of chalk and wrote something next to the final step, in which had a drawing done of the one who edited it along with the "text" made out of claw marks.
<br><br><br>
."Horrible self portrait."
<br><br><br>
He turned around and grinned proudly, and the figure let out a loud yell before swatting away the chalk and crushing it on the floor.
<br><br><br>
."SHUT UP!"
<br><br><br>
Before anything else could be done, the darkness suddenly faded, and the figure along with it, much to Xac's relief.
<br><br><br>
However, more scratches appeared on the board, spelling out exactly was just shouted before the figure's leave.
<br><br><br>
Xac sighed and shook his head, then placed the board outside his room. He didn't know where contest entries went, and quite frankly, he didn't care.
</p><p>He didn't expect to do well after all that nonsense either, but if anyone could take his advice and actually use it right, that's all he wanted.
<br><br><br><i>After all, he <b>was</b> the expert...</i>
</p><p><i>No matter what that idiot, Dark Xac, claimed.</i>
<br><br><br>
Yet, from his realm of darkness, Dark Xac watched him eagerly, before shifting into another form and chuckling evilly...
<br><br><br><b>BC Theme: Magic - Results</b>
<br><br><br>
The battle between light and dark has subsided, the lands are in ruin, and the darkness fades as SubZero remains triumphant.
</p><p>The world of BattleBots has been saved...For now. But everyone knew that this fierce dark warrior would return.
<br><br><br>
SubZero watches intently as the darkness soon vanishes completely, along with Xac, before changing back to normal.
</p><p>Many BattleBots who were brought back to life remained in shambles, but with what remained of his light magic, SubZero lead them back to their resting places to sleep in peace once more.
</p><p>Bad Kitty was the last to return, and gave SubZero a meow of gratitude before returning to their grave. SubZero watched as the Bots were all buried underground, before turning toward the rest of the kingdom.
<br><br><br>."It's always him." he muttered, checking out the damage, "Yet, where's..."
<br><br><br>
Before he could finish, Tantrum came out from a few buildings away and called to him, seemingly frantic.
<br><br><br>."SubZero!" he waved SubZero over as quickly as he could, "Tombstone's back! But...Something's wrong."
<br><br><br>
SubZero wondered if it was due to the dark energy and raced over to where Tombstone remained, noticing him laying in a weakened heap and barely able to move.
<br><br><br>
Tantrum rolled beside him, his gaze filled with concern despite his usual hatred toward the veteran Bot. It wasn't like Tombstone to appear this weak, or even defeated. He almost seemed scared...
</p><p>Tombstone began to speak, his voice low and obviously filled with terror. What he said startled SubZero and Tantrum.
<br><br><br>."Shadow...Demon."
<br><br><br>
Tantrum looked at SubZero at this, and even SubZero didn't quite understand what was just said.
</p><p>Then he remembered the creature he saw at the inn.
</p><p>That pitch black shadow...
<br><br><br>."Could that had been..?"
</p><p>SubZero looked down at the weakened Tombstone and noticed jagged claw marks ripping through his armor, sparking with red energy.
</p><p>Another shout fills the air, this time from Ultimo Destructo, and SubZero raced over toward the voice with Tantrum following behind.
<br><br><br>."Witch Doctor!"
<br><br><br>
Witch Doctor, too, laid on the ground, barely moving, and even she seemed shook up about something...Most likely...
<br><br><br>."Dark...Being...Demigod."
<br><br><br>
SubZero knew she was talking about the same creature as Tombstone and glanced at Ultimo.
<br><br><br>."Will you be able to help them? I have to head back to the inn as soon as possible. I have to..."
<br><br><br>
A nod from Ultimo stopped him short and he answered, "I'll see what I can do to get some information on this being as well. It's not like either of them to be seen in this shape. Even with his ongoing losses, Tombstone's never been this badly injured."
<br><br><br>
SubZero gave him a reassuring glance, then bid Ultimo and Tantrum farewell, before leaving the kingdom and heading back to the inn, unaware of what awaited him there...
<br><br><br>
|||
<br><br><br>
SubZero returns to the inn and immedately heads to his room. However, he hears loud yelling from nearby.
</p><p>That yelling...Was coming from Xac's room.
<br><br><br>."I'm not dealing with that."
<br><br><br>
SubZero entered his room, and Spitfire flew from behind him, glad to be back in their room.
</p><p>An object glistens beside the throne and the two go up to it. Spitfire let out a small chirp and perched on a gold trophy, of which nearly fell on top of him.
<br><br><br>."What's this?" SubZero studied the trophy, wondering where it came from, then heard someone announce, "The results of the 9/30 contest is over! Here are the winners!", along with the many names of contestants who were in that week.
<br><br><br>."In 6th overall: SUBZERO from the Shoyru category!"
<br><br><br>
Spitfire flew into the air, seemingly knowing what they meant by "overall": SubZero placed 6th out of EVERY CONTESTANT that week. He perched on SubZero's head and let out a triumphant roar.
</p><p>Moments later, another familiar name was heard:
<br><br><br>."In 9th overall: XAC from the Ruki category!"
<br><br><br>
The entire inn shook at this and SubZero knew that something wasn't right. Xac clearly won his category, but...
<br><br><br>
Spitfire flew back to the trophy and perched inside, then motioned for SubZero to return to his rightful place.
</p><p>Despite the fear toward what could be happening to Xac, SubZero sighed and rolled back to the throne.
<br><br><br>."Dark being...Shadow demon...Demigod."
<br><br><br>
He reflected on those titles for a moment, then started to grow drowsy. That fight really used up a lot of energy...
<br><br><br><i>The fight was won...But the war's far from over...</i>
<br><br><br>
|||
<br><br><br>
Xac stands in the middle of his room, shaking as a shady figure yells at him. He backs against the wall, his gaze fixed ahead, and flinches as the figure continues to insult him.
<br><br><br>."FOOL! IDIOT! WEAKLING!" the figure's voice is loud and booming as it draws nearer, "All that power I gave you...And you couldn't even WIN A SIMPLE FIGHT??"
<br><br><br>
Xac glances down at the figure's hand, of which had another gold trophy in its grasp, before it swung at him, nearly striking his face.
<br><br><br>."I've lost against him before! How'd you expect me to win now? I had this SAME power then and it failed me again!"
<br><br><br>
The figure halted at this, before lunging with its loose hand and nearly grabbing Xac's neck, but instead struck the wall.
<br><br><br>."Why do I even bother trusting you?" it growled, "This power...It was limited not only to yourself, but to ME! Because of you, <i>I no longer have it</i>!"
<br><br><br>
Xac dodged another swift swing and tried to reply, but this being wasn't going to listen to anything he had to say.
</p><p>He then looked back down at the trophy and saw a glimpse of himself in its golden hues. For some reason, he began to remember Xero and how he's hoping to conquer this world to make him proud. He worked hard, and honestly...
</p><p><i>He didn't really want that power. It was forced upon him.</i>
<br><br><br>
The shadow apparently knew what he was thinking and gripped the trophy tight, allowing thick shadows to cover it before it began to melt. Red sparks coursed throughout the shadows before pieces of the trophy fell onto the floor, the gold corrupted by black stains.
<br><br><br>.".<i>This</i> means nothing to me." it spoke, releasing its grip on the remains, "What I seek...Cannot be obtained in this world. I still require what I need from your precious lord. However, as long as you're stuck here, I'm unable to make any sort of attempt to achieve it."
<br><br><br>
Xac glanced up at the shadow, then back down at the shadows that stained the floor, before replying.
<br><br><br>."Then you're lucky you don't have to face him."
<br><br><br>
The being surrounded Xac with its body, then smirked as it also replied.
<br><br><br>."Unfortunately for <i>you</i>, you're <i>stuck</i> with me."
<br><br><br>
Xac didn't speak after this. It did have a point...And to make things worse, it was also his dark half. This being was the one and only <i>Dark Xac</i>, but his true name?
<br><br><br><i>The Temptlord.</i>
<br><br><br>
A demigod bent on emotions, but turned inner demon after a challenge Xac took to earn his promotion. While the fight was tough, the aftermath was even moreso.
</p><p>Xac knew he had to be alert at all times, for his inner demon could strike at any moment, especially when his emotions willed it.
</p><p>His lord called this a "lifelong test", and he was right. Dark Xac could give him strength at one moment and bring him down the next. He was unpredictable, and also very ruthless.
<br><br><br><i>He just couldn't win.</i>
<br><br><br>
Xac sighed as his inner demon finally let him go, and went over to his bed. <i>Perhaps it was better that SubZero won that fight after all.</i>
<br><br><br>."It wasn't. But I'm not done yet."
<br><br><br>
Dark Xac spoke, his back facing his host and his gaze fixed on the screen that flickered with the rest of the contest results.
<br><br><br>."I have other ways to bring him down. And whether or not you help me, it doesn't matter. I'll do what I must to crush not only him, but this world...And your precious lord as well!"
<br><br><br>
Before Xac could speak up, the shadowy demon vanished, and the last thing he heard were these threatening words:
<br><br><br>."Enjoy your time while you still can. I'll be back...With a new power. And then, everyone will cower before me!"
<br><br><br><b>Drastic Changes</b>
<br><br><br>
It's been a while since the last event, and suddenly, the inn was no more.
</p><p>Instead, Xac and SubZero are living in what appeared to be a cabin, of which had magical powers to change into what was in their world.
<br><br><br>
SubZero's frozen room from the inn remained, and the same could be said about Xac's metallic room, filled with technology.
<br><br><br>
However, the innkeeper was gone, and instead, a Hissi was the one managing everything. Xac and SubZero knew the Hissi from when they first appeared in this world, and even from the world beyond, and they had no problem engaging with them in conversation.
<br><br><br>
Apparently, the innkeeper had quit her job and left the Hissi in charge. But since no one else was actively engaging in activity, the Hissi was left to work alone, with any resources they could find.
<br><br><br>
Xac and SubZero knew something had to be done. Xac still had his mission; He had to do more research and inform of them to his lord. SubZero had no idea how to return. He could easily use his hidden form to fly back, sure, but since he had no idea how he arrived to this day, he wasn't sure if he'd be able to make it back - much less in one piece.
<br><br><br>
Using his military status, Xac was able to search the realm, and eventually found someone to help with services. He was known as a Scorchio, and was actually applying to become the mascot of Cosmos before the inn came to be.
</p><p>The Scorchio wasn't chosen, however, and went back into space, running his own cafe, but felt no grudge toward the Grundo who took his position. He still yearned to help out somehow, and when Xac offered him a position to run a shop, he quickly accepted.
<br><br><br>
The Scorchio - who was introduced as Cosmokin - was accepted to run the shop, considering that the profits went to projects amongst the inhabitents of Cosmos. He gave his solemn promise to not let them down, and quickly proved his worth by selling various sources to others. He was already becoming known as a brilliant salesman and continues to support his fellow citizens with pride.
<br><br><br>
Due to their hard work, Xac and SubZero were promoted to Ambassadors of Cosmos, and Xac enjoys boasting to his lord about how he helps run the place with a commanding presense, but still hasn't forgotten what he must do.
</p><p><i>Conquer the world...And claim it in Lord Xero's name.</i>
<br><br><br>
SubZero connected with Cosmokin in a near immediate fashion - possibly due to his hidden form and comrade being dragons. He enjoys helping the Scorchio create chilled drinks and helping him freeze - as well as heat - anything requested.
</p><p>SubZero has a hidden fondness for food, and is joked about "making pancakes", but in reality, he really can flip an awesome pancake...And not all of them are enemy Bots.
</p><p>Spitfire has also proven himself helpful, helping Cosmokin heat up and boil water when the time is running low. He enjoys helping out, and while his flames are rather limited, is given time to rest and recharge between sessions. His favorite things to assist with are baking and helping with hot drinks; From hot chocolate, to tea, to coffee, Spitfire is there to help with them all.
<br><br><br>
The new world is now surrounded in a dome that surpasses space and time, and while sometimes, the whereabouts of the innkeeper are questioned, it seems that people still enjoy their time in Cosmos, and hope that despite their former leader's leave, that they will continue to grow and thrive.
<br><br><br>
And with the continuous efforts of not only the Hissi, but also SubZero, Xac, and Cosmokin, the rates seem quite high that Cosmos will continue to live, even through the toughest of times.

<b>Roleplay Workshop:</b>
<p><i>My lame attempts at RP intros. I don't roleplay, but can do interactions not involving characters engaging in combat. Xac would win, trust me.</i>
<br><br><br>
Xac wandered around outside the inn, his scanners quickly picking up on everything. </p><p>From the scenery to the scents and sounds...He memorized all of them.
<br><br><br>
He heaved a heavy sigh and glanced down at his claws, noticing right away that they needed sharpening. Of course, he hasn't been in battle for a while now -- Not since entering THIS place.
<br><br><br>
He thought about using SubZero, but no...He'd just try to flip him into space again, if not use his ice powers against him.
<br><br><br>
Xac looked around again, making sure there wasn't anything that could do his claws justice, then sighed again and went inside the inn and toward his room.
<br><br><br>
He entered his room and went up to one of the walls, remembering how the room was somehow set to appear like his home...Meaning he had metal walls.
<br><br><br>
."The garbage will do."
<br><br><br>
And with that, Xac dug his claws into the wall and sharpened his claws the best he could...
</p><p>
...Surprisingly, the "garbage" did a wonderful job.
<br><br><br>
Xac took the time after to try appearing more like these creatures. While he was given a temporary form, it wasn't until a later event when he could use it.
</p><p>
He had the basic design memorized, and focused on turning into it. <i>Surely it's not THAT hard to become such a miserable insect..!</i>
<br><br><br>
He could feel it...
</p><p>
The transformation was happening.
<br><br><br>
His body remained basically the same, encased in his unbreakable armor, however, his scorpion tail broke out and his appearance became slightly more insectoid.
</p><p>
Two long antennae popped out of his head, and his largest "teeth" curved slightly to replicate an insects mouth.
</p><p>
Despite the species usually standing on four legs, Xac remained on two. He preferred it that way, however, and gazed at himself, seemingly admiring his success.
<br><br><br>
."Transformation was a success. Ruki Form complete."
<br><br><br>
He had to admit, he was rather impressed with the transformation. He was still 6"10, and very intimidating with his glowing eyes and sharp claws...He just had to get used to looking like a bug.
<br><br><br><i>This task would be a cinch for the head leader of the Dark Lord's army.</i>
<br><br><br>
Xac sent more information toward his home World, where he knew his lord was waiting for anything he could get, then headed out and toward the dining room.
<br><br><br>
Xac reached the room's entrance and saw the innkeeper (who he'd already scanned before and found was a Cybunny), along with another creature he'd never seen before.
<br><br><br>
."Another subject..?"
<br><br><br>
Xac scanned the creature, only noting her species:
<br><br><br>
."Aisha."
<br><br><br><br>
✧✧✧
<br><br><br><br><font size="4">Encounters:</font>
</p><p><i>If you want to give an encounter a go, please let me know~ I have SubZero and Xac to choose from and both have very different personalities.</i> <b>ALL encounters will be posted on this page unless otherwise stated, so please be aware of that. I will edit formatting when needed, but otherwise, things such as spelling will remain the same unless it's too hard to read.</b>
<br><br><br>

<br><br><br><b>The Commander and the Innkeeper</b>
</p><p><i>Featuring Raven's Loccia</i>
</p>
<br><br><br>
Loccia had seen her share of travelers from far away lands- all accross Neopia. However, she slightly raised an eyebrow to the notion that something was different about the Ruki who just entered the room. <br>Loccia could not put her finger on it so she decided to brush it off. What type of trouble could a Ruki get into, anyway? <p>But in these remote woods, there was no telling who you might run into.
<br><br><br>
Xac noticed the look he was given and turned back toward the Cybunny, lifting one hand and flicking the air with a claw, of which glistened in the light.
<br><br><br>
."Is there something wrong..?" His voice was calm, yet slightly dark, and he leaned against the wall with one hand holding him up, "You seemed...Nervous for a moment."
<br><br><br>
He twitched his tail slightly as he said this, and he realized he was able to control it almost better as a Ruki than as his true self.
</p><p><i>Very strange...</i>
<br><br><br>
Loccia winced slightly, at being noticed in her moment of doubt, "Me? Oh I'm not nervous," she smiled as gently as she could, despite being well... nervous. 
</p><p>."Don't worry about it, can I get you something to drink?" she handed the Ruki a menu:
</p><p>
."Carrot Juice
</p><p>Ginger Ale
</p><p>Apple Cider
</p><p>Sparkling Water
</p><p>
Today's Special:
<br>Plum and Pomegrante with a Lemon Wedge"
<br><br><br>
Despite his scanners picking up on the nervousness, Xac went up and gazed at the drinks.
<br><br><br>
They...Were not up to his standards.
<br><br><br>
."Hm...Not bad if you're made of flesh and bone. But not for someone like me." He tapped one hand's claws together and a slight smirk appeared on his face, "Do you have something for...Mechanical beings, perhaps..?".
<br><br><br>
Locachia kept her cool. She was starting to pick up on something about this Neopet... But still unsure what that was, exactly.
</p><p>."Mechanical?" She whispered. There was a can of oil out back... What was she thinking, it couldn't be.
</p><p>."Excuse me for asking sir, are you a robot?" Not entirely unfamiliar with robotkin.
<br><br><br>
Xac could barely believe what he just heard. Did someone really just ask about his kind?
<br><br><br>
Somehow, he found it amusing, and he couldn't help but chuckle before replying.
<br><br><br>
."I am known as a Battle Mech. I can live on battles and tactics alone, but a plate of meat can also hit the spot." He glanced at his claws, admiring their sharpness, before answering, "But yes...In simple terms: I am a robot."
<br><br><br><i>He couldn't believe he just had to say that...</i>
<br><br><br>
But what he said next may had been even more startling:
<br><br><br>
."However, I don't live off the same as mortal machines. I live on...Shall we say...<i>Dark energy</i>..?"
<br><br><br>
After he finished, he slid his hands together, scraping his claws against each other, and grinned.
<br><br><br>
."Do tell me...Is there such a source in this world? Heh...I'm rather new here."
<br><br><br>
Another chuckle leaves his mouth, and he taps his claws together as he awaited a response.

</p><p></p><div align="center" style="background-color: #602020; overflow: auto; height: 800; width: 800; border: 0px solid #000000;"><b>Being redone!</b>
<br><p><b>Name:</b> Lysandre
<br><b>Alias:</b> Lys, "Hey You" (by Beel and Levi), "The Watch Dog" (by everyone but Iablo), Mister Serious (by his brother)
<br><b>Race:</b> Demon
<br><b>Likes:</b> His family, hot tea, cooking, getting compliments on his meals, classy gatherings, dancing, fancy outfits, cleanliness
<br><b>Dislikes:</b> Beel and Levi making noise, being rushed, getting dirty, dust, being pranked, Scarsandre slacking off
</p><p><b>History:</b>
<br>I was a part of the Royal Demon family before the Young Master was even born. I served the King and Queen of Demonius for centuries, and made sure everything they wanted was achieved. However, chaos broke out between the realms of demons and vampires, and the King and Queen had to do battle. At this time, Young Lord Iablo was a mere infant, and I was ordered to protect him at all costs.
</p><p>Eventually, our realm was invaded by vampires, and I had to hide the Young Master so they couldn't find him. I then stayed with him and kept him safe.
</p><p>The battle finally ended and the King and Queen returned. They had won the fight, and the vampires had fled...For now. They could tell that there would soon be another battle, and got everyone in Demonius to work on preparations.
</p><p>When Lord Iablo was two years old, he had a baby brother, Lord Levi. The two were inseperable, even though Iablo showed dominance over his brother. Such was to be expected, since he was to become the new King of Demonius, and his father had been teaching him ever since he said his first word. I eventually noticed that Lord Levi had his own set of quirks; He really loved water and anything cold. If he didn't get ice cream or a (very rare) snow cone, he would cry until we gave in. He also found himself trying to sing, even though he didn't know how to talk. Music fascinated him, and he loved seeing the neon lights and the many instruments. Apparently he learned how to walk while watching a concert under my supervision. Needless to say I had to give the good news to his parents, and they found it amusing.
</p><p>When Lord Iablo was three and Lord Levi just turned one, news came that we had another child in the family, another boy: Master Beel. I could sense that he was going to be a hassle from the start, and I was right. Beel would eat and chew on anything, be it a spoon or even his own hand. Feeding him took what seemed to be hours because he always wanted more, and he didn't turn anything down...Except cold food. Thankfully we had Lord Levi to take care of such matters.
<br>Beel didn't take very long to learn how to crawl, especially since anything that seemed edible seemed to have encouraged him, and he was walking before he reached a year old. However, he didn't talk until he was about a year old, or almost two. Most of the time, he made noises to communicate, and while it seemed cute at first, it got to become a huge concern. When he finally said his first word, it was a surprise to us all...But the word he said wasn't a huge surprise: Food.
</p><p>Eventually, Lord Iablo had to be taken off to learn more about how to rule the realm peacefully, and was able to have some independance. He was strangely mature for his age. I still kept an eye on him to make sure he didn't wander too far, and saw the strangest sight: He was talking to a <i>vampire.</i>
<br>Apparently, this vampire was the future King of Vampirion: Maximillion Vamp, and he was learning the ways of ruling his own realm, just like Lord Iablo. The two seemed to get along, but to Lord Iablo's parents, Maximillion was a threat and he was to never communicate with him again.
</p><p>When Lord Iablo was ten, another invasion occurred, and I was once again supposed to protect the King and Queen's children. The vampires were stronger than before, and I had to do more than ever to ensure the brothers' safety. I had to fight back.
<br>Many vampires tried to swarm the castle, eventually breaking down every entrance and invading, and I knew I was outnumbered. But I had to protect Lord Iablo and his brothers at all costs.
<br>I began to strike at them, and before I knew it, was knocked aside by an elite soldier of the vampiric army. But right when that happened, Lord Iablo fought the vampires and caused them to flee. If it weren't for him, they would've destroyed me...And I owed my life to him.
</p><p>Finally, everything died down and I awaited the King and Queen's return. They never came back. Lord Iablo knew right away that they were defeated in battle, and I could sense his anger. He wanted to get revenge for his parents, but I knew it would only bring more harm than good.
<br>Lord Iablo was about to give the order to prepare for an invasion of his own, but a familiar someone flew in. That someone...Was Lord Maximillion, the new King of Vampires. He said that he didn't want our realms to clash anymore, much to our surprise. He wanted our realms to forgive each other for all that's been done in the past, and to now live in peace. Lord Iablo could tell that his intentions were pure and agreed to the truce, soon becoming the new King of Demonius afterwards.
</p><p>Ever since that day, I've remained to be by our King's side, and will never forget how he defended me during that dreaded fight. I will never betray the family that took me in, and I am proud to have been here for the past 50,000 years.
