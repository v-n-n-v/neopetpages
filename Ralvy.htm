<center><table class="bd"><tr><td><b>NOTE: recommendations in this guide are for challengers fought on EASY (green) difficulty.</b></td></tr></table></center>
<p>
<b>So let's begin. Here's what you'll need:</b>
<br></p><center><table class="bc"><tr><td>A pet with at least 11 HP</td><td>
The level 1 Faerie Ability<br>Static Cling*<br>(<a href="//www.neopets.com/dome/abilities.phtml">train it here</a>)</td><td>

<p>(* your level 1 faerie ability is free, but you'll need to trade in weak bottled faeries for all higher level abilities)<br><br>
The first opponent you're going to take on is the Chia Clown in the Central Area. <br><b>Note:</b> Do not bother with Mr. Chuckles; he has the same HP but much stronger weapons and no added benefit/rewards. 
<br><br><b>The important information is this:</b>
<br>Chia Clown has 10 HP. The absolute maximum amount of damage he can do to you in a single turn is 10. 
<br>
He does have an item that can fully block your damage for 1 turn, which is why you should have the healing potion equipped just in case. 
<br><br><b>Otherwise, select the following items for turn 1:</b>
<br>x2 Ring of the Sway
<br>Use your Static ability 
<br><br>
...and blast him! Even if you have a pet with the lowest possible strength stat, this will 1 hit KO assuming he doesn't use the full block item. 
<br><br>
If he DOES use the full block item and damages you, on turn 2 use:
<br>x1 Ring of the Sway
<br>Magical Healing Potion 
<br>Use your Static ability 
<br><br>
And proceed from there. 
<br><br><b>Congrats on your spoils! </b>
<br>All battledome opponents, regardless of difficulty or where they are fought, can award codestones (both normal and red). Because the Chia Clown is in the Central Arena, he has some additional items exclusive to that location. Most aren't worth much. However, keep an eye out for the Chocolate Ice Cream item. This item has a higher value (usually around 35,000 np at the time of writing) because it is part of a Cooking Pot recipe to create a valuable negg. <br><br>Also save any <b>weak bottled faeries</b> you get, as you can use these to train higher level faerie abilities in the future.</p>

<table class="bd"><tr><td><b>QUICK TIP: Healing after fights</b></td></tr><tr><td> If you don't want to spend additional NP on healing items, you can heal in the battledome itself. Here's how:<br>
-Make sure you have your Magical Healing Potion equipt.
<br>-Fight Punchingbab Bob, but only use your healing item. 
<br>-Withdraw from the fight. Your HP will be restored up to the amount of your healer and you will not take damage. 
<br>-Repeat as needed depending on your max HP stat.<br>-Withdrawing counts as a loss. </td></tr></table><h1><a name="defender">S750 Kreludan Defender Robot:</a></h1><p>

Ok, so you're able to fight the Chia Clown. What next? 
Let's move on to the S750 Kreludan Defender Robot in the Neocola Centre. 
<br><br><b>Here's what you'll need:</b>
<br></p><center><table class="bc"><tr><td>A pet with at least <br>25 HP &amp;<br> 13 Strength.</td><td>
The level 1 Faerie Ability<br>Static Cling<br>(<a href="//www.neopets.com/dome/abilities.phtml">train it here</a>)</td><td>

<p>
And with that, it's time for a quick explanation about how stats and damage work. 
<br><br>
In the battledome, weapons have an "icon" value. This roughly equates to how much damage they can do. 
<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SjiR65J.png"><br><br>
In the example above, the weapon is doing 9 icons of damage. Those icons have an elemental type, but we'll skip that for now since it's not important yet. 
<br><br>
What is important is your strength stat. The amount of damage a weapon can do scales with your strength stat. At very low strength numbers, it scales DOWN, meaning you do less damage than the number of icons the weapon has. Here's an example:
<br><br>
Your strength stat is 6 and you use a weapon that does 10 icons of damage. Due to the low strength stat, the weapon only does 5 damage instead of 10 (aka half damage).
<br><br><b>Here's what you need to know:</b> in order for every 1 icon a weapon has to do 1 damage, your pet's strength stat needs to be <b>at least 13</b>.
<br><br>
S750 has 14 HP and the maximum amount of damage it can do to you in a single turn is 24. It also has a weapon with a 50% chance to freeze you.
<br><br><b>So where to start? First, training:</b>
<br>If your pet DOES NOT already have 13 points in strength, start there. 
Train your pet up to level 7. Then train strength to 13. If you train in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/pirates/academy.phtml">pirate academy</a>, this will only cost a One Dubloon Coin per training session and is the cheapest option. 
<br><br>
Next, train HP (called "endurance" in the schools). To continue only paying 1 dubloon per session, keep your level at or below 10 until you reach 20 HP. 
<br>Once you hit 20 HP, you will need to train level again to proceed. Train your level up to 13 and finish off your HP to 25. 
<br><br><b>Now, let's fight. Select the following items for turn 1:</b>
<br>x2 Ring of the Sway
<br>Use your Static ability 

<br><br>At 13 strength, you should be doing 25 damage to it. More than enough to 1-shot. If it freezes you for a turn, use your healer and keep fighting until you KO.
<br><br>
Easy-peasy. In addition to the usual codestones, the Neocola Centre can award Neocola Tokens, Genius Neggs, and the very valuable Armoured Negg.</p>

<h1><a name="koi">The Koi Warrior:</a></h1><p>

Next, you're at a bit of a crossroads. For low level battlers, the most profitable arena is probably still the Neocola Centre. However, many choose to move on to the Dome of the Deep to fight the Koi Warrior. 
<br><br>
The Dome of the Deep awards dubloons (1, 2, 5, and 10), which are generally less valuable than Neocola tokens, but you win them more frequently and if you want to continue training your pet they are very handy to have. So let's move forward with fighting the Koi Warrior. 
<br><br><b>Here's what you'll need:</b>
<br></p><center><table class="bc"><tr><td>A pet with at least <br>53 HP &amp;<br> 55 Strength.</td><td>
The level 1 Faerie Ability<br>Icicle<br>(<a href="//www.neopets.com/dome/abilities.phtml">train it here</a>)</td><td>
x2 Turned Tooth<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/wea_tooth.gif"></td><td>
x1 Blue Scorchstone <br>(OR Cursed Elixir of Neovia)<br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/new_dragonstone_6.gif"></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
Koi Warrior has 65 HP and the maximum amount of damage he can do to you in a single turn is 52. He also has a faerie ability that can freeze you for one turn.
<br><br>
That's a BIG HP jump. His Strength stat is also higher and he does more damage. Your strength stat needs to be equivalent if you want to take him down in the fewest turns possible. At 55 Strength, each icon of damage you do will deal 2 points of damage. 
<br><br><b>Icon types also become more important here.</b> The Koi Warrior's weapons have the potential to defend against Water, Fire, Physical, and Dark icon types. Because of this, you want to stick to using Air, Earth, or Light icons when you attack him.
<br><br><b>Turned Tooth</b> is your best price per icon value. This weapon does a range of damage between 13 and 22 icons, with most of them being Earth icons. It also does Physical icons, but it does enough of them that you'll more than likely still hit for more damage than he can block.
<br><br><b>So let's fight him. Select the following items for turn 1:</b>
<br>x2 Turned Tooth 
<br>Use your Icicle ability 
<br><br>
If this does NOT KO him, select Turned Tooth again, use your healing item, and use Icicle for turn 2. 
<br><br>
And you've done it! Earn dubloons to your heart's content.
</p>
<h1><a name="jetsam">The Jetsam Ace:</a></h1><p>

But wait, I have <b>Premium</b> and want to fight the Jetsam Ace!
<br><br>
In that case, use the same set as above. 
<br><br>
Jetsam Ace has 53 HP and the maximum amount of damage he can do to you in a single turn is 46. He also has a faerie ability that can freeze you, a multi-use item that can freeze you, and he can heal up to 50%. 
<br><br>
The Jetsam Ace is very similar to the Koi Warrier, other than his extra freeze chances and the heal. That said, he also has lower HP than Koi Warrior, so even with his improved defense options you should be able to defeat him with the Koi set. 
<br><br>
However, don't forget to continue training your stats as you battle to make these fights even easier and more consistent. At the point where you're fighting the Ace or Koi Warrior, it's time to <b>consider leveling to 50 to get Lens Flare</b>. With it, you will always 1 hit KO him without taking damage and can save time/money healing between fights. 
</p><h1><a name="extra">Tell Me More:</a></h1><p>
</p>
<h2>What is Lens Flare and why do I need it?</h2>
Lens Flare is a faerie ability that you can gain starting at level 50. Once per battle you can use it to completely stop your opponent from attacking. 
<br><br>
You do NOT need a level 50 pet or Lens Flare to get into battling. While Lens Flare is a huge help, it is not necessary in the short term or to get started with the weaker opponents. 

If you decide to move on to stronger opponents, having it will save you a lot of trouble and healing. 
<br><br>
Using Lens Flare turn 1 with your two attacking items should completely shut down all the above opponents and KO them with taking minimal or no damage. 

<h2>What are icons and how do weapons work?</h2>
Weapons work based on your pet's stats. You need to look at both your pet and the weapon to get an idea of how damage/defense happens.
<br><br>
Your pet has a strength stat and a defense stat. Weapons have icons that either attack or defend.
<br><br>
Your pet's stats are applied as a multiplier to the icons of a weapon. 

<br><br>
If your pet's strength/defense is between 13-19, the number of icons is multiplied by 1.<br>
If your pet's strength/defense is between 20-34, the number of icons is multiplied by 1.25.<br>
If your pet's strength/defense is between 35-54, the number of icons is multiplied by 1.5.<br><br>

And so forth.Consider this example:
<h3></h3><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0Q9mSpR.png"><h3></h3>
It does 7 icons of damage, and defends 3 icons. 
<br><br> If you have a pet with 13 strength, attacking with this item will do 7 points of damage. If your pet also has 13 defense, they will defend 3 icons of damage. 
<br><br><h2>So what's the deal with the different icon types?</h2>
Weapons can have up to 7 different elemental "types": Air, Water, Fire, Earth, Dark, Light, or Physical.
<br><br>
This is mostly important when considering defense. If you block a specific element, you take less (or no) damage from that element. Let's look at this example again:
<h3></h3><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0Q9mSpR.png"><h3></h3>
Your pet's strength and defense stats are 13, you attack with the Greater Air Potion (which attacks with 7 air icons and defends 3 air icons).
<h3></h3><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cy4z8of.png"><h3></h3>
Your opponent has the same stats and they use Scroll of the Western Winds.
<br><br>
You will deal 4 damage to your opponent (they will block 3).
<br>You will receive no damage (you will block 3). 

<h2>What are the best items to use?</h2>
<table><tr><td><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_tyweof2013_rng_sway.gif">__</td><td><b>***NEW, updated as of Oct 2023**</b> Thanks to the new daily quest system, a great budget option has been added for beginner battlers: <b>Ring of the Sway</b>. This former plot prize deals 11 icons and at the time of adding this, is selling for less than 10 NPs (assuming you haven't already gotten one for free!)</td></tr></table><br><table><tr><td><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bvs_ultranova_scroll.gif">__</td><td><b>Ring of the Sway is now the top pick for price vs power on ultra cheap sets, but I'll keep this up just for reference, as the guide was written with scroll in mind and it can still be used for most of the challengers listed here!</b> When you're just getting started, the best and cheapest weapon you can start with is <b><a href="//www.neopets.com/search.phtml?selected_type=object&amp;string=Scroll+of+Ultranova">Scroll of Ultranova</a></b>. It deals approximately 10 icons and costs only a few hundred NP as of writing this. Buy from user shops for the best price. </td></tr></table><br><table><tr><td><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_burning_birch_twigs.gif">__</td><td>Released at the Advent Calendar in 2022, <b>Bundle of Burning Birch Branches</b> is a good ~13 icon weapon that's great for just getting started. If you picked one of these up for free at the calendar, else are able to get them for cheap, go ahead and use it over Scroll of Ultranova.</td></tr></table><br><table><tr><td><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/wea_tooth.gif">__</td><td>You'll often hear people say <b><a href="//www.neopets.com/search.phtml?selected_type=object&amp;string=Turned+Tooth">Turned Tooth</a></b> is your next best upgrade, and they'd be right. In terms of price for power, it can't be beat. Its only downside is it does a range of damage, between 13 and 22 icons. Sometimes you'll get unlucky with the low end, but more often than not you will at least get a couple of extra icons of damage making it very potent. Prices tend to fluctuate on this item due to its status as a good beginner item, so if you can't afford it just yet, you can always try wishing for it at the <a href="//www.neopets.com/wishing.phtml">Wishing Well</a>.</td></tr></table><br><table><tr><td><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bd_roxtons_lucky_bowie_knife.gif">__</td><td>The Advent Calendar has provided yet another great starter option for new battledomers. <b>Roxtons Trusty Bowie Knife</b> does 15 icons of damage and blocks 75% of all earth icons dealt. This is great for a free weapon (provided you were able to pick one up from the AC). If you already have this, go ahead and use it over Scroll of Ultranova or the Birch Branches. You can also replace a Turned Tooth with this weapon, but price for power on TT is still better overall.</td></tr></table><br><table><tr><td><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bpo_lightning.gif">__</td><td><b>NOTE: In the advent of Roxtons, this item may become less viable for the price. However, as Roxton is still new and a set price hasn't established, I'll be leaving this suggestion up in case of future price hikes.</b> -- Worried about those variable icons? Then <b><a href="//www.neopets.com/search.phtml?selected_type=object&amp;string=Lightning+in+a+Bottle">Lightning in a Bottle</a></b> is the item for you. This weapon's downside is it can only be used once per battle (but doesn't disappear, so you can use it again for your next fight). It's a good idea to have an extra attacking weapon equipped if you choose to use it, just in case your opponent blocks that turn. It's guaranteed to do 15 icons and costs slightly less than the Turned Tooth.</td></tr></table><br><br><b>Healers</b><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/alm_potion_orange.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/new_dragonstone_6.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bpo_neovia_elixir.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/bvs_heal3.gif"><br><br>The <b><a href="//www.neopets.com/search.phtml?selected_type=object&amp;string=Magical+Healing+Potion">Magical Healing Potion</a></b> is the absolute cheapest healing potion you can start with, and heals you for 15 HP. This is perfect for Chia Clown and can help against the Defender bot. When you start getting to stronger oppnents, you need a stronger healer. <b>Blue Scorchstone</b> is a good budget healer that will gain you 30 HP, and <b>Cursed Elixir of Neovia</b> is your slight upgrade to that at 40 HP plus a couple of extra physical damage icons for good measure. If you want to go even higher, consider a <b>Greater Healing Scroll</b> which heals 50 HP or <a href="//www.neopets.com/search.phtml?selected_type=object&amp;string=Helm+of+Recovery">Helm of Recovery</a> (which does the same, choose whatever is cheaper).
<br><br><h2>What about training the defense stat and using defensive items?</h2>

In short: don't worry about them. You should be aiming to take your opponent out as quickly as possible. If you plan on training your battle pet beyond low level fighting, then it's cheaper to train defense alongside the other stats. However, if your goal is only to grind in the lower level areas for profit, don't worry about it. If you change your mind later, you can always go back and train defense (albeit at a higher cost).
