Hello there Honored Visitor, my name is Katsy79, and I am an Acara *giggle*. So what does a gorgeous Acara like moi like to do?<br><br>
Well there is simply tons to do in Neopia.  Sometimes I go swimming with my friends just off the coast of Mystery Island.<br><br>
The best spot to swim is near the <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop"><b>Rock Pool</b></a>. 
Providing that Kougra doesn't spot you you can have hours of fun playing with cute petpets like Catamaras, Ghotis and 
Waleins - all for free!

I am a proud member of the Princess Fernypoo fan club (actually I think I am the only member as I just made it up, but

<b>About Me:</b><p>
</p>
</center>
Well I love playing Cheat!, of course, and there is nothing like a good game of <a href="/gormball.phtml"><b>Gormball</b></a> 
on a hot afternoon.  Most weekends my owner takes me to the seaside and I go diving for treasure.  <b><a href="//www.neopets.com/randomfriend.phtml?randomfriend=chuckie001">chuckie001</a></b> tells me I am
 a really good diver, although I haven't found anything remarkable yet.  I will though, just you wait and see!
<p>
Reading is also something I enjoy doing.  I am trying to read every Acara book there is, so far I know there are 
five, but I always look for new ones whenever I go to the <a href="//www.neopets.com/objects.phtml?type=shop"><b>Book Shop</b></a>, just 
in case a new one comes out. 
</p>
<p>
This summer chuckie001 has promised to take me to the Lost Desert.  Its a very long way from Neopia Central so we are saving up 
our Neopoints for a big shopping splurge when we get there.  I really hope I get to see Senator Barca, she is one of my 
heroes, and I am really glad her name was cleared after the King Coltzan tragedy.

A turtle climbs up a hill during the day but slides back down each night while he sleeps.  If the turtle climbs 5 feet each day but slips back 4 feet each night, how many days will it take him to reach the top?  The hill is 35 feet high.  At the top it is flat, so he won't slip down anymore *once he reaches it*.  (Careful, this one is tricky.)<br>Extra Credit: How many days will it take if he climbs 5 feet a day but slips back only 3 feet a night?<br><br>- - - - - - -<br><br>

If your red Shoryu jumps over the red button once, then it can walk over it on the return trip, leaving you free to manuever the purple Shoryu (ignoring the red one) once the red one snags the coin.  But if you trip the red button on the way in, then you have to either miss it on the way out, or jump over the spikes again on the way out with the red Shoryu before using the purple.<br><br>
20. ...3   ...3  ...4  ...4  ...1<br><br>
Scoring is only based on Getting Coin (20) and Completing Level Fast (max 20).<br><br>
To get the max score, you would play all 20 levels, /plus/ use your "extra plays" to get three more coins on levels where you collect the coin but then click Retry.<br><br>The max score is 20 levels  times 40 points = 800, plus 3 coins on levels you retry, = max 860.  (Due to impossibility of completing /every/ level fast enough to get 20 time points, the max real score seems to be 853 or so.)<br><br>
Strategy:  If you are slow on a level because of a missed button or whatever, work to collect the coin, then restart that level, since you will need to retry three levels anyway to get a max score.<br><br></p>

You've been transported to a spaceship! In space! There are lots of flashing lights and buttons and switches, and you want to just run and press them all.<br>However, there's a strange looking scientist here and he might object to wayward button pushing, seeing as it's his spaceship.<br><br>You made it!" the scientist cries. "Oh, thank goodness, I thought I was going to have to resort to smoke signals. Scintilly guided you through the portal, then? Good. I'm Dr Landelbrot. This is my spaceship, the The Coincidence. I'm glad you're here; we can begin immediately. Begin what? Oh, I've gotten ahead of myself again." He coughs.<br><br>My Random Event machine is malfunctioning. What, you thought Random Events just happened randomly? Pish tosh! Back in the early days of Moltara, I invented a technology to create chaos. Just as Moltara maintains balance with the fiery magma at its core, so too must we balance order with chaos. I took it upon myself to spawn random events, er, randomly. But I couldn't reach enough of the planet from underground, so I was forced to invent a spaceship. From space, I can cause probability vectors to instantiate virtually anywhere on the planet and its surrounding orbital bodies. I laid in a good supply of Cog Stew and Ionised Onions and have been here ever since. Only -- no doubt due to an aspect of chaos theory I haven't been able to interpret yet -- my Random Event machine has, well, stopped.<br><br>
Dr Landelbrot brightens. "That's why you're here. I need your help to fix it. Don't worry, it isn't hard, but I appear to be missing some key materials.<br>I need you to acquire them for me. Will you help me repair my machine? Your Random Events are at stake.<br><br><br>
Good work! I knew I could rely on you to help me fix the machine. We'll have it running again soon. Here, take this component. I found it lying around -- I mean,<br>I fashioned it just for you. I'm sure it'll be useful eventually. Put it down, though. We've got more work to do.<br><br>

Before you is Dr Landelbrot, a brilliant scientist. He's standing between you and all of the shiny buttons. It's like he wants you to focus on the task at hand instead of going wild flipping toggles and pressing keys. This is a spaceship, though! Who is he kidding? Eh, maybe you should be listening to what he's saying.<br><br>

Behold, I have fixed the Random Event machine! You make a fine assistant. Oh, you want a prize? I thought having a working Random Events machine would be reward enough. It's not like we're saving the world from a maniacal sorceress. That deserves a medal. Still, I suppose I can part with this, since you did help a lot.<br><br>

So how do you score better on this game? Your score rises quickly if you can manage an unbroken train of plushies produced. The first round requires 10 plushies to beat the round. If you can do that in an unbroken train of plushies, your score can be in the range of 120 to 150 (or even higher!)<br><br>
So, unbroken train. Uh, how? One technique is to start each round the same way. Notice what plushie color is the first to be built, and how many of it will be built. The first goal is to fill or nearly fill the paint vats that are /not/ needed to make the plushie. If the plushie is two or three colors, pick one of the colors and keep that paint vat below the amount of paint needed. Ignore the Thief for now. When the other paint vats are full or nearly so, look for a large paint balloon in the req'd color or several medium-sized balloons in a row, so the req'd paint vat will be filled or nearly so in a short time. The first plushie is made, your train has begun!<br><br>
When the "train" is rolling, watch for and get rid of that Thief! Also watch your colors and keep the vats as full as you can (try not to waste much paint, and avoid the "bad paint" balloons). If you get an entire train past the Thief, unbroken, congrats, that's a winning round!<br><br>
Keep winning rounds or getting the trains past the Thief as well as you can (it sure isn't easy, is it?) ;-) For each higher round, allow a little less time to get everything ready (paint vats full) before you accept the req'd paint balloon and start the train. By level 5, you shouldn't delay the start of the train much at all, by getting ready.<br><br><b>Game Boosts</b><br><br>
Eraser/cleaner - Always click on it, if you can. Clean is green! (or something like that).<br><br>
Slow Down - Careful. This is great to use just before starting a train of plushies, but should not be used when a train has already been delivering plushies.<br><br>
Speed Up - Careful, again. Only use when the end of the train is on the screen. If the end is not on the screen yet, it will cause a broken train.<br><br>
Angel - Use to fill vats! If you are a great shot, you can "bless" one of the plushies for extra points by dropping an angel on its' head.<br><br>
Upgrade - Use these whenever a train is running, for a boost in points.<br><br>
Extra Time - Yes, totally. Always. :-D<br><br>
Fill All Vats - These are great! (If you get one, click it.)<br><br>
More ideas: Set a 1st round minimum score. 110? 115? 120? If  you don't end Round 1 with that score, restart the game and do better. You could also choose minimums for 2nd round, even 3rd round, and for final score.<br><br>
Also there is a situation when the Thief can /help/ you! If you start a train, but because of the paint balloons available the train is only 1 plushie long, /let the Thief take that one/, and work on getting a /long/ train going. :-)<br><br>

<b>Neopets Lottery</b><br><br></center>
Neopets offers a daily <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/lottery.phtml">Lottery</a> you can buy tickets for. Tickets cost 100 NP apiece, and you can buy 20 each Neopian day. (20 tix cost 2,000 NP.) The lottery prize fund starts at 5,000 NP (chipped in by TNT) and gets larger with every ticket sold. Jackpots have ranged over 2 million, I'm told, but currently are usually less than 1 million. *Feb 2021 update -- less than 400,000 NP.<br><br>

Once they draw the winners, the people who match the most numbers win! When no one matches all 6 numbers, there may be a handful of 5-number matches that win. Or dozens of 4-number matches. Each winning ticket earns an equal share of the total prize fund. (Players can have more than 1 winning ticket in each game, and collect the prize for each winning ticket.)<br><br>

Sometimes a Random Event will award a lottery ticket, so you may have more than 20 tickets for a game. And if you can manage the timing, you can have 40 (or more, with Random Events) tickets in a game! If you buy 20 tickets /after/ the draw (which happens around 8:40 PM NST (more like 9 PM NST as of Feb 2021) ) but before midnight NST, then those are your 20 tickets for that day. Then after midnight NST you can buy 20 more tickets, and you'll have 40 tix for the next draw. You would miss playing in the earlier draw, but have extra chances for the second draw. (If you want to be sure the lottery draw has happened, open the <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/lottery.phtml">Neo Lottery</a> page and check the prize pool; if it is less than 50,000 NP, then the draw for the day has happened.) <br><br>

When you win, TNT will send you an Email (not a NeoMail) with congratulations. The first time you win, and then visit the Lottery page again, you'll receive the avatar. Trophies are awarded based on the amount of NPs you win. Win less than 500K for a Bronze trophy. Win 500K or more, up to 1 million, for a Silver trophy. Win more than 1 million NPs? Gold trophy! :-D

<b>Making Bookmarks for Neopets Lottery Tickets</b><br>
*(but look below for the Lottery Broke section)<br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~QuesGuess#LottWorkAround">Link For Alternative To Bookmarked Picks</a><br><br></center>

Saving your own lottery tickets for the Neopets lottery can make entering the lottery a breeze. There are also sites that offer easy random ticket entry, like JellyNeo's:<br><br><a href="/">JellyNeo lottery page</a><br><br>
and petpages with saved lists of numbers, like these:
<br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Saurich">Saurich page</a><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Megaura">Megaura page</a><br><br>

A quick discussion: Daily random numbers, or repeated chosen (or random) numbers? The lottery picks random numbers, so does it matter? Hard to say; I like repeating my picks so the random daily picks of the game "have a target," but, either way can work.<br><br>
So, how do you save your numbers? Here is the text for a link you can copy into a blank (new page) tab and paste it in, and buy a ticket with these numbers:<br><br>
//www.neopets.com/games/process_lottery.phtml?one=6&amp;two=11&amp;three=18&amp;four=22&amp;five=25&amp;six=30
<br><br>You can /bookmark/ this page and call it something like Lotto 1 or Lotto 6-11-18-22-25-30 or whatever. Then you can bookmark the page again and call it Lotto 2 or whatever, and keep bookmarking the page until you have 20 of the bookmarks.<br><br>
Now you can /edit/ the bookmarks and change the numbers, choosing your lottery ticket picks. The written-out numbers, like "one" and "two," are needed to do the ticket purchase correctly. But the numeric numbers, like "6" and "11," are the numbers of the lottery pick. Change the numeric-written numbers for your bookmarks to the numbers you would like for your tickets.<br><br>
Another nice thing you can do (in the browser Chrome, at least) is to create a bookmark group, and put bookmarks into it, and then open all the bookmarks inside of the group at once. I have 4 groups that have 5 ticket bookmarks in each. I point the mouse at the first lotto ticket group, right-click, and choose Open All (5) In New (Window). *(Sorry, the filters made me use parenthesis on "window" to get it to show there.)*<br><br>Then in the new window, I point at the next group of tickets and choose Open All (5). I like this method because once all 20 tickets are open, and one of the later ticket tabs shows that I have 20 tickets, I can /close/ the one window which /closes/ all 20 tabs. Easy! :-)<br><br><br><a id="LottoBroke"></a><br><center>
<b>Lottery Broke (since Oct. 2020)</b><br><br></center>

The Neo Lottery is sorta broke. It still works, and has draws daily (nightly) and awards NPs, Avatars, and Trophies. But the Neo Lottery used to accept entering tickets by just clicking a saved (bookmarked) link (which was very easy), but now you have to have numbers entered into the little boxes on the Lottery page. Being "broken" has reduced the number of players by a lot.<br><br>

If you are trying for the Avatar, or just "a trophy," that is sweet news. Whoever gets the most matches each draw wins, and if there are fewer people 
entering tickets each draw, that raises the chances of a Win. Winning the Neo Lottery earns an Avatar (awarded when you re-visit the Neo Lottery page) and at least a Bronze Trophy.<br><br>

If you are trying for a Silver or Gold Trophy, less entries is a bad thing. Trophies are awarded by the amount of NPs you /win/. If you win at least 1 NP, that is worth a Bronze trophy. If you win 500,000 NP or more, that is worth a Silver trophy. If you win 1,000,000 NP or more, that earns you the Gold trophy. (Your User Lookup page shows the best trophy for each game you have earned, so Silver would replace Bronze, and Gold would top them both.) The Neo Lottery being sorta broken has dropped the entries significantly. Shortly before it "broke" the prize pools were typically over 1,000,000 each draw. Since it "broke" pools have been in the 300,000 to 350,000 NP range, typically. For now, Silver and Gold trophies for the Neo Lottery are out of reach. :-(<br><br>

The Neo Lottery page is also showing signs of being "broken." The Neo Lottery page /should show/ the most recent 20 or so game results (including who won, what the prize pool was, what the winning share of the pool was for each winner, the date, and the winning numbers). But what it shows is the date of /your/ most recent win (even if it was years ago), and who were the winners on that date. The numbers for the prize pool and prize share are both 0 and the winning numbers are not shown. If you have never won, that area near the bottom will be blank. Unless, your user name is a part of a user name of someone who won, then you would see when /they/ last won. For example, if your UN is jj and someone with UN of jjrox won, then you could see the info about when jjrox won.<br><br>

So, with the Neo Lottery "broke," if you are looking for an Avatar or just any trophy, this is a great time to play. Buy 20 tickets (or as many as you have the patience to enter). Trying for a Silver or Gold trophy? More ticket buyers are needed to get those prize pools higher. :/<br><br><br><a id="LottoTips"></a><br><center>
<b>Lottery Tips(?)</b><br><br></center>

So, which numbers will win? Which numbers are best?!? I don't know of any better sources for numbers than just picking them. :(<br><br>

Personally I think the best way to approach this game is to have bookmarked numbers, so your numbers are always covered, and you're just waiting for the random draw numbers to match your numbers. ;)<br><br>

You could try to at least cover every possible pair, but /that/ can't be done, not with only 20 tickets. Let's try a smaller goal of covering every pair that three numbers have, and make our three numbers 1, 5, and 12 (why not?) :)<br><br>

So have picks 1, 5, and 12, and add the other numbers. 2, 3, 4 makes one ticket. 6, 7, 8 makes the second ticket. 9, 10, 11 makes # 3. 13, 14, 15, and 16, 17, 18, and 19, 20, 21 finish tickets 4, 5, and 6. 22, 23, 24, then 25, 26, 27, and finally 28. 29, 30, fill out tickets 7, 8, and 9.<br><br>

We could pick 3 other numbers, and cover all the pairs with those 3, but that would use up most of our 20 tickets. We could cover a few pairs for a third set of numbers, before we get maxxed out on tickets.<br><br>

If you were actually going to try something like this, you probably wouldn't want your "fill up" numbers to all be consecutive. With 1, 5, and 12, you could have 2, 3, and 21, then 4, 5, and 22, then 6, 7, 23, etc.<br><br>

Or maybe having equal counts of each number appeals to you. With 6 numbers per ticket and 20 tickets per day, that's 120 numbers. With 30 numbers to pick from, that's a count of 4 for each number, 1 thru 30. Stated another way, in 20 tickets, you could have the number 1 four times, the number 12 four times, 18 four times, 30 four times, etc.<br><br>

As I said, my preference is for bookmarked numbers, but people can and do win with random picks. I can't point to a continuing string of wins and say, "See, I told you so." ;)<br><br><BR><BR><BR>
