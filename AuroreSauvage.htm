      <p>My set : Bent Fork, Flame Reflectorzap &amp; Triple Turbo Dryer      </p>
      <p>But 15,000HP takes a long time to dig in, while it spams with its abilities preventing me much of the time to heal. The only solution I see is a pet with a lot of HPs with a Wodf, healing only once in a while.</p>
      <p>Result : UniClaude at 7000HP - 0/10 The lowest I was able to take it down was 5.61k without using my freezer &amp; Lens flare. If I use everything the best I was able to do is to take it down to 2.1k. It means if I'm lucky and it uses its jade soon I may be able to take it down once in a while. Not worth yet for UniClaude </p>
      <p>UniClaude at 9900HP : Much better and with a Hubrids box : 4 wins 2 losses </p>
      <p>Update 2019 - I got a Reflectozap 2000. UniClaude 12,000 HP. 9/10 on strong difficulty </p>
      <p>Update 2022 - UniClaude 15500 HP. Got it on mighty :) </p>

      It uses its Warlock Rage, Lens Flare &amp; Rejuvenate as many times as it wants<br><br>
        UniClaude 7000 HP : 2/10 on Strong

        <p>A Rod of Dark Nova would be better

</p><p>
It takes a long time to dig in through 17,500HP. It has many weapons with different types of icons.
</p><p>
Luckily it doesn't use it's Golden Butter Knife too often (maybe never on Strong). And it doesn't have a healer nor use Rejuvenate.
</p><p>
Result : UniClaude 7000 HP 0/10 I need more HPs for the Wodf to save me.
</p><p>
Update 2020 - UniClaude at 13,000 HP : not much better
</p><p>
</p><p>Update 2021 - UniClaude at almost 14,000 HP : About 50/50 (I started to use the Hubrids Puzzle Box)
</p><p>
Update 1/2022 - UniClaude at 15,000 HP ,  added a Thyora Tear  Result: 8/10
</p><p>
Update 4/2022 - UniClaude at 15,500 HP. Got it on mighty  7575 HP left but after 21 losses

        <p>Defend as much as you can while waiting that she uses her Jade. </p>
        <p>My set :  Bent Fork, Wodf, Flame Reflectozap. A  Reflectozap 2000 would help.</p>
        <p> At 7100HP (UniClaude)  score is  7/10 on Strong (  full HP) </p>
        <p>At HP 7800 I added Superior Reflection Shield</p>
<p>Score 9/10  full HP(from 7800 HP)</p>
<p>I tried with a Hubrids box : Not much better</p>
<p>Change of tactics : As she can use her tempest as many times as she wants, you can't rely on the Wodf to heal. So I sacrifice my Jade , .. and it works .. no more losses (but less full HP wins). I added a Frozen Cyodrake Shield to block 100% her Fire while waiting that she uses her Jade.</p>
<p>But as she can use her Rejunevate as many times as she wants, it will never be a 100% sure win.</p>
<p>Update 2019 - I got a Reflectozap 2000. No need for the Frozen Cyodrake Shield and Flame Reflectozap. A lot better 9/10 on Mighty difficulty</p><p>

      <p>Then I switch to the Ultimate Dark Reflectorb &amp; Flame Reflectorzap</p>
      <p>Result : UniClaude 7000 HP - 0/5 The lowest I was able to take it down was 14k(out of 15k) (without using my freezer &amp; abilities). It uses the Tempest ability too often. I would need a really big pet to be able to heal once in a while.</p>
