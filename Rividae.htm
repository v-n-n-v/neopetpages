So far I've just been designing Kaus but I'll stark working around to other species with unreleased colors. Next for me is Oil Paint Kau and Mosaic Kau.
 <br><br><a href="//www.neopets.com/~Huntingtun"> 
<br>
Here was my process for designing the Burlap Kau</a>
<br><br><br>
--------
<br>
-- Relic Kau Concept --
<br><br>
This was the one I started with, I'm debating giving him a pedestal to stand on like the Relic Peophin and a few others. This one having a rusted, aged bell on his neck makes him one of my personal favorites
<br>
EDIT- 12/6/23 added a pedestal, more fault lines in the stone, more moss and foliage, and color tweaked

<br><br>
-- 8-Bit Kau Concept --
<br><br>
I noticed most 8-bit pets are blue and I'm unsure if that's something I want to lean into, so for now, spotted 8-bit. Pose was eyeballed right off the UC Faerie Kau fighting pose
<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cmRqQRB.png"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bllj0Bo.png"><br>

12/22/23 Red and Blue version I found in my files!

<br><br>
 --Valentine Kau Concept --
<br><br>
This one is still more of a work in progress. Are the hearts too excessive? Should it just have it's normal stripes? Unsure yet

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/p38MsxP.png"><br><br>

<br><br>
-- Snow Kau Concept --
<br><br>
I have an alternate version of this where the horns are just snow. Might make a coal horn version too. I'm posting this one because I made a matching plushie lol

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FyM6drG.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7ffzCml.png"><br>

<br><br>
 --Toy Kau Concept --
<br><br>
I love this one ;; I'll render the fuzz more in a bit, but this is postable. Really struggled to land on what kind of cow toy I wanted to base this on but a simple plush suits it.

<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/41sMKqX.png"><br><br>

<br><br>
 --Peach Kau Concept --
<br><br>
This was based on a suggestion I received a few months ago.
I firmly think that pets other that the Chia should have fruit based colors. I'd like to make a Watermelon Kau next :)
