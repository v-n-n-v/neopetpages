<br><div class="minternal">Before posting on the boards, writing a profile, or doing anything else, I would recommend thoroughly reading over the rules of Neopets. It can be easy to break a rule without realizing it, so always be conscious of your actions. 

Neopets is a strictly G-rated environment, so the boards, as well as any area where you are able to write in your own text, are strictly monitored. Personally I enjoy the light environment. It helps make the site a fun place and an escape from any stress 

in real life. <br><br><center><a href="/terms.phtml">Click here for the official Neopets Terms and Conditions.</a></center>
<br>

I'm not going to retype the rules, just read them on the official page. Overall, keep in mind that Neopets is meant to be an enjoyable G-rated environment and anything you do to 

cause stress to others will get you in trouble. All kinds of people play 

Neopets, so be respectful. While all ages play the site, it is meant to be appropriate for very young children. Bad language is an obvious don't. Don't do anything to deceive other 

players, advertise your real life opinions on serious issues, profit unfairly, 

or sneak past the rules. Breaking the rules will get you either warned, suspended, or ultimately frozen. <br><br>

Always remember that Neopets is a community that is very sheltered from the rest of the internet. It is an escape and a carefree place to play without thinking about anything BUT 

Neopets. For that reason, don't talk about other games, other websites, 

or real life issues. Even mentioning other websites could get you a warning from Neopets.<br><br>
Remember that you are a guest on this FREE website, and if you break the rules Neopets has every right to punish you.

</div>
<br><div class="minternal">You will notice that Neopets does have a board system. Anyone 13 years and older is free to post. The boards on Neopets are <i>not</i> meant for casual chat. (Casual chat within the site rules is okay in most guilds, however.) Everything on the boards must be related to Neopets in some way, and posting anything unrelated could get you in trouble. The boards are meant to be smooth and on topic, focusing all discussion to that specific area of Neopets. I would 

recommend reading the chat rules:<br><br><center><a href="/chatrules.phtml">Click here for the official Neopets Board Rules.</a></center>
<br>

All site rules apply to the boards. Discussion is to be kept on topic and away from real life issues. There is no need for discussion about anything but Neopets. The boards are mostly just for commerce and getting help for Neo-related questions.

<br><div class="minternal">
<font class="subh">What is Neomail?</font><br>Neomail is a 1:1 private conversation with another user. Anyone over 13 has the option to <a href="/neomessages.phtml">Neomail</a> any user on the site. 

Neomails, unlike the boards, are meant for casual conversation. All Neopets rules apply to Neomail. Don't think you can get away with typing something against the rules in a 

Neomail just because it is only to another user. Users can report any 

suspicious neomails to a monitor. Plus monitors have the ability to read personal Neomails if they suspect the content breaks the rules. <br><br><font class="subh">How do I go about Neomailing a user I don't know?</font><br>If you want to Neomail a user you don't know, you should always read their userlookup first. This 

can be done by typing their username into the search box on the 

lefthand side of any Neopets page. Often people will put the answers to common questions, such as whether or not they want to join guilds, trade items, or battle, on their 

userlookup. Reading this information before Neomailing will eliminate bothering 

the person with a question they have already answered.<br><br><font class="subh">What do I do to Neomail a person about an item they have for sale?</font>
<br>If you are neomailing about an item in a user's shop or trades, be sure to read their shop or trading wishlist thoroughly. Neomailing to ask for a discount will only get people mad. You could even get yourself in trouble because asking for discounts is begging, which is a reportable offense. Usually people will establish clearly what they want (either in their trade description or just the price tag in their shop) and asking to give them anything else in exchange will only get you ignored.
<br><br><font class="subh">What if I don't want strangers to contact me? How do I change my Neomail settings?</font><br>
When someone first creates an account, provided they are over 13, their Neomail is set so that they can contact any user and any user can contact them. If you wish to change that, <a href="/preferences.phtml">go here</a>. You have the option to make it so that only your Neofriends (users that you have added to your list) can contact you. This is good for younger users or those that really do not want to be bothered. However, checking this option makes it VERY annoying if someone who is not your Neofriend needs to contact you.
<br><br><font class="subh">So what if I need to contact someone who has Neomail set to friends only?</font><br>
Sometimes people will send a Neomail, but have theirs set to friends only so you cannot reply. If you don't want to request to become that person's friend, there are a few ways to contact them. A popular method is to send that person a junk/1NP item. 

This is a common gesture that usually lets people know that something is wrong with their Neomail and you cannot contact them. Another way is to send that person a challenge from the Battledome. You can type a message to another person in the 

challenge to let them know their Neomail is set to friends only.

<br><br><font class="subh">What if I need to contact someone with a full Neomail inbox?</font><br>
You can only receive 100 Neomails. Once you reach that many, no one else can send you any new messages before you delete some of the old ones. If someone's inbox is full and 

cannot be contacted, use the same methods as listed above.

<br><br><font class="subh">What if someone sends me an inappropriate Neomail?</font><br>
If you receive a Neomail that breaks the rules, you can report it to a site moderator. All neomails should have a link above them to go to a report form.

<br><br><font class="subh">What if I want to block a user from contacting me?</font><br>
Go to the <a href="/block.phtml">block page</a> to list users you wish to block.

<font class="subh">What exactly are Neofriends?</font><br>Neofriends are users that are added to each other's exclusive contact lists. If a user is your 

Neofriend and they are online_  you will see their name on the left-hand 

side under the box that says Neofriends. <br><br><font class="subh">What is the benefit to having a user be my Neofriend?</font><br>There really is no benefit. The only special thing about being Neofriends is seeing when the 

other person is online_  Also, you can contact each other regardless of 

friends only Neomail settings. <br><br><font class="subh">How do I make Neofriends?</font><br>If you are talking to a user on the boards or over Neomail, you can ask them if they'd like to become Neofriends. 

<br><br><font class="subh">How do I add someone to my Neofriends list?</font><br>Type their name into the search box to go to their userlookup. From there you should see a smiley 

face icon that says Neofriend underneath it. Clicking that adds them, but 

the person must confirm in order for you to be considered Neofriends.<br><br><font class="subh">X Person has really cool pets and stuff! Can I request to be their Neofriend?</font><br>The unspoken rule around Neopets is that to request to be someone's 

Neofriend you should talk to them first. Sending a random request out 

of the blue is considered rude.  Plus many users block Neofriend requests for this reason. Many people think that seeing when strangers are online is creepy and prefer not to have 

Neofriends. Others want to collect as many Neofriends as they can. 

Again, read the userlookup of any person you want to add. That will usually tell you if the person wants Neofriends.

<b>n00b</b> is a derogatory term that means a player is rude, inexperienced, and  above all bad at playing the game.<br><br><center><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td width="330">

So as you can see, newbies are often confused and innocent, asking questions about the game and trying to figure things out on their own. Newbies may be confused and not know 

the rules, whereas n00bs act rudely on purpose and often try to get away 

with breaking rules. The term n00b has nothing to do with account age and can refer to any player who is acting immaturely or doing something to draw attention to themself.

<font class="subh">What is a side account and main account?</font><br>When you sign up for Neopets, your first account is usually considered your MAIN account. A main account is the account you use to play all games on Neopets. You can do dailies, play games, or any of the other activities around the site on your main account. A SIDE account is an account that cannot play games, do dailies, or earn Neopoints in any way. A side account serves the purpose of storage. You are allowed to have up to 20 Neopets (4 on your main account and up to 16 others on 4 side accounts) if you choose. The only purpose of a side account is having more Neopets, petpages, storage, or an extra item gallery.

<br><br><font class="subh">How many side accounts can I have?</font><br>As established, you can have ONE main account and up to 4 side accounts. <br><br><font class="subh">How do I make an account my side account?</font><br>To make a side account, simply log out and sign up again. Make sure to use the same e-mail address 

as your main account when making a side account. This lets Neopets 

staff know that the accounts are linked. <br><br><font class="subh">What CAN'T I do on a side account?</font><br>A side account cannot make Neopoints. This means you can NOT restock, play games, do dailies, or do 

anything that would result in Neopoints being generated on that account. You 

cannot have a shop. If it makes a profit, you cannot do it. That's the simplest rule. Always follow that and you should be okay. <br><br><font class="subh">What CAN I do on a side account?</font><br>You can visit the Soup Kitchen on a side account to get free food for your pets so they don't go hungry. You can 

claim the free 150 Neocash at the mall to dress up your pets. You can 

store items and Neopoints that were sent over from your main account. You can chat on the boards or over Neomail. Side accounts can also join guilds. You can use the petpages of 

your side account pets to host information, and side accounts can 

have galleries to display item collections. However, the gallery must be funded entirely from the main account.<br><br><font class="subh">How does Neopets know if an account is a side account?</font><br>Other than being linked by the same e-mail address, Neopets can tell if two accounts were created and accessed from the same computer. All computers have an IP address. An IP address is like DNA. All humans are unique based on their DNA, just like all computers have a unique IP address. If two accounts are accessed from the same IP address, they may be one person using multiple accounts. Depending on the activity within the accounts, Neopets staff can tell.

<br><br><font class="subh">But what if siblings/parents use the same computer?</font><br>Neopets understands that siblings and families often share computers. If two people use the same computer, use different e-mail addresses for the accounts.  Neopets has also said that they can identify if different people are playing (even if they are using the same computer), because everybody does slightly different things on the site.

<br><br><font class="subh">What happens if I purposely earn NP on my side account?</font><br>If you do dailies or earn NP regularly on a side account, all of your accounts will most likely be disabled. Neopets is supposed to be a fair game, and using multiple accounts to profit gives you an unfair advantage.
<br><br><font class="subh">What happens if I accidentally played a game on my side account?</font><br>If you accidentally played a game or made Neopoints on your side account, don't panic. Neopets understands that people make mistakes, so as long as it doesn't happen again you should be fine. Just remember to be careful when on a side account. Always look at the username you're logged into before doing anything. If you accidentally played a game, donate any Neopoints you earned to the <a href="/donations.phtml">Money Tree</a> and make a mental note not to do it again.
<br><br><font class="subh">What if I want to buy an item for a pet on my side account?</font><br>Any buying should take place on the main account. Just buy the item with Neopoints on your main, then send it to your side.<br><br><font class="subh">What if I get a random event on my side account?</font>
<br>Any items earned from random events on side accounts can be kept and sent to your main account. Random events are out of your control, so Neopets has said that you are free to keep any items from them.

<font class="subh">Scammers are out there. Be careful.</font><br>Be aware that not all Neopets users have the best intentions. Many people play dishonestly and can try to trick you, or even steal your account. If you fall for a scam you risk losing your Neopoints or even your account. Know that if your account is taken, it will most likely be frozen. Keep a clear head to prevent that. If you remember a few rules overall, you should be fine. 
<br><br><font class="subh">If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</font><br> No one is going to give a stranger a paint brush or rare item for free. Don't fall for promises of free items. If the user claims that they will give you an item if you Neomail them, ignore them. If someone claims an item is magic and will result in paint brushes or increased luck when opened, don't trust them. 
<br><br><font class="subh">NEVER give away your account information to anyone.</font><br> If anyone or anything asks you for your account information, other than an OFFICIAL 

NEOPETS.COM LOGIN PAGE, do not give it up. This is the most obvious 

rule ever, but a surprising number of players fall for people asking for account information. It doesn't matter who someone is. Never give your Neopets login or pin number to 

anyone. Not to your best friend, not to your sister, not even to your mother. 

Your information is YOURS alone.<br><br><font class="subh">If someone says they are Neopets staff, they are NOT.</font><br> The ONLY account that is neopets staff is <b>theneopetsteam</b>. Any official messages 

from Neopets will come from that account and that account only. No 

one asking for your information is Neopets staff, no matter how convincing they sound. Neopets will never ask you for your information over neomail or e-mail, EVER. <br><br><font class="subh">Only trust pages that start with //www.neopets.com.</font><br> If a page does not start with NEOPETS.COM it can not be trusted. Never enter your 

information on a page that doesn't start with neopets.com. People can copy 

Neopets' layout and put it on other websites, so always double check the URL of the page before entering anything. If a link looks suspicious, don't even check it. Just ignore it and 

move on.<br><br><font class="subh">When buying, check names and pictures. Don't rush into buying the wrong item.</font><br> Many people will try to sell you items that look rare but are 

actually cheaper counterparts. For example, there is an item called Baby Paint 

Brush Plushie that looks like the real Baby Paint Brush. Only a Baby Paint Brush (600,000 NP) will color your Neopet baby. A Baby Paint Brush Plushie (20,000 NP) is only a toy 

and will not do anything. Check item names and descriptions and be 

careful if something sounds too cheap.<br><br><font class="subh">There is no such thing as a free lunch. Don't be greedy.</font><br> One of the best ways to lose your account is to be greedy and fall for something that's too 

good to be true. Work hard to earn your own items. Don't be swayed by 

people who claim they have a "neopoint generator" or "item duplicator." That's rubbish. <br><br><font class="subh">ALWAYS use a pin number for extra safety!</font><br> Even if someone guesses or steals your login information, your account may be saved if you have a pin 

number. By default, accounts do not have a pin number. You will need 

to set one up on <a href="/pin_prefs.phtml">this page</a>. A pin number is a four digit code that you must enter, if enabled, to withdraw any Neopoints or items 

from any area of the site. Though it may be a bit inconvenient at first, it 

protects your account. If someone steals your account they will not be able to access your bank account, shop, or safety deposit box unless they know your pin number.

<font class="subh">I thought Neopets was a free game. What is premium?</font><br>Neopets is completely free. You do not need to pay anything to 

enjoy the game and use 99% of its features. Premium is a optional, paid 

add-on to the game. It costs real money, but adds certain perks that normal users do not get. The NC Mall is the same. You can buy virtual clothes for your Neopet for real money. 

Whether or not you choose to pay for these services is completely up to 

you. Buying or not buying either will not majorly affect your gameplay.<br><br>I choose not to pay for Neopets, so premium is not my area of expertise, but if you want to learn 

more information about its paid features, <a href="/~Leto">Leto's petpage</a> offers a great guide.  <br>  Premium has recently been redone, so the above guide isn't updated yet.

<font class="subh">The first step to enjoying Neopets is creating a unique pet to care for.</font><br>Once you sign up, you will be prompted to create a pet. (Or <a href="/reg/page4.phtml">click here</a> to go to the page.) This is a very simple process, but listening to an explanation will make it clearer and easier to choose your pet. The create-a-pet screen looks something like this:
<br><br><center><img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/newbieguide/create.gif" class="bimg"></center>
<br><font class="subh">Select your Neopet's species.</font><br>On the create-a-pet page you will see the 42 available species you can make. There are 12 rare species that are not listed here and cannot be created normally, but I will cover that later. For your first pet you should choose one of the 42. Species does not matter when creating a pet, it simply determines appearance. No one species is "better" than another, so choose whichever you like. If you find the decision difficult, remember that this is only your first pet and you can have up to four on your account. Most species have unique habitats and are loosely based on real life animals.
<br><br><font class="subh">Select your Neopet's color.</font>
<br>When creating a pet you have the choice between the four base colors: red, yellow, green, and blue. Simply choose whichever is your favorite. Color does not matter and can be changed later. There are over 50 rare colors that you can pay Neopoints for if you want to change your pet later on.
<br><br><font class="subh">Give your Neopet a name.</font><br>Name is the most important attribute of a Neopet. Names must be unique to a pet and can NEVER be changed. You'll have to get creative when naming a pet, because no two pets on the entire site can have the same name. I prefer to make up names for pets that are a mixture of syllables that make up a real-sounding name. For example, I named one of my pets "Balmik." 

You can use numbers and underscores in a name, but I would recommend avoiding them if you can. It's entirely up to you what you name a pet, but some would say that numbers and underscores make the pet less original and "badly" named. 

<br><br><font class="subh">Give your Neopet a gender.</font><br>Gender may play a role in what you determine as your pet's personality. If you really feel the need to change your pet's gender, it can be done later on. However, doing that requires a very expensive potion, so you should choose wisely when first creating. 
<br><br><font class="subh">Choose where your pet lives, what it does, and how it greets others.</font><br>These do not matter at all. They are just for fun and to give you an idea of your pet's fictional personality. 
<br><br><font class="subh">Choose your Neopet's stats.</font><br>I would always recommend choosing option B for this. Strength is the most important out of those three stats, so if you plan to battle with your pet, choosing the highest strength will give you a slight advantage.

</tr></table><br><br><font class="subh">So how do I go about obtaining a rare species?</font><br> 
There are three main methods to go about doing this. Depending on your budget and which species you want, you will have to choose to work towards whichever method suits you best.
<br><br><img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/newbieguide/species-adopt.jpg" border="0" class="left"><b>Method 1: Adoption.</b> It is rare that someone will want to abandon a limited edition pet. If you are new, you can forget about this method for now because an account must be 4 months old to adopt any rare, limited edition, or expensive painted pet. If you are 4 months and you find someone willing to abandon/transfer a limited edition pet, you will have to talk to that person and tell them a bit about yourself to apply to adopt the pet.

<br><br><img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/newbieguide/species-morph.jpg" border="0" class="left"><b>Method 2: Morphing.</b> This is expensive, but it is the most common way to earn a rare pet. Items called morphing potions (abbreviation: MP) will turn an existing pet into a new species and color. For example, <i>Green Krawk Morphing Potion</i>  turns any existing pet into a green Krawk when consumed. Usually people morph to get the species then use a paint brush to change the pet's color. Potions are very expensive and can be found on the <a href="/island/tradingpost.phtml">Trading Post</a>.  <a href="/~Kudonic">This guide</a> can give you up-to-date prices on any morphing potion you happen to want.

<br><br><img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/newbieguide/species-plushie.jpg" border="0" class="left"><b>Method 3: Magical Plushies.</b> These must also be found on the <a href="/island/tradingpost.phtml">Trading Post</a>. Magical plushies are the same as morphing potions in that they turn your pet into that species and color. Plushies are not as common of a method, but they are the better method if you want a Chomby or Poogle. <b>ONLY PLUSHIES THAT HAVE "MAGICAL" IN THE NAME WILL WORK!</b> Don't be tricked into buying a regular plushie someone claims is magical.

<font class="subh">How do I make my pet a non-base color to make it more unique?</font><br>Making a Neopet a non-base color is the most common goal among all players. Using a magical paint brush is the most common way to do this. There are over 50 paint brush colors (and a few more that are so rare they cannot even be obtained with a paint brush) that can make your pet look more unique. 

Most people want a rarer pet that isn't just red, yellow, green, or blue. The most common way to color a pet is with a paint brush.
<br><br><font class="subh">What is a paint brush and how do I obtain one?</font><br>Paint brushes are items that will make your Neopet a rare color. All paint brushes can only be used ONCE, so be careful if you happen to come across one. There are a few methods of getting a paint brush:

<br><br><img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/newbieguide/side-babypb.jpg" border="0" class="left"><b>The Obvious Method: Buying one.</b> This is your best chance. 98% of people with paint brushes earn Neopoints over a long period and then buy them. Most paint brushes are very rare and must be bought from other players who were lucky enough to obtain them but didn't want to use them. Depending on the 
color, paint brushes will cost anywhere from 50,000 to 6,000,000 Neopoints. To buy a paint brush, search for it on the <a href="/island/tradingpost.phtml">Island Trading Post</a>. It is usually polite to Neomail a seller telling them an offer that matches their trading wishlist before offering on the 

trade.<br><br><img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/newbieguide/side-faeriepb.jpg" border="0" class="left"><b>The "In Your Dreams" Method: Finding one.</b> 

There is a ridiculously small chance that you will find a random paint brush in a random event while browsing the site. A character named Jacko the Phantom Painter appears and gives you a paint brush. The chance of this happening is about .000002%. It could be a basic colored paint brush, or it even could be a color as rare as Maraquan.  The downside to this is that it's random and you don't get to choose the color. Most people will never get this event during the entire time they play Neopets.

<br><br><img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/newbieguide/side-typb.jpg" border="0" class="left"><b>The Luck Method: Winning one.</b> This is another ridiculous chance, though the odds are perhaps slightly better than that of finding a paint brush. The daily activity <a href="/desert/fruitmachine.phtml">Fruit Machine</a> has about a .005% chance of giving away a paint brush. This paint brush is guaranteed not to be a base color. The <a href="/water/fishing.phtml">Underwater Fishing</a> game has a chance to give paint brushes, though only a handful of people have reported ever winning them. Various other chance games have a chance to award paint brushes, but the odds are so low they're barely worth mentioning.

<br><br><font class="subh">What colors are available to paint my pet?</font><br>Check out <a href="/pool/brushes.phtml">This list</a> at the Rainbow Pool for brush 

colors. If you want to see all the available colors for each species of 

Neopet, check out <a href="/pool/all_pb.phtml">this page</a>. It's very handy. You can waste so much time looking at the pet colors. =P

<br><br><font class="subh">How can I tell how much it costs</font><br><a href="/~Laonei">Laonei's awesome guide</a> lists the prices of all the paint brushes, as well as more useful information.

<br><br><font class="subh">What colors are the cheapest?</font><br>Base color (red, green, yellow, blue) paint brushes are usually under 100,000 NP. <i>Christmas Paint Brush</i> is 

given out yearly to every person in December. If you want a Christmas 

pet, you should wait until December when they are free. If you want to buy one during the year, they only cost about 50,000 NP. Second cheapest is the <i>Scritchy Sketchy Paint 

Brush</i>, which was once given away in mass quantities. These 

usually cost under 100,000 NP. In third place is <i>Cloud Paint Brush</i>, which was also given away and reduced. These are usually in the mid 100,000s and can be found on the 

<a href="/island/tradingpost.phtml">Trading 

Post</a>. <br><br><font class="subh">If I get a paint brush, where do I go to paint my pet?</font><br>Head on over to the <a href="/pool/index.phtml">Rainbow Pool</a> at Neopia

<font class="subh">What does it mean when people talk about "converted" pets?</font><br>A while ago, artists redrew all the Neopets. The art for the pets changed so that all 

colors of every species were in exactly the same pose. This allowed for 

clothing to be drawn in one position so it could easily fit all colors of a species. When the pets were redrawn, wearable clothing was introduced on the site. Examples of converted 

and unconverted pets can be seen on the left. Unconverted pets retain 

their unique artwork, while converted pets have to be in a default pose.<br><br><font class="subh">What colors of pets remained unconverted?</font><br>When the conversion went into effect, people with rare colored pets had the option to keep the original 

artwork or "convert" their pets so they could wear clothing. If you had a 

royal, faerie, grey, robot, baby, or any other rare colored pet that had artwork that made its pose somehow different from base colors, you could keep it the way it was. All base 

colored pets and pets created after the conversion will have the new 

artwork.<br><br><font class="subh">How does a pet become converted?</font><br>The only way a pet can become converted is if the owner of the pet chooses to convert it. Pounding or 

transfering a pet will not convert it. If you have a converted pet, this can be done 

from the <a href="/quickref.phtml">quick ref</a> page.  <br><br><font class="subh">How do I get an unconverted pet?</font><br>Unconverted pets are truly rare since there is no way to make new ones. The only way to get unconverted pet 

artwork is to adopt an unconverted pet. You can never get an unconverted 

pet if your pet is converted.

<font class="subh">What is wearable clothing?</font><br>Wearable clothing items, or "wearables" as people call them, can be found throughout Neopia. These items can be worn 

by most pet species and colors and will change the appearance of your 

pet all over the site to show it wearing that item. <br><br><font class="subh">Where do I get wearable clothing items to buy with Neopoints?</font><br>Clothing stocks at the <a href="/objects.phtml?type=shop">Clothing Shop</a>, but you have to be very fast to buy anything 

there. Most people use the <a href="/market.phtml?type=wizard">Shop Wizard</a> with an item already in mind. This lets them search for users who are selling 

that item. If a clothing item is rare and there are none on the Shop Wizard, 

there may be some on the <a href="/island/tradingpost.phtml">Trading Post</a> for over 100,000 Neopoints. <br><br><font class="subh">Are all clothing items wearable?</font><br>NO. You need to be careful when buying clothing items. There are many clothing items that can not be worn by any 

pets and are basically useless. If an item is wearable, it will say so on 

your <a href="/objects.phtml?type=inventory">inventory page</a> once you buy it.<br><br><font class="subh">But then how do I know if an item is wearable before I buy it?</font><br>It can be difficult to tell, but <a href="/~Qaindy">this petpage 

guide</a> is a valuable resource. It lists every wearable clothing item that can 

be purchased with Neopoints. It allows you to browse and preview clothing items. If you come across an item in a shop and you are not sure... <br><br><font class="subh">Can all species wear all wearable clothing items?</font><br>Unfortunately, no. If an item is wearable, assume it can be worn by all species UNLESS it has a 

species in its name. For example, <i>Bow Tie</i> is wearable by all 

kinds of Neopets, but <i>JubJub Rainbow Socks</i> is only wearable by JubJubs since it has JubJub in its name.<br><br><font class="subh">Can all pet colors wear all wearable clothing items?</font><br>Nope. There are restrictions. Due to their unique body shapes, mutant, Maraquan, and baby 

pets cannot wear clothing. Fruit colored Chias also cannot wear clothes. 

These pets can wear accessories and backgrounds, but not clothes. <br><br><font class="subh">What about paying real money for Neopets clothing?</font><br>This is also an option. Some people choose to spend money on Neocash, currency used in the 

<a href="/mall/shop.phtml">NC Mall</a> to purchase 

animated clothing and accessories. You can get 150 Neocash for free just by visiting the mall, so be sure to visit and get a free item. Neocash is completely optional, but if you 

really want to customize your Neopet with those items you can buy a card 

at Target stores in North America.<br><br><font class="subh">What is the benefit of customizing/clothing a Neopet?</font><br>The only benefit is seeing your Neopet's appearance change. Clothing does nothing special 

and is only decorative. Some people prefer clothing as a cheaper 

alternative to paint brushes. You can make your pet unique by giving it clothes instead of splurging on a very expensive paint job.

will see the petpet underneath the picture of the pet. Petpets are purely for decoration on lookups, though they have some very minor functions in a handful of games. For example,

to a pet that refuses it, try scrolling down to the bottom of the page and changing the site language to one with characters (like Chinese). For some reason this changes item settings and may cause your pet

expensive.<br><br><font class="subh">What does it mean to match a petpet?</font><br> Many people like to give pets petpets that resemble their species or color. For example, JubbyJubJack has a 

<i>Purple Fungree</i>, because I feel it matches his color. A Fungree 

looks a lot like a JubJub.  <a href="/~OceanPredator">Here</a> is a nice guide that explains various ways of matching and <a href="/~petpetmatcher">this guide</a> is a great way to match petpets to pets.

anything special. <br><br><font class="subh">What kinds of foods does my Neopet's species like?</font><br>Food has nothing to do with species. All neopets will eat all foods, unless they are picky. Some 

pets will randomly reject certain food items, but that has no connection 

to their species. <br><br><font class="subh">How do I know if my pet is hungry?</font><br>You should see your pet's hunger level on every page. It is displayed with the stats beneath the picture of your 

pets.<br><br><font class="subh">Can Neopets eat things that aren't classified as food items?</font><br>Only if your pet is a Skeith or Grarrl. Those pets can eat any item if you choose to feed 

it to them with the dropdown menu in popup windows. They can also 

randomly take items from your inventory and eat them, so be careful if you own one. <br><br><font class="subh">What is a gourmet food?</font><br>A gourmet food is any food with a <a href="#rarityindex">rarity index</a> between 90 and 100. Most gourmet foods are 

very expensive. Unless you plan on going for a <a href="/gourmet_club.phtml">Gourmet Club Trophy</a>, you don't need to worry about them.

<br><br><font class="subh">What if I don't have time to feed my pet?</font><br>  The <a href="/neolodge.phtml">Neolodge</a> is a cheap alternative to buying food, and you don't even have to take the time to feed your pets.  For 140nps a month at the lowest setting, the Neolodge keeps your pet bloated for 30 days.  This is extremely useful.

<font class="subh">What is mood and what does it do to my pets?</font><br>Mood is the level of happiness of your pet. You will see mood displayed with the stats below your 

Neopet's picture on every page. Mood is ranked in the following order, from 

worst to best: angry, miserable, depressed, unhappy, content, happy, cheerful, extremely happy, joyful, delighted. Any pets with a mood level of content or above are fine and will 

not do anything. Pets with a mood level of unhappy or below will require 

attention to bring up their mood.<br><br><font class="subh">What makes pet mood go down?</font><br>If pets are hungry their mood will drop, but the biggest influence on mood is <a href="#sickness">sickness</a>. A 

sick pet will ALWAYS have a low mood, so if you can't tell why your pet 

is unhappy, check to make sure it's not sick. Visiting your pet on the <a href="/quickref.phtml">quick ref</a> page should tell you. A sick pet will have "suffering 

from (disease name)" next to its mood. To read about curing pets, check 

the <a href="#sickness">next section</a>.<br><br><font class="subh">How do I increase my pet's mood?</font><br>If your pet is sick there is little you can do to increase mood until you cure it. If you have a normal pet that is 

unhappy, feed it first. After it has a hunger level of "not hungry" or higher, 

try grooming or playing with it. This can be done with any toy or grooming item in your inventory. You must play or groom your pet at least five times in order to see an increase in 

mood. If you need to buy a cheap grooming item, try <i>Pink Blush</i> 

for about 50 NP. A cheap toy is <i>Yellow Lupe Plushie</i> for about 15 NP.<br><br><font class="subh">What if mood is still low after playing and grooming?</font><br>Try taking your pet to the <a href="/worlds/roo/merrygoround.phtml">Roo 

Island Merry-go-Round</a>. Pay 50 NP for a ride and it may increase 

mood. <br><br><font class="subh">Is it true my pet will turn blue if its mood is low?</font><br>Yes. It's not guaranteed, but your pet may turn blue or red if its mood is consistantly low. Keep it 

happy to avoid that.

biggest newbie-trap ever and is a complete waste of Neopoints. Some 

cure items cost over 100,000 NP and will disappear once you use them to cure your pet. Never buy any items - you can cure any disease for free.<br><br><font class="subh">So how do I cure it for free?</font><br><a href="/faerieland/springs.phtml">Healing Springs</a> is a wonderful place. A water faerie there will 

give you free healing spells every 30 minutes. Just click on "heal my

completely random which of the three you get, so keep trying and you will 

eventually be cured free.<br><br><font class="subh">But the Water Faerie just gave me a potion... she didn't cure it and it didn't work.</font><br>Again, it's RANDOM. Keep going to the Healing Springs every 30

healed the first time and then go and waste their Neopoints on an item. Be patient and you will be rewarded. <br><br><font class="subh">What are the different diseases?</font><br><a href="/~Ebon">This page</a> and <a href="/~doctor_roo">this page</a> are a great resources for pet diseases and healing options.

You should do this first above any other method. It is cheaper than the other training school. Train for strength, health, defence, and level here until your pet is level 40. Courses here must be payed for with dubloons. At the beginning, each course will cost about 3,000 NP and give your pet 1 to 5 stat points in the selected area. Read my <a href="#codestones">dubloon section</a> on how to get dubloons.

<br><br><img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/newbieguide/side-codestone.jpg" border="0" class="left"><b>Method two: Train at the Mystery Island School.</b> You should start doing this after your pet is level 40. Unlike the other school, courses here cannot be cancelled once started. Courses here must be payed for in codestones, one or two depending on your pet's level. That means the courses will cost from 4,000 to 20,000 Neopoints. They also give a random 1-5 points in a selected stat, with 5 being the rarest. Read my <a href="#codestones">this section</a> on how to get codestones.

<br><br><img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/newbieguide/side-labthought.jpg" border="0" class="left"><b>Alternative method: Zap for stats.</b> Using the Lab Ray to zap your pets for stats is risky, but many people do it. You have no control over what color or species your pet will end up, so use carefully. The lab has a chance to grant stats, but it can also remove them. At higher levels it may be cost efficient, but it's always a gamble. The Lab Map must be purchased first, of course, and that costs from 700,000 to 1,000,000 Neopoints.

<br><br><img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/newbieguide/side-fqd.jpg" border="0" class="left"><b>Random stats: Faerie quests.</b> Faeries give quests randomly. The rewards are stat raises on your pets in exchange for an item. These are almost always a better value than training and they always affect your active pet. To read about which faeries give which stats, check out the <a href="#faequests">faerie quests section</a>.

<br><br><br><img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/newbieguide/side-neggf.jpg" border="0" class="left"><b>An expensive extra: Stat-raising neggs.</b> Certain neggs and items may raise pet stats, but are not worth it to buy. Just know that 

they are an option if you obtain them. The most common stat-raising foods are neggs. Not all raise stats, but some do. A few examples are the <i>Faerie Queen Negg</i> (+1 

health point), <i>Silver Knight Negg</i> (+1 defence point), and 

<i>Ferocious Negg</i> (+1-4 strength points). Beware of possible side-effects such as color changes!<br><br><br><font class="subh">What must I do to excel at the battledome and get good weapons?</font><br>

<br><br><font class="subh">What can I do to avoid bad random events?</font><br>
Bad random events always happen, but there are a few things you can do to prepare. Read on.<br><br><font class="subh">Have your lab rat or least expensive pet active.</font><br>
Since random events can change the paint color of your pet, have a base-color or cheap lab-rat pet active. These events cannot be reversed, but they only affect your active pet. 

Don't risk losing expensive paint colors. To choose which pet is active, 

go to the <a href="/quickref.phtml">quick ref page</a> and click on your pet's face. From there, select "make active.
<br><br><font class="subh">Keep your Neopoints in the bank. </font><br>Many random events take a percentage of Neopoints, not a set number. If you have all your NP out, that could be a very high number. Why put yourself at risk? Put your hard-earned points in the <a href="/bank.phtml">bank</a> to earn interest and keep safe.  Keep in mind that storing your Neopoints in the bank will not affect events that take a specific amount.  If an event takes 500nps and you only have 100nps with you, you will end up with negative 400.
<br><br><font class="subh">Keep a "Pant Devil Attractor" or two in your inventory. </font><br>Pant Devil Attractors are items that the Pant Devil prefers over others. They are very 

cheap. They cost about 300NP and can also be fished up from the 

Underwater Fishing game. Having several in your inventory gives you a very good chance not to get another item stolen by the Pant Devil. However, Pant Devil Attractors only 

prevent the Pant Devil stealing your items. There are several other random 

events that do the same thing and will not be thwarted by the item. However, he is the most common.<br><br><font class="subh">Keep your items in your Safety Deposit Box or shop.</font> <br>As mentioned, items are always at risk to be stolen or zapped through random events. If you 

have valuable items, keep them in your Safety Deposit Box, shop, or 

trades where they can't be affected. Only items in your inventory can be stolen.<br><br><font class="subh">Always be aware of random events.</font> <br>People often navigate through pages quickly and miss events happening. There is no such thing as an event 

log and you cannot remember past events unless you record them 

yourself.

You may find quests while browsing different worlds in Neopia.  You can accept a quest and receive a prize for doing it, but to complete the quest you must buy items using the <a href="/market.phtml?type=wizard">Shop Wizard</a>. The quests are called timed quests because you have a set time limit to bring back the items requested. They are also known as 10-per-day quests.<br><br><font class="subh">Are the quests worth doing?</font><br>
These quests are a waste 90% of the time. Newbies often find them and think they are important, but they are just the opposite. You will need to use your judgement to decide if a quest is worth doing. NEVER do a quest if it costs over 4,000 Neopoints.<br><br><font class="subh">So what if the quest isn't worth it and I don't want to do it?</font><br>
There is NO PENALTY for not doing a quest. To not do a quest, simply let the timer run out and ignore it. You can always try again if you abandon a quest.<br><br><font class="subh">How often can I do these quests?</font><br>
You can do any combination of <b>10</b> of these quests daily. For example, that means you could do 5 Edna and 5 Snow Faerie, 2 Edna and 8 Kitchen, etc. Illusen and Jhudora are on different timers. You can do 2 of those a day. 2 Jhudora, 2 Illusen, or one of each, regardless of the other 10 quests.
<br><br><font class="subh">How do I do one of the quests?</font><br>

Click on the quest giver you want to help. Once you click the accept button on their page, a list of item(s) will come up. You will also see your time limit to purchase the items. Go to the <a href="/market.phtml?type=wizard">Shop 
Wizard</a> and search for the items. Be sure to have "identical to my phrase" on the dropdown menu. BEFORE BUYING ANYTHING, search for all of the items and check their prices. If the prices of all the items combined equals under 4,000 Neopoints, you can take your chances and do the quest. If they cost over 4,000, I would not recommend doing it. If that's the case, just ignore the quest completely, don't buy anything, and wait for the time to run out.<br><br><font class="subh">Who are the different characters that give quests?</font>

<font class="subh">What is a random event faerie quest?</font><br>Every page you surf on Neopets has a chance to give you a random event or quest. A 

faerie quest is when a faerie comes up to you and asks you to buy her 

an item. If you get one it will pop up in big letters at the top of a page.<br><br><font class="subh">So how do I buy this item and what do I do?</font><br>You cannot use the Shop Wizard for faerie quests, but you can use the boards. Always go to the <a href="/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=9">Quest Help 

Neoboard</a> and post politely asking for someone to search for your item. A person should give you a username of someone who is selling that item. You then paste that 

username into the search box and visit their shop to buy the item. Try to avoid 

going to "mall" shops to buy the item since you can't use the Shop Wizard. Most malls charge 3 to 10 times the actual price of an item. Just go to the quest board and get help for a 

decent price.<br><br><font class="subh">So once I buy the item, where do I give it to the faerie?</font><br>Go to the <a href="/quests.phtml">quest building</a> in 

Faerieland.<br><br><font class="subh">So what is the reward?</font><br>Each faerie who gives quests has a different reward. You can read about those below. In general, the rewards are stats for 

your pet. These stats increase its numbers when it fights. If you're not 

into battling, you may not choose to spend your Neopoints on faerie quests. But know that a faerie quest is a very good value when it comes to the stats. Buying the item for the 

faerie will be much cheaper than paying for training to raise the

the Shop Wizard to find this item. Items for FFQs are rarer than others. 

You could get lucky and get one as cheap as 5,000 NP. You could get unlucky and get an item such as a Draik Egg. (Which costs 5 million+; it has happened.) A FFQ should 

NEVER be rejected. You can paint your pet colors that can't even be obtained

into random colors and species. It can also change their stats and gender.<br><br><font class="subh">How do I get access to the ray?</font><br>You must buy and combine all 9 unique pieces of the Secret Laboratory map.<br><br><font class="subh">How do I get lab map pieces?</font><br> You get pieces either through random events or buying them from others.<br><br><font class="subh">Where is the best place to buy them?</font><br> The best place to find Lab Map pieces is at the <a href="/island/tradingpost.phtml">Trading 

Post</a> on Mystery Island. Some are cheap enough to be found in 

shops, but the others cost over 100,000 and must be purchased on the post.<br><br><font class="subh">Wait, but they all have the same name. How do I find them?</font><br> Searching for "Secret Laboratory Map" will yield any of the nine pieces. Just keep 

searching and looking at the pictures... There is nothing that can be done 

about this and it makes it somewhat hard to track down pieces. If you right click and select "properties" on each of the map piece images you can see what number piece it is in the 

image URL. The piece numbers go down and to the right, so for 

example piece #1 is the top left corner, #2 is below it, etc.<br><br><font class="subh">If I buy and complete the map, can I resell it later or lend it to a friend?</font><br> No! Maps are non-refundable and non-transferrable once completed. If you 

have pieces in your inventory they can be sold, but once you combine 

them they are on your account forever. The pieces are gone and you have access to the lab.<br><br><font class="subh">How much should a complete map cost?</font><br> A complete map should cost anywhere from 700,000 to 1,000,000 NP. Be careful; some pieces are worth 

20k while others are worth 100k, so be sure to do thorough research 

before buying. You may find people offering a set of all 9 pieces for one price on the trading post. Sometimes this can be a good deal, but make sure to check the lot has all 9 

UNIQUE pieces.<br><br><font class="subh">So what happens once I combine the pieces? What does the lab do?</font><br> The Secret Laboratory is a daily activity that can randomly change the 

appearance of your pet. When you combine the pieces you win 10,000 NP and 

access to the daily zapping.<br><br><font class="subh">So I have no control over what happens? What can the lab do to a pet?</font><br> The Lab is 100% random. It can change your pet's species, color, and 

gender. Your pet can also gain or lose battledome stats. There is a small 

chance that nothing at all will happen on some zaps. Use the lab at your own risk! Do not use an expensive or rare pet that you care about as there is no guarantee it will keep its 

color or species.<br><br><font class="subh">What are the benefits of the lab? Should I invest?</font><br> It is entirely your decision. The lab is a very fun toy that makes any account feel more complete, 

though there is absolutely no profit to be made from it. Since it is 

random, some people may not want to take their chances to get a rare pet. Personally, I think it's a lot of fun and am glad to have it.<br><br><font class="subh">Are there any perks that I can only get from the lab?</font><br> Yep! If you are very lucky you may get your pet zapped into a "lab only" color. These colors 

can not be obtained through paint brushes or potions. Lab only colors 

are Sponge, Snot, Custard, Jelly, Robot, Ice, and Chocolate. If you have a JubJub it can turn Coconut. Grundos can become Mallow. Aishas can become Alien. If you have a Poogle 

it can turn into a mega-rare MSP. JubJubs and Kikos also have a 

chance to become Garlic or Clay.<br><br><font class="subh">Can I get rare species pets from the lab?</font><br> There is a miniscule chance you could get lucky and get a Draik, Lutari, or Krawk zap, but don't hold your 

breath. Any other Limited Edition species can be obtained more 

frequently but are still rare to get.<br><br><font class="subh">Once I get all the pieces, where do I put them together?</font><br> Go to <a href="/games/treasure.phtml">treasure maps</a> under 

games.

lend it, or give it to your friend. Like the lab map, it is on your account 

forever.<br><br><font class="subh">How much should a complete map cost?</font><br> Expect to pay no more than 10,000 NP for the PetPet map. This is, of course, in addition to the 700k Lab 

Map.<br><br><font class="subh">What is the PPL?</font><br> PetPet Protection League. It's a Neopets contest that randomly awards NP to people with very old petpets. If you zap your 

petpet it is automatically disqualified regardless of its age.<br><br><font class="subh">What can the lab to do petpets?</font><br> Petpets can change name, color, species, or level, or turn into a pile of soot. If you are unlucky your petpet will 

disappear completely and you will have to buy a new one. Always use a 

cheap petpet.<br><br><font class="subh">Can a pile of soot be rezapped?</font><br> Yes.<br><br><font class="subh">What are some cheap petpets to zap?</font><br> Try an <i>Altachuck</i> or <i>Abominable Snowball</i>. Both are under 1,000 NP.<br><br><font class="subh"> Are there any petpet colors unique to the lab?</font><br> You can only get Strawberry, Gold, Chocolate, and Jelly petpets from the lab.<br><br><font class="subh">If I zap a petpet can I take if off and sell it for profit? </font><br>Nope. The petpet lab is purely for fun. Removing a zapped petpet reverts it back to its original 

form. Zapped petpets also cannot be repainted.<br><br><font class="subh">If I get a Krawk can I make it into a Krawk pet?</font><br> Nope. <br><br><font class="subh">Once I get all the pieces, where do I put them together?</font><br> If you have BOTH lab maps, go to <a href="/games/treasure.phtml">treasure maps</a> under games to put together the petpet map.

<font class="subh">Who and what is Tarla?</font><br>Tarla is a pink Ixi who lives on Terror Mountain. She hosts mass item giveaways, often

pieces.<br><br><font class="subh">How do I get to her giveaways?</font><br>You must download the <a href="http://toolbar.neopets.com/">Neopets Toolbar</a> add-on for 

Internet Explorer or Firefox.<br><br><font class="subh">How do I know when there is a giveaway?</font><br>Once you have the toolbar installed, you will see a little button called "Alert." If Tarla is hosting a 

giveaway the alert button will flash yellow. All you have to do is click on the 

button and claim your prize. You can only win one prize per day from Tarla.<br><br><font class="subh">How long does the button flash for?</font><br>You will have to be quick because the button only flashes for about a five minute period. However, the button 

may flash several times a day to give people in different time zones a 

chance to claim prizes. If you click on the button within about the first 3 minutes, you will receive Tarla's main prize for the day. If you want and click it in about the last 2 minutes, 

you will receive a "drop link" prize which is different from the main prize. 

Many people choose to wait and get the drop link because it is sometimes a better value than the main prize. Waiting longer than about five minutes results in a <i>Tarla has left 

the building...</i> message.<br><br><font class="subh">What is the purpose of these giveaways?</font><br>One of the reasons for Tarla's giveaways is to combat inflation. Inflation is when currency is worth less, 

supply is low, and demand is great. Inflation results in items rising in 

price over time. When Tarla gives out an item in masses, the supply of the item increases to meet the demand, thus the item becomes worth less and the market becomes slightly 

more balanced.<br><br><font class="subh">Where can I see stuff Tarla has given out?</font><br><a href="/~Wudkins">This page</a> has a great Tarla guide with tons of information.

or who just wants to stash away all their hard-earned points.<br><br><font class="subh">So why should I use the bank?</font><br>Using the bank is important. Having all your Neopoints out on hand is very bad. <a href="#re">Random events</a> 

can take a percentage of your Neopoints, even as high as 25%. By 

keeping your earnings in the bank you protect yourself from losing large percentages. You even gain a percentage just by keeping it there. There's no reason not to use the 

bank.<br><br><font class="subh">How do I set up an account?</font><br>There should be a link when you first visit. You get 50 Neopoints for signing up. As for the bank form, none of the fields 

matter. Occupation and everything else is just a joke. Just choose 

whichever one makes you chuckle. It doesn't matter at all. <br><br><font class="subh">How does account interest work?</font><br>Interest, unlike in the real world, must be manually collected. Visit the bank every day and click the "collect 

interest" button. It is important that you remember to do this. Collecting 

interest will cause your bank account to grow steadily. <br><br><font class="subh">What are account types and how much interest do they give?</font><br>The more you put in, the more you get out. Account types rank higher and higher, and 

with each ascending rank you earn a higher percentage of interest. This 

percentage is of the total Neopoints you put in the bank. For example, the lowest account type, Junior Saver, is for anyone with under 1,000 NP in the bank. That account type gives 

you 4.5% yearly interest, meaning you would only collect 45 


Neopoints a YEAR from the bank. That would be under 1 NP per day. The highest account type, Ultimate Riches, gives 12.5% of your total Neopoints per year. This account type 

requires 10,000,000 Neopoints in the bank, but 12.5% of that yearly is 

1,250,000. You would get 3,400+ Neopoints daily by collecting interest, and that's a nice little chunk. <br><br><font class="subh">So what are the ranks for interest?</font><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2"><tr><td><b>Account Type</b></td>

achieved, regardless of what you currently have in the bank. For 

example, if you had Neopian Student (2,500 NP) but withdrew 1,600, that's 900 in the bank, which would fall into the next lowest rank. However, since you will always keep the 

interest percentage of the highest rank you've earned, you would still get the

<font class="subh">How do I earn Neopoints?</font><br>There are several methods. You can choose whichever is right for you. I consider games, 

restocking, sniping, the stock market, and site activities to be the main 

methods. A majority of people use games as their primary earning method.<br><br><font class="subh">What is each method like?</font><br><a href="#games"><b>Games: the steady method.</b></a> Play flash games daily to earn a steady income. Slow, but consistent. Best for new players.<br><a href="#rs"><b>Restocking: the speed method.</b></a> Purchase items from the Neopian shops and resell them for a profit.

Very dependent on luck.<br><a href="#stocks"><b>The Stocks: the sleeper method.</b></a> Invest in the stock market and wait months for gigantic profits.

Great if you enjoy creating things.<br><br><font class="subh">How do I choose which method is right for me?</font><br>
If you are new, I would recommend starting with games. There are hundreds of games and you are guaranteed to find some you are good at. Everyone plays games. Most people who 

do other methods pair them with games. For example, good stocks 

require an investment of 15,000 Neopoints daily. Games can easily make the Neopoints you need to invest in stocks or buy items to resell. After playing games, it's your 

choice what to do with the points. Either put them in the bank or invest 

them in stocks or items. It's up to you. You should try each method at some point to see which one fits you.

<font class="subh">What are the advantages to playing games to earn Neopoints?</font><br>Games are the most popular earning method and the 

easiest. Games are guaranteed to give you Neopoints, so unlike the other 

methods they are not as dependent on chance. You can sit down for a set time, play a few games, and walk away with some points to bank for the day. Games cause new Neopoints 

to flow into the economy, instead of restocking which elimiates or 

recycles them.<br><br><font class="subh">What are the disadvantages to playing games to earn Neopoints?</font><br>Games are very time consuming. Their earning power is limited when compared to 

methods such as <a href="#rs">restocking</a>. Games are capped 

at a 1,000 Neopoint payout per play, so you are not always guaranteed to get that much.<br><br><font class="subh">How do I know which flash games are good to play?</font><br>Try reading the <a href="/~jubbyjubjack#20k">games guide</a> on my main 

page for fast games. Learn how to make 20-33,000 NP in under an 

hour.<br><br><font class="subh">What is a good amount to make daily with games?</font><br>It depends on your goal. If you made 20,000 Neopoints daily, for example, that would result in 

600,000 per month. If you are going for a paint brush that is a pretty 

good number.<br><br><font class="subh">What if I'm not good at the games?</font><br>There are several games that are so easy you guaranteed at least 10,000 Neopoints. Play a few and 

experiment with the ones you like. There are hundreds of games out there, so 

you're guaranteed to find a few good ones.<br><br><font class="subh">Why should I play games?</font><br>You don't have to spend a lot of time playing games. But there are a few games that are simply a MUST. <a href="/play.phtml?game_id=807">Wheel of Slime</a>, <a href="/play.phtml?game_id=805">Fashion Fever</a>, and <a href="/play.phtml?game_id=683">Adver-video</a> give you Neopoints for clicking a single time. There's no reason not to do them. You'd get a minimum 

of 1,500 Neopoints to a maximum of 6,900 in about two minutes.

<font class="subh">What is restocking?</font> Restocking is, by definition, buying cheap items from official Neopian shops and reselling them in your shop to make a profit.<br><br><font class="subh">Is it a good way to make Neopoints?</font> Many people use it as their primary method. It can be very profitable, but it takes speed, skill, patience, and lots of luck. If you get very lucky, you could buy a rare item worth as much as millions. That is the pinnacle of expert restocking.<br><br><font class="subh">Can anyone do it?</font> Anyone has the ability to do it. However, if your account is new you will not be able to see all the items available in shops. At three months account age you can see all items.<br><br><font class="subh">Where do I do it?</font> If you are a beginner, I would suggest the book shop as a place to start. Intermediate players might try the chocolate and toy shops, while advanced restockers would try the coin, magic, or stamp shops. It is a personal preference where you try to restock. A majority of Neopian shops sell items that will always yield a profit when resold. However, not all shops are a good deal and you should try to have a basic knowledge of which items are worthless and bad deals to buy.<br><br><font class="subh">How do I know which items are good deals?</font> USUALLY a rare item stands out from others because of its price and number in stock. This is not always the case, but usually a 10,000 NP item among 500 NP items is rare and should be dived for. If an item's price is drastically different, or if there is only one in stock, it is most likely rare. For example, any book in the book shop worth 5,000-10,000 NP is almost sure to be a great deal.<br><br><font class="subh">How do I know which items are bad deals?</font> If you see items in a shop, look at the number in stock. If there is over 10 of an item in stock, chances are it is a common item and will not yield much profit if you buy it. If there is 20+ of an item in stock it is most likely a bad deal. However, bad items can sometimes stock in small numbers. If an item that only has 2 or 3 in stock stays in the shop for 10+ seconds after refreshing the page, it is most likely a bad deal and could have been sitting there all day. Examples include potions, battle items, and non-wearable clothing items. If something is very expensive and only has 1-3 in stock, but has been sitting for over 10 seconds, it will probably lose you a LOT of Neopoints if bought.<br><br><font class="subh">What if I buy an item that is a bad deal?</font> If you buy an item that is worth less than what you bought it for there is nothing you can do but learn from the mistake. You can still resell the item, you just won't make a profit.<br><br><font class="subh">How do I do it?</font> You simply click the item you want to buy. This brings up a screen to haggle. Type in a number close to what the shopkeeper wants, then click the pet to confirm your purchase. That is a very simplified explanation. My tutorial in the next step will explain better. Know, however, that you could be competing with as many as hundreds of people for the same item, so you need to be the fastest entering your numbers if you want to actually get an item.<br><br><font class="subh">So speed is the biggest factor?</font> Correct. Speed is key in restocking. Fast internet connection helps, but it's not the end of the game if you have a slower connection. You can still restock.<br><br><font class="subh">I keep going to shops but it says there's no items.</font> Shops restock randomly on an 8-minute timer. Every 8 minutes a shop gets new items. These items move FAST. Many shops will only have items stocked for about 30 seconds before they are sold out. So many people are competing for the same items that they are ripped off the shelves. If there are no items in a shop it means you missed the 8-minute restock and will have to wait for the next window to try and grab an item. So think about it this way: a shop will only have items for about 30 seconds, then it goes through a 7 minute 30 second period of having no items at all. You will have to be patient and keep refreshing at the shop constantly. <br><br></div>

<font class="subh">1. Choose your store, find an item.</font> For the purpose of this tutorial I am using the Tiki Tack Shop on Mystery Island. NEVER BUY FROM TIKI TACK. The items are a terrible value and most of them are really worth 1 NP. The only reason why I am using this terrible shop is because the items of such bad value that they are always in stock, and so I can easily take screenshots. A list of shops that are actually GOOD places to restock at can be found later on. Use your imagination and pretend that the bottle of green sand in my screenshot is a rare item that I am rushing to buy. If this were any other shop, you'd have to be much faster. Click on the item and a screen appears:

<br><br><center><img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/rstut2.gif" border="0"></center>
<br><br>
Just click OK or hit enter as fast as you can to be taken to the next "haggle" screen.

<br><br><font class="subh">2. Haggle; enter the price to pay for the item.</font> The next screen is called the "haggle" screen. This is where you type in the number of the price you want to pay for the item. When buying an item, notice that is already has a price before you click on it. That is just the shopkeeper's recommended base price. You can go slightly lower or higher. The shopkeeper wants 263 NP for the sand in my example. (What a bad deal!) You will see something like the screenshot here to the left.

<br><br><center><img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/rstut3.gif" border="0"></center> Click on the offer box as fast as you can. You need to type a number that is slightly lower than the base price, but that is mindlessly fast to type. No need to erase the zero, just click after it. Your goal is to go as fast as possible, not waste time haggling for a cheaper price. If you haggle too low or too high, the shopkeeper will reject your offer and bring you back to the haggling screen. Making a typo or going too high/low can lose you an item in a second, so it is important to be focused and know the ranges of haggles that will be accepted. Never go more than 100 NP off an item that has a base price lower than 1,000 NP. You can go slightly more off if the item is more expensive. It's based on percentages, so you could easily get 200 NP off an item that costs 4,000 NP, but not off an item that costs 300 NP. Since my bottle of sand costs 263 NP originally, I'm going to try for 233 NP. 233 is a very fast number to type since 2 is next to 3. The easiest way to haggle is to type the closest numbers together on the keyboard. Try combinations such as 222, 233, etc... anything fast to type that is close to the original price. 

<br><br><center>Depending on how fast you haggled, you will see one of these two screens:<br><br><img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/rstut4.gif" class="mainimg"><img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/rstut5.gif" class="mainimg"><br><br>
Congratulations! You may have just restocked your first item. As for me, I am now the new owner of a Bottle of Green Sand. </center>
<br><center><img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/rstut6.gif" border="0"></center>
<font class="subh">3. Sell your restocked item.</font> The whole point is to resell items in your shop to make a profit. Most items you buy will give you at least a small profit, depending on how rare they are. Go to your inventory, put the item in your shop, and then head over to the Shop Wizard. If you don't know about the Shop Wizard, you will need to use it to price items at a common average. To the left is a screenshot of the Shop Wizard. Type in your item name and select "Identical to my Phrase" from the dropdown menu. This is important! You can ignore pretty much everything else. Hit "search" to see your results. The Shop Wizard searches only one chunk of Neopian shops at a time, so you may have to search more than once to get the true price of an item. I like to search three or more times to price every item. 

<center><img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/rstut7.gif" border="0"></center> After a few searches for my "Bottle of Green Sand" sample, this is the result. The screenshot to the right shows the average prices for the sand. When pricing items, you want to be close to the average but beat it slightly. If I were to price the sand in my shop, I would ask for 10 NP based on the Shop Wizard's findings. Since I paid 233 NP for the sand, I lose 223 NP by reselling it for 10 NP. I lost Neopoints because my example was not a good item to restock, but most of the time the Shop Wizard price will be much greater than the shop price.

Hopefully after this walkthrough you are familiar with the process of buying, haggling, and pricing items. Restocking is a great way to make a profit if you know what you're doing. Good luck; you'll need it!

Keep your left hand on the number keys, probably around the lower end. Sit up straight and keep a good posture. It can help your reflexes.<br><br><font class="subh">Play some music in the background.</font> I like to play some music while restocking to set the mood and make me feel energized. It also helps calm me. Listening to music can help you focus and give you something to do that isn't distracting while refreshing.<br><br><font class="subh">Restock at multiple shops.</font> If you focus on refreshing only one shop you will be very bored. Have multiple tabs up with many shops and make your own pattern of refreshing them. It helps to pass time, plus you're more likely to catch a restock than if you're just staring at one shop. Have fun with it. You can have many tabs up, even 10-20 different shops if you want.<br><br><font class="subh">Know how much NP to carry.</font> Restocking is dangerous; you never know when you might get a Tax Beast or other NP loss event. Restocking requires carrying more Neopoints than usual, so be aware that you are always at risk for random events that take away a percentage. If you are doing basic restocking like books or foods, you shouldn't need more than 10,000 Neopoints or so out at one time. If you are restocking bigger items, however, like coins or potions, you will need to have many thousands out. Some battle shop items may even require over 200,000 NP to restock. Be careful.<br><br><font class="subh">Relax, refresh frequently.</font> If you are very intent on restocking something good, refresh the shop window every few seconds. You will have to be fast to catch the best deals, as they go instantly. If you catch a shop JUST as it stocks you have the best chance to get a rare item. Don't count on others to make mistakes or hesitate; people know which items are rare and will dive for them. Try your best to stay calm and relax. If you are panicy and anxious you have more of a chance to slip up and miss a good deal, as I have many times.<br><br><font class="subh">Click the shopkeeper to refresh instead of the button on the page.</font> It's faster than moving your mouse cursor off the item area to get to the browser's refresh button.<br><br><font class="subh">There is nothing you can do to be faster except practice.</font> No one can give you tips on how to be faster. Internet connection is a small factor, but your reaction times are much more important. All you can do is practice. Over time I notice that I click faster and memorize which items are better deals. You will have to learn how to haggle in under 3 seconds.<br><br><font class="subh">Have patience, set limits.</font> Restocking takes lots of practice, and you will have to be super-fast to get any rare items. Remember that it is a competition; many people are diving for the same item. Set healthy limits for yourself, such as a set time or Neopoint goal daily. It's easy to lose track of time and restock for hours straight. Neopets is just a game; have fun.

<font class="subh">What is sniping?</font><br>Sniping is using the <a href="/market.phtml?type=wizard">Shop Wizard</a> to buy 

items other players have mispriced. You then sell those items in your shop 

for the right price. It is a legitimate method and many use it as their main source.<br><br><font class="subh">What are the advantages to sniping to earn Neopoints?</font><br>Sniping can result in a very large profit. People misprice items constantly. You can even 

find items such as codestones and paint brushes at 1 NP! If you snipe 

good items the profit will be large.<br><br><font class="subh">What are the disadvantages to sniping to earn Neopoints?</font><br>Sniping is very chancey. Hundreds of players are constantly using the Shop Wizard, so 

even if you find a snipeable item there is no guarantee you will get it. 

Like restocking, the potential for profit is huge but it's way too dependent on luck.<br><br><font class="subh">How do I snipe?</font><br>For a more detailed guide, check out <a href="/~Tulio_1000">this petpage</a>.

<font class="subh">What is the stock market? How is it a way to make Neopoints?</font><br><a href="/stockmarket.phtml">The stock 

market</a> on Neopets mirrors the stock market in real life. You spend 

Neopoints to buy "shares" of fictional companies. You buy the shares in bulk when they are low in price. For example, if you buy 1,000 shares at 15 Neopoints apiece you will have 

spent 15,000 Neopoints. Then you wait. Shares randomly go up and 

down in price as the days go on. Unlike the real life stock market, Neopets shares are completely random and do not depend on the number of people buying them. To profit from the 

stock market you buy shares at 15NP and wait for them to go up. You 

sell the shares when they increase to 30-100 NP per share.<br><br><font class="subh">What are the advantages to using stocks to earn Neopoints?</font><br>Stocks take time, but if you are patient they result in a great payout. Stocks is a 

method that needs to be paired with games. Instead of banking the 

Neopoints you win from games you put them in the stock market. <br><br><font class="subh">What are the disadvantages to using stocks to earn Neopoints?</font><br>The stock market is the ultimate waiting game. It could take as long as 6 months 

for stocks to go up and result in a profit. Profits are huge (If you invest 

15,000 and wait long enough it will turn into 100,000) but take months to amass. Plus in order to use the stocks you must invest a large amount of Neopoints. For your stocks to 

be worth all the trouble you would have to have an existing 100,000+ to 

invest.<br><br><font class="subh">What are some strategies and tips for buying stocks?</font><br><a href="/~Kuraddo">This petpage</a> offers some great information for

r101+ items may be junk in disguise.<br><br><font class="subh">What's the deal with r101 items?</font><br>r101 does not mean rare. It means it does not come from shops. r101 items CAN be rare, but many are not. For 

example, a <i>Rotten Omelette</i> is r101 but only costs 1 Neopoint. 

Rotten Omelettes are very commonly generated from the <a href="/prehistoric/omelette.phtml">Giant Omelette</a>. <br><br><font class="subh">What's the deal with r111+ items?</font><br>Many items in the r111+ category come from real life Neopets merchandise. When you buy a plushie or trading 

card pack you get a code to enter that gives you a virtual item. These 

items are usually very rare but completely useless. For example, <i>Aisha Compact Mirror</i> is rarity 130 but is just a normal grooming item. <br><br><font class="subh">What's the deal with r180+ items?</font><br>Anything that is r180 is retired, meaning that it is not sold in shops and no new instances of that item will ever 

be generated. These items, depending on the demand for them, vary in 

price. For example, toys that were given away to every player last December are retired but are only valued at a few hundred Neopoints. The toys can be used infinitely and are in 

low demand, so even though they are retired the price stays low. A 

<i>Faerie Paint Brush</i>, another retired item, is just the opposite. Many people want it and the brush is a one use item. The price increases rapidly and is always worth over 3 

million Neopoints.<br><br><font class="subh">Are all r200 items valuable?</font><br>Yes. Anything with a rarity of 200 is almost guaranteed to be expensive. Perhaps the one exception is 

<i>Squeaky Tombola Guy</i>, an unpopular toy item. ALL rarity 200 items 

come exclusively from the <a href="#ht">Hidden Tower</a>.

<font class="subh">If I have an item I want to sell, how do I sell it?</font><br>So many newbies need to know this. If you come across an item, it should 

be sold in your <a href="/market.phtml?type=your">shop</a> 99% of the time. If your item is worth under 100,000 Neopoints, DO NOT use the Trading Post. 

You will get a better deal selling in shops. The Trading Post is only for rarer items and people will not want to bid on common 

items they could find in another user's shop more easily.<br><br><font class="subh">How do I create/set up a shop?</font><br>It's very simple. Click <a href="/market.phtml?type=your">here</a> and you should be prompted 

to do it. It costs 200NP and your new shop will be able to hold 5 items 

for sale. You can make it hold more later on, but now that should be fine.  Once you have a shop set up, go to your inventory and select "put into your shop" from an item 

popup.<br><br><font class="subh">How do I price my item? Should I go by the estimated values on inventory popups?</font><br>NO. NEVER, EVER, EVER trust the values on item popups or 

site searches. Those are very rough and are wrong 99% of the time. To 

get the real value of an item you must use the <a href="/market.phtml?type=wizard">Shop Wizard</a> to compare prices with other people selling that item.  

<br><br><font class="subh">How do I use the Shop Wizard?</font><br>Simply copy and paste your item name into the search box. Be sure to select "identical to my phrase" from the 

dropdown menu before searching for anything! The Shop Wizard gives you a 

list of shops selling an item. You should base your price off the prices listed if you want to sell your item. You may need to do more than one Shop Wizard search to find an accurate 

price. The Shop Wizard only shows a few shop names at a time, so the 

more searches you do, the more accurate your price will be.  <br><br><font class="subh">What if the Shop Wizard cannot find my item?</font><br>If you do three or four Shop Wizard searches and your item is not found, congratulations! That means 

your item is worth over 100,000 Neopoints and must be sold on the 

Trading Post. Read my <a href="#tradingpost">section on the Trading post</a> if you want to hear more.

the Shop Wizard work?</font><br>The Shop Wizard searches shops in Neopia 

based on the first letter of their username. Since there are hundreds of shops selling the same item and only a few appear on each search, you need to do more than one search to 

accurately price an item. Names are grouped together in clusters of two 

to three letters and numbers: A N 0, B O 1, C P 2, D Q 3, E R 4, F S 5, G T 6, H U 7, I V 8, J W 9, K X _, L Y, and M Z. So for example, if your username started with an F, your shop 

would show up in the same group as someone who had a username 

stating with F, S, or 5.<br><br><font class="subh">Why use the Shop Wizard? Why can't I price my items at whatever I want?</font><br>You have the right to charge whatever you want for your items, but if you 

don't price according to the shop wizard, they will not get sold. The 

Shop Wizard is a valuable tool that provides average pricing to regulate items. It is FREE advertising for your shop. As long as you have the cheapest price on the Shop Wizard your 

name will appear at the top of searches. <br><br><font class="subh">Is there a limit to the Shop Wizard?</font><br>The Shop Wizard is a large database, so using it too much could stress Neopets' servers. Searches are limited. 

If you do too many in a certain time you will be banned from searching 

for 10 to 60 minutes.<br><br><font class="subh">What is the difference between the Shop Wizard and Super Shop Wizard?</font><br>The Shop Wizard is a free service available to everyone. You can do many 

searches and you only get a clump of usernames with varied prices with 

each search. The Super Shop Wizard, on the other hand, is a paid feature of <a href="#premium">Neopets Premium</a>. You get a very limited number of Super Shop Wizard 

searches daily, but they will return the absolute cheapest prices in all of 

Neopia on the first search. This way you don't waste time pricing items and can often snipe cheap items easily.

the Trading Post work?</font><br>The <a href="/island/tradingpost.phtml">Trading Post</a> is where users trade items for other items. This is the intended 

purpose, but most people use the post to purchase items, such as medium rarity paint brushes, that cost between 100,000 and 800,000 Neopoints. 

You can offer 10 items and/or 800,000 Neopoints on any trading lot, but that is the limit. Any items that cost from 100,000 to 800,000 Neopoints should be sold here. Anything 

cheaper should be sold with the Shop Wizard and anything more 

expensive should be sold through <a href="#auctionhouse">auctions</a>.<br><br><font class="subh">What items should be sold on the Trading Post?</font><br>You should always use the Shop Wizard above everything else. If you search for an item and it is 

not on the Shop Wizard, THEN check the Trading Post. You should 

always sell paint brushes and morphing potions on the Trading Post. Expensive battle weapons and map pieces are also belong there. <br><br><font class="subh">What items should NOT be sold on the Trading Post?</font><br>Anything worth under 100,000 Neopoints should be sold in a shop. Codestones, dubloons, 

bottled faeries, books, and other semi-rare items all belong in shops. 

Never put junk items on the Trading Post.<br><br><font class="subh">What do I put as my wishlist for a trade?</font><br>If you want to sell an item on the post, search for that item first. Check the prices of the competition and 

then go a bit lower. Always try to get pure Neopoints. Make it clear in 

your wishlist that you want X amount of Neopoints and you won't budge.<br><br><font class="subh">What if someone offers junk items or a morphing potion on my trade?</font><br>If someone offers items that are obviously junk, reject them. This is very rude 

behavior, especially if the person has an established wishlist. If 

someone offers a morphing potion or other rare item without any pure Neopoints, be careful and do not accept. Look up the item. It is most likely hard to sell, meaning it is rare but 

useless and hard to get rid of.<br><br><font class="subh">What do the acronyms in trade lots stand for?</font><br><b>K</b> means 1,000 Neopoints. <b>M</b> means 1,000,000 Neopoints. <b>ETS</b> means easy to sell. <b>HTS</b> means hard to sell. (See my <a href="#ets">ETS/HTS 

section</a>.) <b>Pure</b> means the person only wants Neopoints 

and no items. <b>OBO</b> stands for "or best offer."

<br><div class="minternal">
<font class="subh">What is Easy to Sell?</font><br>Easy to Sell, or ETS, refers to any item that is popular and in high demand. These items are often 

rare and desired by many people. They will sell very quickly and for a high 

or set price.<br><br><font class="subh">What is Hard to Sell?</font><br>Hard to Sell, or HTS, refers to any item that is very rare and expensive but at the same time useless or unwanted. These 

items are difficult to get rid of. If you are selling a HTS item you will most 

likely have to mark it down a lot before you can pass it on to someone else. Usually the only people who buy HTS items are those who make profits off the challenge of reselling HTS 

items and gallery owners who collect very specific or obscure 

items.<br><br><font class="subh">What do you do to sell an ETS item?</font><br>ETS items should be priced very closely to Shop Wizard and Trading Post prices. Search for your item and look 

at the competitors. Depending on the price of the item, don't go too far 

below. For example, if you are selling a paint brush you should only go a few thousand away from the average price. If the average price is 600,000 and you sell yours for 595,000 

you should sell quickly since paint brushes are very ETS. <br><br><font class="subh">What do you do to sell an HTS item?</font><br>You will need lots of patience. Always check the competition's prices first. Often if an item is HTS the prices 

will be all over the place. With HTS items you need to drastically beat 

the lowest price. To use the same example, if an item is HTS and the competitors want 700,000, 640,000, and 600,000, try going to 580,000 and waiting. If the item does not get 

any offers within a day or two, drop by increments as high as several 

thousand and work your way down. If you still get no offers by the time it reaches 530,000 or so, the last resort is the <a href="/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=6">trades board</a>. People there will buy HTS items for severely 

discounted prices in hopes of reselling them to make a profit for themselves. The optimal situation for a HTS item is finding a gallery owner that wants to collect related items. 

Gallery owners will pay more than resellers, often close to the average 

price.<br><br><font class="subh">What are examples of...</font><br><center><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>

<img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/newbieguide/side-zdap.jpg" border="0" class="left"><br>This is done all the time and is called avatar lending. 

However, be aware that to be lent an item you should have full collateral. Collateral 

is items or Neopoints equal to the value of the item. Collateral is given to ensure people don't steal lent items. Usually you will give the lender collateral (which is usually well over 

a million for most avatar items) through the trading post. You then 


receive the item, get the avatar, and trade back. Never lend without full collateral! It is dangerous and you risk losing your item. You should never ask to be lent without full 

collateral either; it is usually considered rude. Lenders are doing a good deed 

by lending their expensive item out so others can get avatars, so always be polite and follow their rules.</div>

Here are guides to tell you the prices of <a href="/~Kudonic">morphing potions</a> and <a href="/~laonei">paintbrushes</a>.<br><br><img src="http://i727.photobucket.com/albums/ww273/jubbyjubjack/newbieguide/side-lennypot.jpg" border="0" class="left"><font class="subh">What are the cheapest morphing 

potions?</font><br><i>Green Ogrin Morphing Potion</i>, <i>Red Ogrin Morphing Potion</i>, <i>Blue Ogrin Morphing Potion</i>, and <i>Yellow Ogrin Morphing Potion</i> are the cheapest at 5,000.  <i>Green Uni Morphing Potion</i> is probably the next cheapest, 

around 20,000 NP. <i>Split Lenny Morphing Potion</i> and <i>Brown Moehog Morphing Potion</i> are also cheap. You get an avatar from using any morphing or 

transmogrification potion on your pet, so if you want that, use one of those.

Neopoints to buy, so if you use one you risk losing big. You get an avatar 

when you use a Nerkmid in the machine. Unless you are very into avatar collecting, I would recommend selling a Nerkmid if you get one.
