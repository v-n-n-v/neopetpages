<br><i>Chills</i> started running up my spine and to the tips of my claws. My paws gripped to my desk for dear life, moments ago I felt fine. My blooding rushing in my ears on rhythm like a heartbeat, repeating over and over again. My fur, on end, feels like its getting pulled out by each individual hair in different directions. I could feel my breath getting raspy as I struggle to take air in, it felt like inhaling sand. <b>So much for the book I was reading.</b> The pages in my view quickly went out of focus, my one good eye starting to tear up.<br>

I jump from my wooden desk chair and and hobble across the room, I'm barely able to pick my feet up. Even walking was getting more difficult by the second. Grabbing a vial from my shelves, I pop the cork off and disgustingly look into the mouth of the bottle. Grudgingly I dump the deep purple liquid over my head. I lay down on the cool stone, too late to move I wait for the vision to take over and brace for impact. My eyesight faded as I felt the nothingness of blacking out take over...<p>

</p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ssNKNni.png" border="1"></center><p>

My eyes finally opened, could have been seconds, minutes or hours later. I lay on the same stone floor, its cool on my thin coat. The bright light coming in through the window of the castle pierces my head with the onset of a migraine. Nauseous I try to sit up, but to gently let myself down to wait for the sickness to pass. I took the time to blink the sleepiness out of my eye. My heart is beating a thousand times a minute, start taking note of my breathing I could feel the beats begin to slow.</p><p>

 Barely a foot from where I lay a small blue orb danced mere inches off the ground, as if it were weightless. Ignoring it for a moment I noticed how sand papery my mouth was. <b>Boy that really was an episode.</b> I said to myself quietly.<br>

I stretched my shaky paw out to catch the orb, my heart finally starting to return to normal. The orb is a little warm and soothing after how chilling the stone floor was. My paw gently guided it back into the original vial I dumped on my head. With the orb safely stashed I willed myself to sit up again. I shook my head to get the grogginess out, it felt like I had just woken mid-fever. I squinted my good eye to avoid the light as much as possible.</p><p>

Looking into the bottle with a tinge of sadness I thought of those who could be effected by the orb in my paws. <b>Good its recorded.</b> I whispered to myself, grateful that the purple vials worked. They double as a pain reliever and store a little magic of recording memories. What I do is an important job, something you can't learn to do but must be born into. Another tear escaped my good eye and dropped on to the side of the bottle. Though what I'm doing is very important for the future of our people, these orbs are often filled with a string of deaths. I need to deliver it, but first I need to listen to the cursed thing. </p><p>

<i>To keep this short,</i> I am a myuti, species fralir. When the Earth was created five species were added to Earth that are just as, if not more intelligent than humans: Rakir (dragon), Panir (canine), Fralir (feline), Celtir (bovine/hooved) and Telkir (aves/winged). We were given the task to protect humans, the human creator and leader of the angels selected five angels make their own pets. We kind of overran the heavens, so we were placed on Earth with the humans but that was many generations ago.<br></div></center>

<p>
<br><i>Munchkin's</i> are born incredibly small, they may be wanted as a humans pet but as a myuti we are somewhat mocked for being so short. I am as capable and smart as any fralir!  Due to my size I was seldom called upon by my peers, for being fragile. Not that was treated poorly, but I was treated as a kitten and babies all my life. Working was prohibited, starting a family was impossible, even attempting to learn magic got me scolded by family.</p><p>

When I was younger I spent most of my time watching what the adults did but I was not allowed to participate but everything changed when it was found I was given an inner eye. The only reason we found out was because the magic inside of me tried to burst out of me because my body was too small. A myuti's magic is kept in their aura which is in our irises. So if you ever see a myuti, our eyes typically don't match our pelts. Anyways, light blue is typically wind or water magic. But in rare cases it can be for divination.</p><p>

</p><center>________________________________<p></p></center>

<i>About ten years ago...</i><p>

That day I thought I was just having a migraine, I was prone to them after all. I was alone at home while my family was out, suddenly my magic went wild. I was engulfed in a bright blue hue, like mist covering my whole person. Every fiber in my body in agony, I screamed and hit the floor, even the softness of carpet felt like belt sanders on my skin. I couldn't tell if any sound was leaving my lungs because of the sound of rushing wind in my ears. My vision went blurred and I couldn't even close my mouth. The musscles in my body had gone into spasms. Luckily the right <a href="//www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=Dedeck">passerby</a> heard my cries and brought in help, just as I saw the bright blue eyes of a concerned lioness my eyesight went out. </p><p>

It felt like an eternity in my own nightmare, but eventually I came to and was greeted with bright magenta eyes. They came from a young and small grey face. Even with the sparkle from those beautiful deep rose eyes you could see a sheen almost a veil something only attained with great experience and wisdom. It was a fralir, a little bigger than I, with large blue-hued raven wings it stared into my eyes and mumbled to the passerby, a large lioness was holding out stitching wire towards the grey cat who kept nodding back in agreement.</p><p>

</p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hEP1xqo.png" border="1"></center><p>

My body felt like it was made of lead, I couldn't move. Compared to the pain before this was nothing, my entire body felt bruised and my left eye felt like it was burning but better than before. I groaned trying to at least move my ears. The grey cat whispered quietly, <b>Don't move, I'm fixing you up, ok?</b> I felt a gentle touch of a paw pad on the ear I was trying to move, signifying me to stay put.<br>

I managed to squeeze out a small whine, <b>Where am I?</b>

The grey cat slowly came into full focus when I heard the snip of scissors she said, <b>Same place you fell. Your left eye burst with uncontrollable magic, I couldn't save it. But its ok, I saved your aura magic and sewed it into your eye.</b> They pulled back with a small needle in hand and carefully passed it to the lioness who tucked it into a small first aid kit. The one my family kept in the kitchen.</p><p><b> Wait. What?</b> My voice becoming less groggy and my brain fog clearing. The pain in my body becoming more apparent.</p><p>
The grey cat sighed as they saw me stand up. <b>So you're a little short, huh? Must be why your magic tried to burst out. Like a overflowing cup you body just couldn't handle it.</b> The raven cat stood and looked down on me, only a few inches difference in size, small smile on its lip. <b> Where is your family?</b></p><p>
I sat back down and slowly reached to my left eye and hissed, it really was sewn shut. I felt like my family wouldn't want to keep me if I'd stay accident prone like this.</p><p>

 I looked the winged cat and the silent lioness over then hung my head dejectedly. <b>Working, probably. I don't know, I am stuck here as a trophy or a pet to them.</b></p><p>

The lioness sighed, sympathetically closing her eyes to think. After a moment she cleared her throat, <b>REACHING FOR THE FOOT OF A DEITY, THE ELDEST WILL BURN BY ITS OWN BLOOD.</b> Sighing again the lioness gave me a soft smile. <b>That, my little friend is called a prophecy. You were born with the gift of divination, and judging by what it just did to you. Its strong.</b> She looked over to the grey cat. <b>Luna, if shes stuck, lets take her with us. She needs us and with her talent she would be an asset.</b></p><p>

The grey cat gave the lioness a big smile, fangs shining white. <b>I'm glad we think so much alike,</b> Lune turned to me,<b> say uh, whats your name?</b> Gesturing to me.</p><p>

<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HSMAN8S.png" width="40%" style="border: 1px solid #884015; float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><b>Miss Jane, but you can call me Missy, its what my family calls me,</b> my eye widened a little mildly shocked, heart picking up. These strangers want to kidnap me?<br><b>Nice to meet you Missy. My name is Luna,</b> She stood as tall and should could letting her magenta aura cover her body,<b> if you know our history my full name is Lunar Blossom daughter of Fralir and my quiet friend here is my bodyguard Dedeck.</b> Luna pointed at the lioness then nodded her head towards me.</p><p>

By then my eyes were the size of dinner plates. <b>The Luna? The first born fralir?</b> This Luna was so small, no way she could be the first born.</p><p>

Both the other cats nodded. Luna laughed and spread her wings. <b>Well Missy, you're welcome to come with us. We won't force you. I promise you food, room and board with us. I travel often, hence how I met you today. But you'll have a tough job. I expect you to study your magic and learn to control it.</b> She ended her speech by standing and walking towards the door where Dedeck already sat waiting to leave. These two just happened to hear me, saved my life and saved my magic...</p><p>

<i>I pondered a moment, but how could I say no?</i>

<i>Magic Uses</i> <br>
When Missy isn't recovering from a recent prophecy prediction she usually cooped up and trying to learn how to channel her divination magic. Great skiIIed divination mages of the past used tea cup readings, a crystal ball, hand lines and many other ways to channel it. She has decided she wanted to learn using a crystal ball. How the magic works is that if she can get the surge of magical power from a trance to leave her paws into the ball then the vision will appear inside.<br> The only downside is that she finds the magic gets stuck in her head, like a migraine and it just won't travel down her legs into the ball.<br>
So far she can control the magic fairly well outside of prophecy prediction. She can spy on people by picturing them and touching the ball. She can also focus on her enemies and make small blue explosions, but she only has one eye so her depth perception isn't very good.</p><p>


<i>Personality</i><br>
Because of Missy's upbringing shes always been a little spoiled but she is used to being told no. She's just never worked a day in her life before moving in with Luna. So learning to have a work ethic took quite some time. Others would describe her as a bit of a child, fun loving, curious, hungry for knowledge but if upset she can be pretty snippy and hold grudges.

















<br><br><a name="Inspiration"></a></p><center><h1>who?</h1></center>

<i>There</i> is nothing original in any character anymore. My character inspiration came from two main factors of my owners life. Night has owned me for many years and this is finally that character I received. In May of 2022 Night started rewatching Harry Potter with her nephew because he started reading the books. <p>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/oFgo5y7.gif" style="float: right; width: 220px; border: 1px solid #884015; margin-left: 15px;">
Night found that Professor Trelawney was one colorful character. She tried her best to use the divination magic they were born with but it never really works out unless they're in a trance that they don't remember afterwards. Kind of silly in a character but entertaining none the less. On top of that Professor Trelawney's clothes were just so random, hippy and fun looking. Kinda of like a patchwork sock monkey type thing. (Night owns a pair of parachute pants that remind her of my coloring.) So Night didn't copy this Professor but just found them to be a great inspiration for me.</p><p>

The other main inspiration (other than Night's pants) was her cat Ninja. Ninja was born like a grey siamese, but she was born with a snow white face and three snow white legs. As Ninja has gotten older her back turned grey and her face started to too! Not only that, but her mother was calico so Ninja has been turning more calico too as she gets older. Her vet says her color could be described as a Lynx-point Siamese Calico. Her nose is bright pink with bright blue eyes. Night says shes the most unique cat color shes ever seen, pretty cool considering Ninja was pulled out of a wood pile at a few days old. <br>
Anyways Ninja's unique coloring really inspired Night to make my design funky!</p><p>

<a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=LunarBlossom">Luna:</a> In our history as myuti we all know the tale, its like the story of Adam and Eve but less human. The angel named Fralir created her in the heavens, he was one of the angels the human god selected to make a species. Once the heavens were filled with myuti and the human god said that was enough, she was one of the first on board with coming down to Earth. She knew it was in the best interest of the myuti to leave otherwise face the wrath of the leader. Still she never wanted to leave.<br>

I live with Luna in her castle. Its a quiet place, I work under her to make the world a better place. She isn't here twenty four seven but she does stop by often, she checks on my health and asks about new prophecies. Sometimes she directly summons for me in the throne room. But When it happens she needs me for an adventure, be it for tracking a missing person or if its delicate political meetings or she just wants me nearby.

<a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Dedeck">Dedeck:</a>

Dedeck is someone I have always known to be close to Luna. How long they've been partnered together, I have no idea. Dedeck rarely leaves Luna's side but I guess thats what a bodyguard is after all. When we first met she hardly ever spoke and now she is a total chatterbox! Since moving in with them they added a <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Luchairt">male lion</a> to their bodyguard team.</p><p>
Dedeck has always been sweet and charming to me, but I think its because she wanted Luna to be around more small fralir like her. Dedeck really wants nothing more than to take care of her queen. With me Dedeck and I are casual, we talk about dreams and goals. She often is my nurse after a prophecy hits me in a face. For someone so large she really does have a mothers touch. Our friendship is unique and I wouldn't trade it for the world. </p><p><br></p><div class="frend" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; margin-bottom: 40px;"><p>

<a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=Xevia">Xevia:</a> When I was growing up a lot of kits would prevent me from playing or ask me to go play with younger kits because of my size. Xev never hesitated with me and we would roughhouse as kids. Yeah sometimes she bit too hard or swatted me with her long legs but it was fine, at least she was willing to look passed my short legs.<p>
Because of our relationship, when I suddenly disappeared from home to live with Luna (I didn't tell anyone), she went our searching and prayed to the gods every night. Luna heard her prayer and brought Xev to the castle to meet with me. Tears were shed but she respects my choice in leaving because I would finally live the exciting life I always craved.</p>

<center>This is a continuation of the Introduction.</center></div><br><br><br><div style="width: 90%; background-color: #99d0f8; border: 5px dotted #e07a5f; overflow: auto; height: 400px; padding: 20px; text-align: justify; color: #204d7e;">

I decided to sit back for a few minutes to let the aches of creating the prophecy fade away. My heart was back to resting rate, and my paws were no longer shaky. I took a look around to make sure there was no damage. The table I was originally sitting at looked fine, but it looks like my claws had ripped a few pages of the book I was reading. <b>Hopefully it was only the part I read.</b> I sighed setting the vial down and picked up the book to put away. Turning away from the table, I nearly fell flat on my face as I had bunched up my rug and just nearly tripped on it. Finally got the book on the shelf and then I fixed my rug. Looking around my bed, window, crystal ball and apothecary equipment it looks like nothing else was out of place. I brought my attention back to the vial, I sat back on my chair where the book was and prepared to open the bottle. I had paper and a quill nearby ready to write with. <br>
Holding my breath, praying it wouldn't be bad I popped the cork off the vial. An ominous whisper released from its top:<p>

<i>Once the blizzard and the fiery ruby ally, a descendant is revealed as the raven's regent.</i></p><p>


</p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EzkarnU.png" border="1"></center><p>

I scratched down what the prophecy said then quickly capped the vial, sighing in relief because this prophecy finally didn't sound dangerous. Who could a blizzard and a fiery ruby be? Who the raven could be, and why they would need a regent. Standing from my chair, I slowly walked the memory in the bottle to my collection, setting on the shelf with dozens of others. Walking back to my desk I froze in thought. A regent is typically a descendant, which means the raven is royalty. My prophecies only apply to myuti and the telkir (bird) royal isn't a raven or even dark. The panir (wolf) royal passed years ago, the rakir (dragon) has angel wings and the celtir (horse) doesn't have wings. That means the raven is... Luna.<br>
I ran to the table, bit the paper I wrote on and took off down the hallway as fast as my stubby legs could take me.</p><p>

My ears bounced on my head as I went, passing door after door. The hallways of the old castle were damp and musty, the air was thick. No rest needed, this prophecy was so exciting. I took a corner without a rug and bumped into the wall at the throne room doors. Just in case if there was a guest there I figured I would be quiet. I slowly unlocked the side door with a tiny click. The door creaked slightly as I sneaked in. </p><p>

I can't see whos in the throne from behind but there was no sound, no no guests. I puffed and straightened my ears, ready to greet royalty. But before I could even move towards the throne I heard a sudden, <b>Missy, what's going on?</b> from Dedeck, a bright golden lioness with dark undertones, who was peeking from the front of the throne.</p><p>

</p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ALLutTt.png" border="1"></center><p>


I jumped with surprise but corrected myself, I briskly walked to the front of the throne, <b>Uh. I just w-wanted to deliver some news. Some IMPORTANT news!</b> I stumbled over my words.</p><p>

 Luna's gaze on me, she was a beautiful near-black long-hair british shorthair with silver spots, silver-blue undertone and the large black wings of a raven. She smiled at me, <b> Alright, and what might this news be?</b> The look was almost motherly.</p><p>

Dedeck chuckled as she made her way back to Luna's left side guard post. <b> What do you have for us?</b></p><p>

I started sweating a little. I was never good at these deliveries. I held the paper above my head like a torch. <b>This. T-this is what I have...</b> I gave my head a quick shake trying to regain reason. These are my friends, no reason to be scared. <b>Its a new prophecy! A positive one...</b> I pause, unsure of my next few words. <b> I think. In fact I think it has something to do with you Luna.</b></p><p>

Luchairt, a golden lion with light undertones and thick dark brown mane with spots, looked bored this entire interaction on Luna's right side finally perked up a little at this information by taking a quick glance at me. Dedeck herself was a little taken aback and looked at Luna for her reaction.</p><p>

</p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2SynTog.png" border="1"></center><p>

Luna furrowed her brow a little, looking between her two bodyguards and then back to me, <b>Read it to us.<b> All fondness had left her voice, only left with business.</b></b></p><p>



 I puffed out my chest trying to sound as monotone as possible. I read them the prophecy and my theories with it. Once the formalities are over, speaking in the court was natural. I talked about the myuti, how it couldn't be for the other myuti royalty, it has to be Luna. Luna took the information and waited for me to complete my speech.</p><p>

<b>Once the blizzard and the fiery ruby ally, a descendant is revealed as the raven's regent.</b></p><p>

Keeping the tone serious Luna says, <b>I had been thinking of finding a regent. I don't spend much time here anymore, but still many of our people come here requesting help or blessings. Many years ago my plan was to give that role to Dedeck, but even with her lineage she has no interest in ruling.</b> Luna glanced at Dedeck who had no reaction to the statement. Continuing Luna looked up into the skylight. <b>But regents are meant to be related by blood, right? I have not had children in many generations, at this point I cannot track my own bloodlines, much less whoever a blizzard and fiery ruby are.</b> Luna placed her face in her paws with an exasperated groan. <b>I mean, I consider all of you my children.</b></p><p>

It was normal for us to brainstorm for a few minutes on the prophecy before we proceed, but having it relate to someone in the room was new. Never had Luna looked so frustrated about a subject. Luchairt cleared his throat, we all turned our eyes to him. He looks at me and over to Luna. <b>My lady, if anything this could be a blessing. A prophecy has picked a regent for you, that means there is someone perfect for the position. We just need to locate them.</b> Rather than waiting for a reaction, he turned stone face and took his guard post again. Stoic as always.</p><p>

Luna rubbed her eyes for a moment, still looking stressed. <b>Its not that I don't want this regent. I am concerned since its a prophecy it might not be a good thing. This could be a huge threat, the prophecy said there will be a regent but never said they would be successful. This regent could be a monster.</b></p><p>

</p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bxRkahd.png" border="1"></center><p>

Dedeck smiled over at Luchairt for sending the positive vibes. She then squared her shoulders to speak to Luna as a friend and not a guard. <b>Luna, Missy has got us started. But if we are to find this legendary ravens regent then we need to get looking, first lets get the twins in on this mission then we will look ourselves. If it turns out to be a bad thing, then its too late-its been prophesied.</b> Luna nodded, and waved her paw to dismiss Dedeck.<br>
Dedeck bowed out and left the front door with her golden fur shining against the sun, the door closing behind her. The twins?</p><p>

I take my gaze from the door back to Luna and wait for my next instruction as my job was done. She seems to have relaxed since Dedeck said it would be fine.</p><p> 

The black cat was lost in thought, staring at the door still. She closes her eyes, scrunches her nose and forces a sigh instantly relaxing, must be from a millennia of practice. She looks at me with her motherly gaze back on and gently waves her paw on my direction signalling me to leave. I square my shoulders, and quickly trot out of her throne room and back to my own room.</p><p>

</p></div>

<br><br><br><br><div style="width: 90%; background-color: #99d0f8; border: 5px dotted #e07a5f; overflow: auto; height: 400px; padding: 20px; text-align: justify; color: #204d7e;">
Days later I was back to reading that torn up book. Luckily I had not ruined any parts I haven't read. I had been sitting at my desk most of the day. Leaning on the table with my face in my paw, just reading.<p>

 Suddenly there was a knock at my door, I heard the deep booming voice of Luchairt but couldn't make up what he was saying. Bouncing off my chair I opened my door to the large lion looking down on me. He quickly crouched to my height at the sight of me, he nodded a greeting to me and said, <b>The twins have arrived. Luna would like your presence.</b> The twins. He then stood up and started walking back to the throne room. I shut the door behind me and quickly followed suit.</p><p>

-------------------------</p><p>

Luchairt guided me to the side of the throne room with a few other influential guests. We all sat in a line on either side of the room so we could see Luna on her throne. Luchairt took his place on Lunas right, and Dedeck was already in position at her left. The room was filled with hushed whispers from the guests but once Luch took his place the room fell silent. I was already uncomfortable, but this silence was deafening.</p><p>

Luna cleared her throat, despite the distance we could hear her clearly, <b>Bring them in.</b></p><p>

</p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UAo3U05.png" border="1"></center><p>

The main doors to the throne room swung open and there stood two cheetahs, one nearly black with the darkest spots I had ever seen, barely visible, with bright pink eyes and massive black raven wings like Luna. The other was gold with dark brown spots and stripes like a race car with pale golden eyes. The crowd and body guards bowed slightly towards the to cheetahs so I copied them. The new cats strutted in as if they had no idea was etiquette was, they held their heads high and jogged up to the foot of Luna's pedestal. Stopping just before the stairs they both sat down and dropped their heads just for a moment. The darker cheetah introduced himself as Bolzar and the lighter cheetah as Trapandor. The lighter cheetah started with the questions, <b>Luna, you summoned us to locate someone what information can you offer?</b></p><p>

Luna nodded back to them. <b>We were given a prophecy, so its not exact and we are playing off of riddles. This is it word for word.</b> Luna pulled a piece of paper from the small table next to her throne and began to read. <b>Once the blizzard and the fiery ruby ally, a descendant is revealed as the raven's regent. We have deducted that I am likely the raven as I am the only raven-winged royal among myuti. However I am at a loss of my bloodlines, it has been so long since I have had my own children I cannot imagine where their great-great grandchildren might be. I spoke with my trustees.</b> She gestured grandly at the guests around the room, me included. <b> I am counting on you two to investigate.</b> She sighs at the end of her speech and leans back, waiting for a response.</p><p>

The boys look at each other a moment then back to Luna.  <b>The blizzard? The fiery ruby? These aren't exactly direct descriptions.</b> Bolzar mentioned, puzzled.</p><p>

</p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/D5LGAaw.png" border="1"></center><p>

Luna nodded to them again, letting their brains whir a moment. <b>You're right. My trustees suggest that there are two lineages of fralir out there, one of light features known for wearing their aura as a third eye.</b></p><p>

<b>The ruby.</b> Bolzar the dark one muttered quietly, still thinking it over. He leaned over to Trapandor and whispered in his ear.</p><p>

Both of them stopped for a moment, letting their brains go into overdrive. Bolzar cleared his throat with an announcement for the entire room, <b>We do know of a few fralir located in India that do match that description, we will look into this and see if we can gather information. Theres a chance that there was a recent wedding we could look into and see if theres a fralir that looks like a blizzard.</b></p><p>

The crowd clapped for a moment then went back to whispering about the new info. Luna raised her paw and closed it, silencing the room again. <b>Alright, we are off to a good start. I expect regular updates and a detailed report.</b> She waved her paw at the boys who ran out of the room with dismissal. After the rest of the crowd was allowed to leave.</p><p>

I wonder what the twins will uncover in India? Is the regent there? Is it a hoax? I really cannot figure it out.



</p></div>


<br><br><br><br><div style="width: 90%; background-color: #99d0f8; border: 5px dotted #e07a5f; overflow: auto; height: 400px; padding: 20px; text-align: justify; color: #204d7e;">

Months later I was in the court yard playing with a kitten. His name was Iri, son of a panir named Silzera. By law he was required to visit us and learn about fralir life because he literally lived among wolves. He was only 13 and already four times my size. Still we enjoyed wrestling and playing in the gardens with other people working in the castle. His mother, Silzera, would go inside and spend time with Luna likely business talk as they were both leaders of their species.<p>

After playing hard for hours today the rest of the castle staff went back to work. Iri and I took a break laying in the grass watching clouds. I look over at him, <b>So what have you been up to since your last visit? I heard your mom mention that the pack has been moving a lot lately.</b></p><p>

He shrugs his shoulders and glances at me for a moment. <b>Yeah its been pretty cool, recently, we moved from north Russia because the winters are so rough, we walked all the way down to Mongolia for the winter. Its a nice place, lots of myuti appeared on our trip too.</b></p><p>

Curious I asked, <b>So do myuti join you guys on your trip like a great migration?</b></p><p>
He sits up to look right at me, tail wagging like a dog. <b>Yeah! I met this fralir, hes only a bit older than me. He was alone but asked to join us for part of the trip, but he stayed just north of the Mongolia border. Anyways, he was so cool! He played with me all the time. He had the neatest pelt color too, dark brown, a big white mane and his aura stuck out of his face like-like a-a pimple?</b></p><p>

</p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jcvxBAi.png" border="1"></center><p>

I raised my eyebrows, <b>Like a gem?</b></p><p>


Iri giggled, <b>Yeah exactly! He told me stories! Did you know theres a fralir out there whos bigger than Luchairt?! This guys dad was, he said his dad was so big he touched the clouds!!</b></p><p>

I acted impressed and said, <b>Oh wow really?</b></p><p>

Iri's tail wagged even harder, he wore a big toothy smile, <b>Yeah he said his dad wasn't allowed outside when it snowed cause he would blend in. Also, my friend was really strong and even taught me how to pounce silently. Wanna see?
</b></p><p>

Not thinking anything of it I nod and the little Iri showed me how to pounce silently for hours. I copied him and he masterfully showed me. Thinking about what he said over and over it clicked. His friends dad blended in with snow and clouds, and he had his aura in a gem on his forehead. If his mother had that gem... they would technically fit the prophecy. I freeze in position thinking about it.<br>
Silzera started walking out of the castle, Iri forgot about me and ran to his mother. I took the opportunity to run to Luna and let her know what I discovered.</p><p>

-------------------------</p><p>

</p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nurpKPb.png" border="1"></center><p>

Iri and Silzera were summoned to the throne room minutes later. No crowd this time, just us, Luna and her bodyguards.  Sitting before her I told her about what Iri told me. Iri excitedly told her more about his friend, including his name, Zeneloc. Iri's tail never stopped wagging for a second the moment he spoke of this friend. Iri chirped,<b> He was born in India and for some reason moved to central Russia.</b> Luna kept nodding in response to him.</p><p>

Dedeck scribbled down notes of the kits descriptions. Silzera finally spoke up after asking her cub to quiet down, <b>I will write down the pickup and drop off points for this mysterious fralir. I was unaware you were seeking someone. What is this about? Was he a fugitive?</b></p><p>

Luna shook her head, <b>Not at all, we believe this fralir is a part of a prophecy. Once we have more information and talk to him in person we will let you know. As far as we know this is a good prophecy, no danger.</b></p><p>

Iri intently watched the conversation without chiming in, much better behaved than most children. Silzera let the stress from her shoulders drop, <b>I trust you Luna. I'll leave the rest in your capable hands. But we must be going.</b> She stood, bowed and walked out, cub in tow.</p><p>

Luna looked over to Dedeck, <b>Hurry, lets finalize the docoment for the twins and get it sent out. We need to move fast to locate him.</b></p><p>



</p></div></center><br><br><br><br><div style="width: 90%; background-color: #99d0f8; border: 5px dotted #e07a5f; overflow: auto; height: 400px; padding: 20px; text-align: justify; color: #204d7e;">

Weeks later I was back out in the garden soaking up the sun after another divination attack, the prophecy was pretty specific so I was able to have a maid deliver it outside the castle. But still I was aching all over, jittery and weak so I figured the sun would do me some good.<p>

My back in the grass, the lawn smelled fresh and every flower bed was in bloom. The breeze felt nice and cool against the summer heat. Even with my eyes close I can see the red of the sun against my eyelids.</p><p>

 Suddenly it goes dark. I open my eye expecting the sun to blind me from above but instead I see a shadow moving towards me, blocking the sun like an eclipse. </p><p>

<i>WOOSH.</i></p><p>

</p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HwNpqRh.png" border="1"></center><p>

Gasping, in a flash the shadow is behind me. I look behind me to see that shadow-black cheetah from before. <b>Bolzar, is that you?</b></p><p>

The cheetah was lightly panting from flight, he jumps at the sound of his own name and turns to look at me. Finding his words he huffed, <b>Divination Master, we found him.</b></p><p>

I sit up, and scowl at him. <b>Missy.</b> I growl, ignoring the information he gave me.</p><p>

He blinks a few times in confusion. <b>Missy?</b></p><p>

I smile a little at him, almost teasing him. <b>Yes, that's my name, now use it!</b></p><p>

He paused sheepishly he looks from the pillars left of us, passed me and then to the flower beds on the right. Avoiding eye contact. He takes a deep breath still a little out of it, <b>Miss Missy, please I need you to tell Luna hes on the way.</b> He then moves off to the pillars shade to sit down, still avoiding eye contact.</p><p>

 While listening I tilt my head a little, was I intimidating him? I don't know, but this is wonderful news! Completely ignoring my pain from earlier. I find myself racing into the castle in search of Luna leaving Bolzar by himself in the shade and catching his breath.</p><p>


I run at top speed, hitting corners a little too fast. I decide to skip going into the castle and aim for the front door to get directly into the throne room. Just as I whip around a corner I find myself run into someones leg. <b>Ouch</b>. I shake off the collision from where I landed.</p><p>

A young voice said, <b>Are you okay little one?</b></p><p>

<b>I'm fine, sorry about that.</b> Looking at the ground and rubbing my eye. Not recognizing the voice I look up into a large teenage lion with a dark chocolate pelt, with a snowy white mane and a ruby between his eyes. His dark red eyes pierced me, despite the startling color he really does have an honest face.</p><p>

I pause rubbing my eye, taking in a good look of him. Easily the same size as Luchairt and nothing but a teenager. His paws are easily twice the size of my body. He looks at me concerned and nudges me with his paw. <b>Are you ok?</b> A thick Russian accent attached to his voice.</p><p>

</p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UqmjcBm.png" border="1"></center><p>

Behind him Trapandor comes jogging up with Bolzar in tow. Both laugh at my reaction to the giant teenage lion. Trapandor, still giggling says, <b>Zeneloc this is Missy who prophesied your arrival, shes probably just surprised because she doesn't even weigh as much as your head.</b></p><p>

Bolzar knocks Trapandor on the head, a much deserved smack.</p><p>



Missy gathers get thoughts and points towards the large doors in from of them, not taking her eyes off Zeneloc. <b>Lets go in Luna is waiting.</b></p><p>

Zen nodded and pushes the door open. Both Luchairt and Dedeck are in their bodyguard positions, eyes open to the size of dinner plates. Luna sat at her throne, stone face with no emotion. Zeneloc slowly walks in, taking in his surroundings. The pillars, the pews, the soft carpet, and the tiny dark pelted house cat sitting on a throne protected by two lions. Trapandor, Bolzar and I follow behind and make our way to the pews to spectate.</p><p>

Finally Zen locks eyes with Luna and bows her. He took in a mighty breath, <b>Once the blizzard and the fiery ruby ally, a descendant is revealed as the raven's regent.<br> I am Zeneloc, son of Zahure the blizzard and Rubinder the fiery ruby. I believe I am the regent the prophecy called for.</b> He lifts his head and slowly lowers his body lying on his stomach to show respect to the master of the castle.</p><p>

Luna stood from her throne, made her way down the steps, and passed her body guards. They dare not speak during this meeting. Luna was still emotionless, walking around the teenage lion and clearly gauging his credibility and strength. He only moves his head slightly to keep his eyes on her. Luna makes it all the way around and to his face, even laying on him stomach it was two feet in the air. Luna then stood on her hind legs and placed a paw on his nose. She switched back to her motherly smile and said, <b>Welcome Zeneloc, lets work together well.</b></p><p>

The giant chocolate lion sweetly smiled back and mumbled a thank you.</p><p>
