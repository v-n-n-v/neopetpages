The morning starts as it always does. It's a grey, dreary morning. The air is cold and crisp, but I don't shiver even as it bites at me when I step outside to check the mail. Unlike every other morning, instead of bills or spam, I have an actual letter.<br><br>

Follow the map, and gather the items for a potion that'll save you. Ignore this if you wish. If you'd rather live in ignorance. Good luck, LN.

<br><br><br><br>Welcome to the story.<br>Here are some quick notes before we begin:<br></center>
<div id="scrollbox" style="height: 400px;">
♦ This page requires you to hover your mouse over images to read descriptions and click to other loc<i></i>ations in the map. The links within the map are invisible and are found via mouseover.<br><br>
♦ Mobile users should still be able to play through the page by clicking the links, but since they won't be able to hover over them, finding them may be more difficult and mouseover descriptions will not be displayed. There are no non-clickable hovers, so the story should otherwise play basically the same. However, due to the increased difficulty, it is still recommended to play on desktop if possible.<br><br>
♦ Sometimes LN himself is clickable! Make sure to check, since sometimes he is the link in a page or can provide extra content.<br><br>
♦ When outside, clicking the edges of the map will take you to other areas of the forest. When inside, clicking gaps (doorways) and stairs will take you from room to room.<br><br>
♦ This page contains looping gifs. It's possible that some people may need to wait for the gif to restart to see it properly, as all the gifs are already loaded and thus already playing - if things seem confusing, just wait for the loop to start over again.<br><br>
♦ The page itself does not keep track of what items you've already gathered. You do not technically need to gather every item to progress, but it is recommended that you look around anyway for extra content and context!<br><br>
♦ If the text is cut off due to a difference in font or screen resolution, you can zoom out a little until everything seems to be in frame.

My cellar. This is where I go to write in my journal. I've been very bad at keeping up with it lately though, and it doesn't help that at night the cellar feels kind of creepy. It only has one light fixture and a lamp, so it's always kind of dark, but it's the only room I have to put my writing desk. Ignore the boxes, that's just stuff I haven't sifted through since I moved here. Probably full to the brim with spyders and other pests.

The most recent entry says:
<div id="scrollbox">
<b>June 11th, 20XX</b><br><i>
　　　Some odd things have happened recently. A few weeks ago while on my couch, Skitters began to growl and hiss at the back door. When I peeked out the window there was someone standing far off by the tree line, staring straight at the house. But just as soon as I had seen them, they were gone. Similarly, while on a night walk to clear my head just a few days ago, I saw what I thought was the tallest... thing? I'd ever seen run past the trees. I was shaken up but assumed it was just some animal running wild. I do live in the forest after all.<br>
　　　But even the house feels different, things in general just feel different. I'm hoping things go back to normal, though. Things haven't seemed normal in what feels like forever, but I mean MY normal. Well, whatever. I have to go get the mail.</i>

This is my upstairs... hall-type thing. It's not quite a hallway, more like a hall area? Anyway, it's boring here because it's just a walk-through. I'm going to be honest, that drawer thing has nothing in it but dust. It's just there because I didn't know where to put it.

I don't like the air of this attic. Never have. It's not like anything's even happened up here, I just don't like it. It... gives me déjà vu, but like, bad? I stare quietly into the room, hearing nothing but the creaks of the house and the small jingle of the hanging light swaying in the darkness. Despite nothing seeming off, I still get a bit of a chill standing here.

Skitters' bed is untouched. She always wants to sleep either right next to me or on the ceiling. She's not in here right now it seems... I wonder if she got out of the house again? I hate that she's so slithery, but she always comes back fine. Can't say the same for the local wildlife though.

I don't remember why this mirror is broken. Honestly, it's been broken for a long time. I probably did something stupid like maybe I accidentally flung something at it and it shattered into bits. It's pretty cheap anyways, maybe I should get a new one... Some of the broken glass is still on the floor. Better be careful.

This is the lake, it's nice over here. I watch the fish swim around sometimes, and I also really love this tree. It's beautiful! Skitters likes to drink this water sometimes. I don't want her to but she does. She just loves anything that isn't in her water bowl, I guess.

This is supposedly a lake, though honestly sometimes I think it's more like a pond. According to the letter it looks like I have to fish. Great. I hate fishing!

This well has been in this little clearing for years. It's not connected to a pump or anything, and there's no homes nearby that it connects to, so I have no idea why it's here. The water inside always smells and looks gross. Skitters would probably drink it, so thank goodness it's too far down for her to reach. Maybe I should take a closer look. It seems to be marked?

The guy that lived here was a shy author. He didn't really talk to people much, and probably went to town even less than I did. He was also really superstitious, the kind of person who thought breaking mirrors caused bad luck. I was nice to him, though - I'd stop by sometimes to check on him, but it was always a gamble whether he was happy to see me or not.<br><br>Sometimes I come over to stare at the caution tape... I wonder what happened to him. The only other person who visited him was some girl, and after he vanished she never came around again, so I couldn't ask.<br><br>Anyway, the window and door are boarded up. Can't go in through those, but maybe the roof...?

Looking at how the shack looks now, I think about the times I visited beforehand. I can't help but wonder if, had I known him better, he wouldn't have vanished or something. I guess there's part of me that doesn't... care. Maybe it's because I didn't know him that well. It's hard to miss someone you barely interacted with.<br><br>Regardless of all that, this area makes me uncomfortable. I feel like I'm being watched.

This is a big abandoned sewer tunnel thing? I'm not sure what it is exactly. Either way I've never been in there, I peeked in there once a while ago and heard some... uncanny noises. I decided I'd rather leave whatever creatures have taken hold of it alone. Guess that's about to change, though.

There's a flimsy fence that has only ever been on this side of the forest. They completely gave up on finishing it I guess, considering it's been like that since I moved here. I kinda hate it.<br><br>Beyond it is the denser forest. Sometimes I see animals while standing over here, which is nice. It looks like there's something hanging from that treetop, but something stops me from crossing the fence. I wouldn't be able to reach it anyway, so it's whatever.

There's a baseball cap in the tree, being held up there by the needles. It's too high up for me to reach it. Wonder whose it was... and how it got all the way up there in the first place, really.

I stare through the forest. It gives me a sense of nostalgia. Didn't I walk through these woods like, two months ago? Why am I getting nostalgic about it? Maybe it's just because I've been in my house so much. I like walking through this area a lot, though. But I can't do that right now, not with this stupid letter getting me all curious.

Okay? Weird. He's right about one thing, though - I don't care. I'm not going to listen to him.

I was actually here when the tree fell over. I was out while it was storming, which, yeah, kind of an idiot move in a forest, but it was nice. I wasn't too close to the tree when I saw it get hit by lightning and fall. Watching the electricity cra<i></i>ckle through the tree sure was something, though I was surprised the tree didn't catch on fire. I guess the rain probably helped with that. Now it just lays on the ground. I see bugs hanging out around it a lot, they love the thing. Skitters loves the bugs.

I rip some bark off of the tree stump, since I need it apparently. For some reason the stump is 'bleeding' this dark black liquid... it kinda smells like... licorice? Whatever, no time to question it.

I stare down the road. Most of this road leads to absolutely nowhere, though there's a couple farms if you go far enough. I don't have a vehicle. It's always a sight when one passes by, but it's not very common. There's an old abandoned car further off by the trees, and it's been there for a long time. Years, I think. I'm not too sure, but definitely a while. I remember when police were checking it out. I kind of thought they'd take it away but they never did. Otherwise, there's nothing interesting over here.

The last time I ate these, I threw up. Badly. I still don't know what kind of berries they are, and I probably shouldn't try one again. I really should get a berry guide or something, honestly.

I've eaten probably hundreds of these and they never made me feel sick. They're great! Nice and sweet. I still don't know what kind of berries they are though. I just wish they were red... that's my favorite color.

I ate one of these once. They're pretty bitter and taste awful, but at least they aren't poisonous. I don't know what they are, but it doesn't really matter. For some reason looking at the color makes me kind of angry. Wonder what that'd mean to a psychologist.

I tried one of these once. <strong>Never. Again.</strong> They're... sweet, but with a <i>terrible</i> aftertaste. Plus they're full to the brim of these nasty little seeds that make my whole body shudder. Gross. I don't know what kind of berries they are, and I don't care. I wish they didn't exist.

This dead tree has probably been here since I moved here. It's never had a single leaf on it, and petpets won't even touch it, which seems strange. I find a weird red rock inside of it. It's like if a regular rock was red instead of regular - a stunning observation from yours truly. That seems to mark off one thing from my list. Cool.

This is, uh, basically Skitters' tree. Doesn't look like she's here right now, though. She likes to gather up shiny things and random stuff she finds around the woods when she escapes, then she places it high up in the branches of this tree where she <i>knows</i> I can't reach. It's kind of cute to be honest. She's got some crazy stuff up there. I probably can't even see it all from here. Looks like her newest addition is that random sock.

I wonder how they knew Skitters was going to be in just the right spot for me to find... Weird. I guess I'm almost done with this.

As I walk the air grows even colder than it already was. It's only now I realize how stagnant the air has been since I woke up this morning... how stagnant it's been for a long long time. I look at Skitters. She brings me comfort just by being there, and her soft chittering breaks the uneasy quiet of this area. Each step almost feels like a whisper in the dark. The trees up ahead are beginning to rot and die, and it looks like after a certain point there will no longer be a living tree to see.

There's a large slab on the ground, and these two strangers are standing around doing nothing, much like that stranger back at the roadside. They're watching me intently as I walk up to the slab.
<br><br>The slab has a small cauldron with a fire lit underneath, despite a lack of kindling beneath it. The trees here are dead, and the air feels thick. Skitters makes an excited noise.

I pour the wellwater and pink gem into the cauldron. I then add the bleeding bark, and the red rock from the dead tree. The items begin to slowly dissolve in the water, reacting in strange ways to the black ooze. I drop in the gold ring, then the mutated fish - it wriggles, somehow still alive after all this time. I watch as it, too, dissolves alongside everything else. I crush up the candles from the sewer with my bare hands and add them, the wax quickly melting into the water.<br><br>As I stir the strange concoction, the water begins to glow a bright, beautiful red.<br><br>

This was one of my few grocery runs into town, and I couldn't help but stop and stare at the missing posters that had been put up. Multiple people in the region had gone missing recently, especially near the woods where I was living. According to townspeople, the woods had become dangerous. This wasn't the Haunted Woods, yet there were many tales of monsters roaming the forest and of hearing strange noises coming from the woods at night. That, paired with the missing people, made it all the more terrifying. Many people saw me as a shy friend and had kindly warned me to be careful out there.<br><br>I was about to finally turn away when I heard a voice.

They had surrounded the forest with items that would keep me in one place. I felt it quickly after they arrived. I thought I could hold my own.

The clerics entered my home. They were speaking that putrid language, their holy words spitting off of their tongues and into the air. The words burned my ears and my skin. I had tried throwing things at them, but being surrounded by those disgusting blue pendants drained my energy.

They pushed me all the way up to my attic. They quickly surrounded me with a strange blue symbol, and I thought for sure this was the day I was going to die. They spoke of banishing me. It hurt so bad, but I was putting up a horrifying fight.<br><br>
I think they underestimated me.<br><br>-<a href="#fight5">Continue.</a><br></div>

I think the spell had to have been a Time Banishment Spell. While the real world was changing around me, I was going through the same four months continously. March, April, May, June... and then back to March, over and over again. Things would change around me to trick my brain into thinking everything was normal, and at the start of every loop I'd forget the last one.<br><br>The loop also seemed to make me forget my nature. I didn't know what I was.<br><br>What a shame.

I don't know how many loops in it was that I started to realize something was off, but I did. Maybe it was because I didn't remember how I got the scar on my face, or because Skitters always seemed so antsy. Regardless, at some point I had begun to remember, though only somewhat. Déjà vu can only be explained away for so long before you start putting pieces together. My otherworldly nature broke through the spell's hold, just a <i>little</i>. But it was enough to formulate a plan.

The clerics weren't the only people who knew magic. I knew that the loop would likely make me forget what exactly was going on, but I also knew that if I moved something, the loop would keep it that way to avoid making me suspicious. I used this to my advantage and wrote myself a letter containing the steps to making a potion that would, if I was right, break me out of this. I tricked myself into believing someone else out there knew something - a means of escape I was unaware of.<br><br><i>And what do you know? I was right, after all.</i>

The memories flash before my eyes, my head aching with the pressure of them. Pain wracks through my body, crawling through each vein, burning my insides and turning me inside out. I scream out into the night.<br><br>It's a horrible pain, yet a welcome one.

The stone slab bursts open, shards of rock erupting from it. Dozens of hands burst forth from the stone, grasping onto my body.

It's a late night and I can't sleep. I've been staring at this picture for what seems like hours, memories and regret swirling inside of me. There's a pit in my throat.
<br><br>I don't know why, but something in the air feels wrong tonight.<br></div>

<br>
It's a nice afternoon, but I'm not outside enjoying it. I've been standing over by my phone for a while. The air has felt heavy lately, and I've been having nightmares about that night again. I keep thinking about calling my old friend, Juvieal. We... grew distant after what happened. I always wanted to talk to him again, but I was scared. I think we both were.

I've been nervously whispering his phone number to myself for what seems like eons, but I finally steel myself and gather the courage to lift the phone. As I'm about to tack in the numbers, I hear a thunk outside my front door.

<br><br>-<a href="#cleroom2">Is someone here?</a><br></div>

<div id="container" style="margin-top: 4000px;">
<a name="cleroom2"></a>
<center><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0OsuSq4.png"></center>

For a moment, I just listen to see if I hear it again. I had dropped the phone in surprise, and now it's hanging from the side of the table, moving slightly in the breeze. I can hear the phone droning its off-the-hook sound. I can hear my clock ticking nearby.<br><br>Then there it is again - a thunk by my door. I feel a sense of dread, but I ignore it and make my way to the door.
<br><br>-<a href="#cleroom3">Check to see who it is.</a><br></div>

The second I reach the door, it flies open, cr<i></i>acking into the wall beside it. The outside air is unnaturally cold, and a monster bursts in.<br><br>I scream, scrambling backwards and falling to the floor. The beast laughs, reveling in my fear. Its familiar voice, the glowing gem... I never thought it'd come back, or, at least, not this soon.

I stare up at the demon in front of me. Its many hands are shifting and grasping at nothing, and the black hole of its face eminates an ominous groan. I can feel the evil scratching through my living room, corrupting the very air around me. I need to... do something.

I throw my pendant upward in a desperate attempt to rid myself of the beast before me. I hadn't seen it like this the last time.<br><br><i>I must have faith</i>, I think. <i>I am not alone in this fight.</i><br><br>As if sensing my thoughts, the beast laughs in my face.

Its gem flies forward, its laughs continuing to echo through my ears. The skittering creature in its maw chitters along with it. The gem glows a bright red, forcing my hand to release the pendant - and as I do, the pendant cr<i></i>acks, then completely shatters. The symbol of protection falls to the ground with a soft clunk, but to me it's louder than an earthquake.

I don't have much time to ponder what to do next. It's obvious that my pendant didn't weaken the creature, and it dawns on me right then that I'm not getting out of this. No words, no spells, no anything will protect me from the beast's vile, hideous rage.<br><br>I just wish that I had called Juvieal like I planned.<br><br><font color="red">‟At least you tried something, Cleric.‟</font> The beast mocks.

The gem flies in front of my face, burning a soft but eerie red. <font color="red">‟What do you think of yourself, Cleric? Do you feel weak? Do you regret it?‟</font><br><br> I stare into the gem. My voice catches in my throat. <i>‟...No. I regret... I regret not keeping you trapped for all time.‟</i><br><br>It growls. <font color="red">‟It's what Noreis would've wanted, I assume.‟</font> It says, angry at my lack of guilt.

I turn away from my old home and begin walking back to the road. I think about the past few years fondly - before all of this happened, anyway. Skitters chitters at me, nuzzling my face as we leave it all behind. I can feel an ache blooming in my chest. Saying goodbye to old memories is hard.

<div id="scrollbox">
<b>July 23rd, 20XX</b><br><i>　　　I'm finally moved into the new place after everything went down. I'm pretty ecstatic, honestly. I feel more at home than I have in a long, long time. That old house was being haunted by myself for so long. I'm here now, though. I think I'm going to go back to how things were, somewhat, but maybe with more planning and being careful. I'm also hoping to get Skitters harness trained, maybe it'll stop her from running around outside so much. I also made sure the vents are secure so she won't squeeze through them.<br>
　　　While I make my new normal, I'll have to get used to the Haunted Woods being louder than my old place. At the same time, I spent... 'months' looping in the same eerie forest for so long, so this might not take much to get used to. I'm planning on doing my first grocery run into one of the towns soon. I hope it goes well.</i>

Skitters is playing with her new toy. I got a ton of them for her recently so she can have more enrichment. There's not a lot made specifically for Intesteens unfortunately, but these variety packs for other petpets seem to work just fine. She does get a bit growly if I get too close to her toy mouse while she's playing with it, but she's probably just thinking I'll take it from her like I do with the living Miamice she captures too.
