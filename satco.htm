<h1>Neopet References Guide</h1>

Welcome to my reference guide!

<br><br>On this guide, you will discover the movies, shows, memes, books, and other pop culture media that inspire The Neopets Team. 

<br><br>What is a reference, you may ask? Well, it's sort of like an aspect of Neopets that was based off of something in, or hinting at, the real world. An easter egg, if you will.

<br><br>Neopets is teeming with images that seem like traditionally wacky TNT-style ideas, but on closer inspection, those images are actually references to popular culture in today's society!

<br><br>I hope you enjoy my findings! :D


<br><br>
If you have any references that are not yet listed, please feel free to Neomail <a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=weedle11">me</a> (weedle11) the item name and what it is a reference to!
<br>Seeking more affiliates and listers as well!

<br><br><b>Like the new header image? I think it's good, but it needs something. Tell me what you think <a href="//www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send&amp;recipient=weedle11">here</a>!</b>

<br><br><b><i>Hover over the images on the left to see the navigation categories! Hopefully this will fix the navigation covering the images problem.
<br>Made them all myself, too :D</i></b>

<br><br>Another note: While I'm not on hiatus, life is going to be pretty busy for my for quite a while, so if you nm me a reference and don't see it added to the future section in 3 weeks or so, please, feel free to remind me to add it! It'll be a big help!
<br><b>Update: I'm going on a hiatus for a while, since college is starting. I'll do my best to get back to people, but guide updates will be few and far between</b>

<h1>Help/Future Additions</h1>

I have never seen nor know about all of the things TNT reference, so I don't actually understand some of the jokes, and I can't put pictures to them. If anybody could fill me in on some obscure references, that would be great!

<br><br> Need to add Lord Inglip and Ziggy from the Haunted House

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/frontpage/grundoband_2004.gif"> Band Gruundo=Motley Crue. Originally spelt with U with dots over it or Motorhead

<br><br>Wanna buy some pegs?" is a reference to Papa Lazarou from the League of Gentlemen (some British sitcom). He would come to your house and ask "Do you want to buy some pegs, Dave?" before kidnapping you and making you join his circus-thing.

<br><br>Pterducken - References turducken, the weird food item famously discussed by american football commentator John Madden

<br><br>The secret Meerca Chase II level Super Extra Hyper Gravity is named after an album released by the band The Cardigans.

<br><br>In battle with the tiki tack man, he may say "Daylight come and we wanna go home!" reference to The Banana Boat Song.

<br><br>Near the end of the ski lodge murder mystery, Maverick holds #6 over a cliff. #6 says "Do you expect me to talk?" Maverick says "No, #6, I expect you to die!" Reference to Goldfinger

<br><br>On Virtupets Space Station there's a message that says "The loudspeaker booms: McCoy to the sickbay, McCoy to the sickbay." Dr. McCoy from Star Trek. 

<br><br>Coco Neocrunch (Coco Puffs)

<br><br>Strange Green Seeds might refer to the fairy tale Jack and the Beanstalk

<br><br>Usuki Dream Castle (as well as Usuki Dream Car, Usuki Dream Wardrobe, and other Usuki Dream ____ items--you can find a list on the Usuki Spoiler list in the Usuki store) is a Barbie reference

<br><br>The petpet Nedler resembles an Ood from Doctor Who

<br><br>Skeith Space Station Security Officer wearables - Battlefield Earth 

<br><br>Rustic male Usul wearables = Hercules TV series 
Rustic female Ususl wearables - xena 

<br><br>Peophin Desperado wearables - Zorro? Desperado?

<br><br>The Cellblock opponent Haskoi's description seems like a reference (I think to Star Wars). 

<br>Han Solo: Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. 
<br>C-3PO: But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. 
<br>Han Solo: That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. 
<br>Chewbacca: Grrf. 
<br>C-3PO: I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, R2: let the Wookiee win. 

<br><br>The petpet Garfir is a manticore, by the way. I think they're from Greek or maybe Persian mythology. 

<br><br>The Sunutek looks like the floating eye design on the back of the dollar bill, which is often said to be a symbol of the Freemasons. 

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/kyrii_swordsman.png">Either Jerry from Tom and Jerry or one of the Three Musketeers (remember the french episodes with the grey mouse?)

<br><br> the Journey to the Lost Isle plot is heavily influenced by "The Lost World" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (if you haven't read it or seen it on TV it's about a professor who sets up an expedition and discovers a land populated by dinosaurs, one of the expedition members is called Lord Roxton).

<br><br>Quoth Evil Sloth Clone: Have you ever thought of joining the dark side? 

<br><br>Quoth Tiki Tack Man: Just can't get enough! Daylight come and we wanna go home! 

<br><br>Quoth Koi Warrior: What are you a Neopet or a mouse?

<br><br>The avatar from the Cyodrake's Gaze plot is a reference to Firefly. The quote "a leaf on the wind" is from Serenity, the Firefly movie, and Hoban's name refers to Hoban Washburne, known as Wash, who says the quote. 

<br><br><img src="http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/7811/princessbride.png" height="200" width="200"><br>a character named Vizzini who says: You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - The most famous of which is "never get involved in a land war in Asia" - but only slightly less well-known is this: "Never go against a Sicilian when death is on the line" (From the Princess Bride)

<br><br><img src="//pets.neopets.com/cp/bbhsrrrj/1/4.png" height="150" width="150">Is this Luffy's Scar from the anime One Piece?

<br><br>Mutant Kiko: Geodude

<br><br>green lantern cake

<br><br>Firefly reference I've noticed in the game Keyquest. In the scripted chat box one of the things you can say is "Shiny, captain" which is a quote from Kaylee in the pilot episode, 'shiny' being a word often used throughout the show in place of words like good or nice. More often than not it is used sarcastically though.

<br><br>Hoban is a reference to the character Hoban Wash and the traveling draik outfit is the Captain Mal.

<br><br>The Festive Birthday Wig is pink and red, but I believe it's a reference to Pinkie Pie, has the exact same flick at the front as she does. Plus birthdays are totally her thing. (unconfirmed)

<br><br>Bledynn the skeith has a sword called Vera which is a reference to Jayne from Firefly as he has a weapon called Vera as well.

<br><br>And the book Waking the Draik seems to be a reference to Viserys in Game of Thrones when he warns Dany not to wake the dragon.

<br><br>Dark Enchanted Cape looks a lot like the cloaks used in the Lord of the Rings movies.

<br><br>A Tale of Two Lupes and A Tale of Two Slorgs reference the title of the novel A Tale of Two Cities

<br><br>The episode is Our Mrs Reynolds, and a conversation between Mal and Jayne. Not entirely sure the quote is entirely suitable for neopets given the nature of the weapon, but the part of it that doesn't mention the weapon is Mal: What I got? She has a name. Jayne: So does this. I call it Vera.

<br><br>Fancy Petpet Food is a reference to fancy feast (the slogan is similiar and the labels on the cans are quite similiar) that one I am sure of. (unconfirmed)

<br><br>The Fantastical Marshmallow Background looks a lot like the land of Sugar Rush in Wreck-it-Ralph. (unconfirmed)

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/moehog_waroutfit.png"> Something from Zelda, I'm thinking Twilight Princess? Best guess so far was a Phantom from Spirit Tracks

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/moehog_styleoutfit.png">I want to guess Madeline? It could be from something else

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/yurble_hermitoutfit.png"> Frodo Baggins from Lord of the Rings. Or Gandalf. Or Radagast. I'm not sure, really

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/koi_captainoutfit.png"> Capt Crunch

<br><br>Space Faerie Cereal's description is referencing the famous line from 2001: A Space Odyssey. "My GOSH, it's full of stars!" (obviously gosh was the other word but yknow)

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/hissi_decoroutfit.png">Daisy from F.Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (probably)

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/lupe_chefoutfit.png">The Muppet Chef person (unconfirmed, but i think they look alike)

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/tuskaninny_eldm_happy.png"> Smee from Peter Pan, or one of the Dwarves from Snow White

<br><br><img src="http://i1120.photobucket.com/albums/l493/weedle11/plotreference1_zps75d6b862.png"><br><br>The Sleuthing Background also uses the silhouette of The British Parliament and Big Ben

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/ruki_rb_happy.png"> Legolas

<br><br>The book "We dont need stinkin apostrophes!" is a reference to a famous line from the Humphrey Bogart film Treasure of the Sierra Madre: "We don't need stinkin' badges"

<br><br>And the book "News... in... SPACE!" references a joke segment from the end of History of the World Part 1, where a bunch of fake movie trailers are shown.

<br><br>The book It Came From the Mine is a reference to the '50's movie It Came From Outer Space 

<br><br>Halloween Deaver=Max from Where the Wild Things Are

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mall_cp_goth.gif">Deadly Beauty Costume Pack = Adam's Family

<br><br>You launch into "The Pant Devil Went Down to Altador" and play your banjo fiercely. The doppelgangers inside are totally overwhelmed by your mad banjo skills and surrender. They even give you a nifty item out of respect. (in the Catacombs) - The Devil Went Down to Georgia

<br><br>The Deathly Union Costume Pack is a reference to Emily, the title character from the film Corpse Bride.

<br><br>Stitched Doll Face Paint is a reference to Sally from The Nightmare Before Christmas.

<br><br>They made a few references in TFR in Hanso's dialogue. The line "please understand I hold you in the highest respect" is from the Princess Bride movie. His line about "time for some thrilling heroics" is from the firefly show (not sure of the character, though, most sources say it's Jayne.) I've checked both of those.

<br><br>May the Best Petpet Win - play on the idiom "may the best man win", which is said in the spirit of
sportsmanship.

<br><br>In the "Triumph" achievement in the Faeries' Ruin, the description "How appropriate. You fight like a kau." is a reference to the video game series "Monkey Island" in which it is an insult that Guybrush uses a lot (as a running gag)

<br><br>Also the "The Phantoms' Menace" achievement is a reference to the Star Wars movie "The Phantom Menace"

<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/nf/aisha_rockidoloutfit.png"> Buddy Holly

<br><br>Neopia in Space Background - Twilight Zone;
<br><br>In Space, no one can hear you cry for your mother' - In the BD, reference to Alien the film. 

<br><br>The "Futuristic Hugh Bun Wig" is clearly inspired by the looks of Gem and the other Sirens from Tron Legacy. Even the description hints at this, saying it would look good with white, the main color of Gem/the Sirens

<br><br>The description for Plate of Lime Biscuits is 'Have them with some coconut and shake it all up' which is a reference to the song Coconut by Harry Nilsson.


<br><br>I should really start updating the actual guide and not the will do in the future section...

<h1>Voting Section</h1>

<p>Here, you can vote to see if these are references or not. I think they could be, but I want your opinions. If you think they are or are not, NM <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=weedle11">me</a> your vote!

<br>I may be putting things here that have multiple possibilities for the reference as well

Is this outfit from Oliver Twist, or Newsies?

<br><br>Newsies:4, Oliver:6, neither:2

<br>I really can't decide between these two, both seem to be very accurate...

<h1>Notes/Credits</h1>



This is my first ever guide, as well as my first major attempt at coding. Thank you SN for the original background,  various users for telling me some of these references, JN for images and confirming references, and <a href="/~thatkillsme">That Kills Me</a> for the new layout template

  </div>


  <div class="module">


<h1>Help Me</h1>

Any (unconfirmed) at the end of a description means that I'm not entirely sure if it is accurate. Please, NM me to confirm/disprove them!

<br>And if anyone has any references not previously mentioned please NM them to <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=weedle11">me</a>

  </div>

<div class="module">



<h1>Notice</h1>
I would appreciate it if you could Neomail references to my main, weedle11, and not ilkilkilk3, unless I am coding. I will usually have a board open on the Help Chat at that time. Thank you! (If you do, expect a long wait for a reply, vs one in the next day or so)

<br><br>Also, I do read the editorial, and will NOT be adding any answers or random customizations that TNT puts into them that reference anything. They have stated their Bronyhood and openly talked about Harry Potter before. I feel like this isn't as subtle and unique as their other references, so I will not be including them 

<br><br>I will also not be including any references stated in the News that TNT post daily

<br><br>Also, NM/posting on my board gives me the right to use your exact words in the 404 or Future Sections. I will try to change them to my own eventually. The Future part is just a way to save the stuff before I update it

<br><br>Check it out! I was in the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=565">editorial!</a> (9th one down) I (indirectly) was the one who made the *spyder* smilie! :D
