    <p>Gathered on the neoboards and offsite <sub>Last Update June 14th, 2024</sub> TNT has just released a new official FAQ for the NT on June 11th 2024, However their "what's allowed" section was taken down, presumably to be re-written.

<h2 id="LP">PRIORITIES
    </h2>
<p>Fixes most in need of attention both technical and administrative</p>


<p>  



</p><h3>Submission Timelines for Themed Issues.</h3>
<ul><li>
 It's great that the news is putting out reminders about themed issues! Many people don't check neoboards, and wouldn't know without these announcements. However for the halloween issue, the <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2023-10-16">reminder went out the week of the NT (Monday) </a>, and said that people had until Thursday to submit, but no acceptance letters went out after Wednesday. Many people were still working on halloween themed entries after no more entries were being published. 
</li></ul><p>- Suggestions: (no particular order)</p>
<p>
</p><ol><li> While we're on the bi-weekly schedule, post the theme reminder the week before, so people have more time to work on entries.</li>
<li> If there's a limit to how many entries will be published, hold off until the stated due date before filling all slots and review remaining entries all at once.</li>
<li> Further Increase Number of Entries Published for themed issues </li>
</ol><p></p>

<p>
</p><h3>More consistent Submission Timeline with Queue Clearing.</h3>
<ul><li> It's not clear when the queue will be wiped clear and people can begin submitting for the next issue with the current system. Make a consistent schedule/time for this!</li>
<li>More consistent rejection/TMGE (Too Many Good Entries) neomails would help people know when to resubmit.</li>
<li>Clearer limit on number of entries for regular issues. Some comic sections go to 20. Some only go to 15 or less. How many is "Too Many Good Entries"?</li>

<p>
<strong class="imp">Improved! </strong>: All submission times for all issues happen in the 2 weeks prior to publishing. Final day to submit before acceptances go out inconsistent.<sub>May 25th, 2024</sub></p></ul><p>
</p><h3> Add OUT OF ORDER note to thumbnail submission box on Comic Submission Page</h3>
<p> </p><ul><li> this has not worked in a while. If it cannot be quickly fixed, add an OUT OF ORDER note and leave instructions for users to add an img link to their thumbnail in the description box. </li>
    <li>might also need more character length in description box going forwards to make this easier to fit in with other required info (see next note: longer description box)</li></ul><p>
</p><h3> Longer Description Box for Submitting Entries </h3>

<ul><li> Especially on comics where we often need to fit the thumbnail URL, and/or on collaborations where each contributor must be listed along with what they did, there's not enough room to add all necessary info to the description box. Add in notes to the editor (eg. "For themed issue") and a description of the work itself, and there just aren't enough characters to fit everything</li></ul><h3> Add clear NO AI WRITING OR ART rule on all submission and rules pages</h3>
<ul><li>Self explanatory. The Art Gallery and Beauty Contest struggle with this a lot currently. We saw a few AI submissions get through into short stories in the NT but haven't seen any obvious offenders in a while. Consider a warning system for first offenders and harsher penalties for repeat offenders. </li>
</ul><p><strong class="imp">IMPROVED! </strong> New FAQ includes no AI rule. At time of writing, new FAQ is being re-written (presumably)<sub>June 12th, 2024</sub></p>


<h3>Rules Updates: On the <a href="//www.neopets.com/help_search.phtml?help_id=172">Handy Tips Page</a> some rules are out of date</h3>

 <ul class="smalltxt"><li>2. Things we'd prefer NOT to see in the Neopian Times
Technology such as electronics, cars, computers, and cellphones. Futuristic technology from the Space Station or Dr. Sloth is all right.
Real people or places or parodies of them. Neopia is another planet, after all. "
<p>
 - This is no longer true. Technology such as cellphones and cars are now allowed in the NT.</p>
    </li>

    <li>3. If you want to add bold or italic to your article or story, you can use html. We will take care of other formatting for you."
<p>
 - Formatting must be done with square brackets [] instead of HTML brackets. TNT will convert the square brackets to html brackets. <b>BONUS:</b> Consider fixing the form so users can format with HTML themselves to reduce work for TNT. See Wishlist for more ideas on formatting options.</p>
    </li>

<li>4. You can collaborate on your submission with up to one other person. Just put in a note in the comments with their username to let us know so that we can give them credit.</li>
<p> - We can now collaborate with up to 2 other people (3 total) </p>

</ul><strong class="imp">IMPROVED!</strong>  New FAQ is available! At time of writing, new FAQ is being re-written (presumably)<sub>June 12th, 2024</sub><h3>Rules Updates:on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/nt_submit.phtml">Neopian Times Submission Page</a></h3>

 <ul class="smalltxt"><li>
    1. Please note that if your image is too big, we may have to shrink it down to fit on the page. :

<p>
</p><h2 id="MI">MILESTONE ISSUES
</h2>
<p> The milestone Issues are highly competitive for many reasons. 975 had a lot of confusion around it and NT 1000 is coming up fast. NT 1000 will be on <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162731635"> Jan 26th, 2024!</a> </p>

<p></p><h3>Submission Timeline</h3><strong>DONE!</strong> <sub>editorial 997, dec 1st, 2023</sub><p>
</p><ul><li>Please make an announcement when submissions should begin for NT1000. Many people aren't aware of the current queue clearing system and no one knows how soon or late after an NT is published the queue will be cleared.</li></ul><p>UPDATE <sub> dec 1st, 2023</sub>: This was answered in <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=997">Editorial 997</a>! Submissions can begin being sent after issue 999 publishes. We are not currently sure when the backlog will be cleared</p>

<p></p><h3>Clarify Theme</h3>
<p>

</p><ul><li>
In the early days of the NT milestone issues there was no official theme. Many people used it as an opportunity to celebrate NT history, or to pull out pieces they'd worked especially hard on (such as a major twist or milestone in an ongoing series), or collaborate with friends. After the introduction of the avatar more weewoo themed pieces were made in reference to it and more weewoo themed pieces got in making it an unofficial theme. Now there's a misconception that pieces for milestone issues HAVE to be weewoo themed. Please include a rough outline of what sort of work might be favoured for the milestone issue. It'd be great to see all aspects of the NT celebrated on it's 1000th anniversary!</li></ul><p></p><h3>Prioritize People Without the Avatar (Popular + Controversial)</h3>
<ul><li>
The opportunity to get the milestone avatar only comes around once a year. Changing the release to every 25 issues instead of every 50 was a big help but competition is still tight. Some people have been trying for years. But there's also a lot of reasons for those who already have the avatar to still want in.</li></ul><table><tr><th width="50%">Pro</th>

    <ul class="procon"><li>Milestone issues hold sentimental value for authors who want to be part of NT history</li>
    <li>NT 1000 only happens once and the community is eager to celebrate it together!</li>
    <li>Some item prizes are exclusive to milestone issues and no one knows when an old one will come back, or if it'll be the coin again.</li>
    
</ul></td>
</tr></table><p></p><h3>Suggestions for Creating More Opportunities for Those who Don't have the Avatar</h3>
<p>In no Particular Order. Suggestions can be combined or isolated as needed</p>

<ol><li> <b>Make 1001 an overflow issue</b> so those who don't make it into issue 1000 have a chance to resubmit and still get the avatar for 1001. This eases the pressure for everyone to get everything in for NT 1k both for authors and the TNT editors. It could be a special NT1k treat! <b>Bonus:</b> Make this a regular thing for every 100 issues. (difficult to promise so far in the future) </li>
<li> <b>Announce the item prize ahead of time</b> so those who already have the avatar and are hunting the other milestone items other than the coin can choose to pass. Consider re-releasing the background and quill in some other manner.</li>
<li> <b>Larger Issue! (VERY POPULAR!)</b> Especially for 1000! Issue #300 was the largest issue we've ever had at 132 published entries, followed by Issue #500 at 130. Our user base isn't as big as it used to be, but surely we can do better than the 60s-70s range for issue 1k?

</p><h2 id="MJ">MAJOR FIXES</h2>

<p> These are Fixes that are greatly needed, but may take more time and resources to implement </p>

<p></p><h3>Mobile Friendly NT Layout</h3>
<p>
</p><ul><li>The biggest most resource intense fix! Give the NT a facelift with a mobile friendly layout. Mobile friendly layouts should still allow use with reader mode. This update understandably is probably a low priority but we'd love to see it some day!</li>
<li> See Wishlist for more ideas on additions that could be made to a new layout</li>
<p>TNT Sunpotato acknowledge a desire to make an updated NT layout in <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=968">Editorial 968</a>. No indication was made that it's been started.</p>
</ul><p></p><h3>Updated Submission System</h3>
<ul><li> Add a page that shows the status of submitted works. (Submitted, Accepted, Rejected) </li>
<li> Improve ability to replace submitted works with updated versions (similar to how Beauty Contest Entries can be changed until the contest starts)</li>
<li> Include the NT schedule on the submission page so people don't need to check the neoboards for it</li>
<li> Add optional boxes to write collaborator names. This could be used to help automate prize and trophy awards to collaboration partners and would leave more room in the comment/description box. <sub>Added Nov 12, 2023</sub></li>
</ul><p></p><h3>Reintroduce Rejection Neomails that give reason for rejection</h3>
<ul><li>These templates already exist but only 2 have seen use lately (Too Many Good Entries (TMGE), and Did not Follow Rules (only being used for incorrectly labelled collaborations). Reintroducing the full range of letters for things like "needs improvement" (eg legibility, grammar) or "did not get the joke" (for comics with an un clear premise) helps authors evaluate how to improve their work and improve their chances of getting in next time.</li>
</ul><p><sub> Dec 14, 2023</sub><strong class="imp">Improved! </strong>We're seeing some various rejection neomails come in that are already helpful! Rejections received so far include:

</p><p>
</p><table><tr><td>Your Neopian Times Submission (COMIC NAME) was rejected because it was found to be too wide. The maximum width for a comic is 470 pixels wide. If a comic is too wide and is shrunken down, the text becomes smaller and harder to read.</td>
</tr><tr><td> There were certain elements of your story that were found to be inconsistent with what users are allowed to post on the Neopets site. Please visit the Terms and Conditions page to better understand what is not allowed.</td>
</tr></table><p></p><h3>Improved Backend for Editors</h3>
<ul><li> It seems submissions regularly get lost or forgotten or don't get a chance to be seen. Improving the backend for the editors could go a long way in making competition more fair, and making the editor's job easier</li>
<li> Include a way to quickly select a rejection letter template to send for rejected entries</li>
<li> include a way to begin compiling more than one issue of the NT at a time. This would help with larger themed issues and allow people to submit earlier without their entries being lost</li>
<li> Consider using proven offsite submission systems (Controversial: Quick Easy way to improve submitting process on both ends with a proven system. Users may not want to have to go offsite to submit their work.)</li>
</ul></td></tr><tr><td>

<p>
</p><h2 id="LW">WISHLIST</h2>

<p> Lower Priority Ideas of Varying Complexities!</p>

<p></p><h3>Regular Prizes (Popular, Controversial)</h3>

<p><strong>DONE!</strong>: added as of NT 1000! All issues now award a prize from the regular creative contest prize pool. This has overall been a positive success with few of the concerns having become an issue so far as we can tell as users.
<br>Leaving this section here for now. 
Will delete the explanation text later to reduce petpage bloat. </p>

<ul><li>This has been under debate as long as there's been an NT. So far we only get prizes for special themed issues that need to be given out manually. If this was implemented it would be a major fix that would need to be automated and include collaborators in rewards</li>
</ul><table><tr><th width="50%">Pro</th>
<th width="50%">Con</th>
</tr><tr><td>
    <ul class="procon"><li>A ton of work goes into entries and artists and authors deserve some compensation for their work</li>
    <li>Would introduce more rare items into the economy</li>
    <li>Would increase participation and competition</li>
    </ul></td>

<td>
    <ul class="procon"><li>Many creators prefer the reduced pressure of not needing to write for prizes, and being able to focus on telling a story.</li>
    <li>Introducing prizes could encourage more cheating. </li>
<li> The NT is only once every other week vs other Creative Contests that are once a week or more. There's not currently enough infrastructure to support the increased competition</li>
</ul></td>
</tr></table><p>-Various NT Prize Pool Options and Variants (in no particular order):
</p><ol><li>Use the same creative contest prize pool as other contests.
   </li><li>Give a NP prize instead of item prizes. Something like 25k. A small boost but not enough to be worth cheating over. <b>Bonus:</b> Apply to all backlog NT trophies!</li>
   <li>Give the NT a unique prize pool without as many crazy expensive rewards. Include the past NT Milestone rewards other than the coin, and make the coin the standard milestone prize instead. Prize pool would need to be expanded so items don't loose their value too much.</li>
   <li>No prize pool, but give tiered rewards for the number of times you get into the NT using past milestone prizes. Example Tiers: 1: Book of ideas, 5: NT writing Quill, 10: Times Star Avy, 15: White Weewoo Plushie, 20: NT Background, 25: Postal Weewoo Action Figure, 30: Trading Card. (or some other mix thereof)</li>
</ol><p></p><h3>Increase Comic File Size (Very Popular!)</h3>
<ul><li>As tech has progressed, it's harder than ever to keep comics under 200kb. Programs favour higher resolutions, and comics often need larger writing to be legible on smaller mobile screens making them longer overall. Even a small increase (an extra 50-100kb!) would go a long way!</li>
</ul><p></p><h3>Add A Comic Series Submission Form</h3>
<ul><li>Many Comic Creators Want to tell a story all at once in multiple parts! Include a submission form similar to series for those who complete their whole work ahead of time.</li>
<li>It would be nice if these were still published on the same page as the other comics instead of being separated like written series are from shorts</li>
</ul><p></p><h3>Add A Puzzle + Games Section</h3>
<ul><li>If the NT is still accepting puzzle submissions, please consider adding a new section for puzzles separate from comics.</li>
</ul><p></p><h3>Bring Back Series "part one, part two, part three," etc. addition to series titles</h3>
<ul><li>See <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=cont&amp;week=800">issue 800 for examples</a> </li>
</ul><p></p><h3>Delete notes for editors from titles before publishing.</h3>
<ul><li>Sometimes authors leave notes for the editors in brackets in the titles. For example "(HOLIDAY)" or "(FOR HOLIDAY)". Usually these Brackets are meant as directive notes for the editor and should be deleted before publishing.
</li></ul><p></p><h3>Editorial sent box</h3>
<ul><li>Feedback system to know if your question is still in the que.</li>
</ul><p></p><h3>More Formatting Options and Helpers for submitting written works</h3><sub>added Nov 12th, 2023</sub><ul><li> If we continue using BBC with square brackets for formatting, add buttons like on the neoboards that will add the appropriate code (eg. [b]Bold Font[/b]) to help those unfamiliar with coding.</li>
<li> Add a Preview option so authors can check that their formatting is working before submitting</li>
<li> Add support for more  formatting options such as bullet points,  bullet point/number listing, strike through,  Superscript, Subscript, COLORS, font size, text alignment (also called justification), quote box, and spoiler box.</li>
<li> Have a list of what formatting options the NT will accept</li>
</ul><p></p><h3>Return to Weekly Issues</h3><sub>added Nov 22nd, 2023</sub><ul><li>If there's enough participation in the NT, please consider returning to weekly issues!</li>
</ul><p></p><h3>Larger Issues! (Popular!)</h3><sub>added Nov 22nd, 2023</sub><ul><li>With more users returning to the site, participation in the NT is going up! If the editors can manage it, it could be time to expand the size of both normal and themed NTs. This could help accommodate more of the fantastic work people are submitting, and could be done with less work than making the NT weekly again.</li>

<p></p><h3>Who's the current Editor of the NT?<sub>Updated Dec 12th, 2023</sub></h3>
<p> <a href="//www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=tnt_adler">tnt_adler</a> is currently the editor for the NT, taking over from TNT_Stone* We also know from <a href="//www.neopets.com/nf.phtml?nf_date=2023-05-01">Nosy Neopians Episode 4</a> <sub>May 2, 2023 (scroll down to may 3rd in news for the link!)</sub> that tnt goldfish (no known staff account on site) also helped Stone with the NT.
<br>tnt_stone was the previous editor and also helps with other writing and item creation on the site. Tnt's staff is smaller these days and the editors have more responsibilities than in the past when editors would focus solely on the NT. Adler is also running poetry and can be assumed to have additional responsibilities.</p>
<p class="smalltxt">* A recent neomail response from Stone explained that they've stepped back from the NT and that questions can be directed to Adler in the editorial</p>

<p></p><h3>How do I ask questions to TNT about the NT?</h3>
<p> </p><ul><li>If it's a general question (eg. What's allowed in the NT?) you should send your question in to the editorial.</li>
<li> If it's a question specific about your entry (eg. "Oops! an attached img is broken.") neomail tnt_adler. Expect slow response times. Staff are busy!<sub>Updated Dec 12th, 2023</sub></li>
</ul><p></p><h3>Can questions still be sent to NT_Editor?</h3>
<p> No. The NT_Editor account is no longer active and not in use.</p>

<p></p><h3>Is the NT every other week now? Why?</h3>
<p> Yes. The Neopian Times is published every other week now. This change was made to accommodate a smaller staff and a smaller user base. At the time this change was made participation in the NT was low, and the editors now have more responsibilities than just managing the NT and/or other creative contests.</p>
<p>I've added "Return to Weekly NTs" to the suggestions list under whishlist with the understanding that a few conditions must be met for it to be possible to return to weekly issues</p>

<p> </p><h3>Where's the submission form for the NT?</h3>
<p> Right here <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/nt_submit.phtml"> https://www.neopets.com/ntimes/nt_submit.phtml </a>
<br> You can find it at the bottom right corner of any page of the Neopian Times!</p>

<p></p><h3>When's a good time to submit to the NT?</h3>
<p> The current NT is every other week. If you are aiming to submit a work for a specific issue, do not submit until after the previous issue has been released. For example if I want to get into issue 998, I should not submit until issue 997 has been published. </p>
<p>It is not currently recommended to submit immediately after the issue comes out. The editors clear the queue/backlog after publishing each issue. If you submit too early you may accidentally be cleared with the other old entries. Wait a couple hours to be safe. Saturday and later is usually clear.</p>
<p> It is currently recommended to submit no later than Monday the week the NT publishes (4 days before the NT comes out, not counting Friday), though chances are still decent if submitting on Tuesday or very early Wednesday. Lately acceptances have finished going out by Tuesday/Wednesday. This is not a hard rule! The editors schedules change each week and sometimes acceptances are still going out Thursday/Friday. If you have an entry ready to go right before the NT is published, it's still worth submitting but your odds will be lower!</p>

<p> Submissions tend to go out in waves. There is often a wave of acceptances the first week of a cycle, then another wave the second week. Themed issues will sometimes have more waves. Issue 1000 had one wave, where they kept everything secret until right before publishing. Again, this is not a rule, just an observed pattern.</p>

<p> This is all based on personal experience and observations from the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/topic.phtml?topic=162036259"> NT submission + reply tracking</a> board on the Neopian Writers neoboard. Check in to see when people start getting their NT letters!
</p>

<p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/ntwriter.gif" width="25" height="25"></p><h3>When Can We Start Submitting for Milestone Issues?</h3>
<p> Milestone issues will have the same submission period has regular issues. DO NOT SUBMIT UNTIL THE PREVIOUS ISSUE HAS BEEN PUBLISHED UNLESS TNT SAYS THEY'RE TAKING EARLY SUBMISSIONS</p>

<p><i>I personally recommend including in the comments box your intent for the entry to be for the milestone issue. Eg. "For 1000</i> <br>This does not guarantee publishing in the milestone issue. If you decide to submit early, it's also less likely it will be published before the desired issue (but not guaranteed!)</p>
<p>See Question above for more info on submission times. Visit the Writers neoboard if you have more questions!</p>

<p></p><h3>How many times can you submit per issue?</h3>
<p>There is no official cap. But personally I would advise against more than 3-5. It can take a long time to review works. Submitting too many at once will slow down the editor more than increasing your chances.</p>

<p></p><h3>How many times per issue can you be published</h3>
<p>Only one publish per issue per person! Sometimes mistakes are made and someone might be published twice by accident.</p>

<p></p><h3>How do I add collaborators?</h3>
<p> You can have up to two other people collaborate with you on an entry (3 total!)</p>
<p> Add their names to the comment box. New rules state you must also add what they worked on. For example a comic collaboration might look like this "userA:Writer userB:Art". (the submitter should include theirselves in this list and what they did)</p>

<p></p><h3>Can I collaborate with more than one group?</h3>
<p>Each person can only be published once per issue, regardless of if they're a collab partner or the primary submitter. Collaborating with multiple groups could cause secondary groups to be disqualified from that issue because one person is being published already, and the secondary groups will need to resubmit for a later issue.</p>

<p></p><h3>What's the Great Collab?
</h3><p> The Great Collab is different than regular collaborations. They are themed issues held once a year where the theme is chosen by users. Volunteers collect the names of participants and work with the editor to get as many people published as possible. Being on the list does not guarantee publishing, and not being on the list does not exclude participants so long as they're still on theme. This was something that users started doing on their own long ago, working together to all submit something with the same topic to the same NT, and TNT eventually was kind enough to make it an official event.</p><p>
</p><p> You can still collaborate with others on your entries as usual.</p>
<p> The next Great Collab Topic is <b>Machines in Motion</b> for the NT on August 9th, 2024. The deadline to submit to the user list is July 26th, two weeks before the NT will be published. (You can still submit after that as an independent participant. Everyone will still submit through the usual submission form).</p>

<p><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/ntwriter.gif" width="25" height="25"></p><h3>How do I know my entry was submitted successfully?</h3>
<p></p><ul><li> When you first submit you will be taken to a page with blue text saying "Your entry "ENTRY NAME" has been submitted successfully</li>
<li>If you do not see this page, try resubmitting again with the EXACT SAME TITLE (Many browsers offer a drop down list of previously used titles to select from so you know it's the same) and resubmit your work. If it's in the system it will tell you, you've already submitted a work with that title</li>
</ul><p></p><h3>How come my article/story submission won't go through?</h3>
<p>If the submission form is rejecting your entry try:
</p><ul><li> Check your word count. If it's over or under it may fail to send</li>
<li> Check your HTML formatting. It should use square brackets (see 'How Do I Add Formatting' question below)</li>
<li> The filter may or may not be counting your formatting as word count. Try increasing you word count. Or decreasing if that doesn't work. </li> 
</ul><p></p><h3>How come my comic submission won't go through?</h3>
<p> There are a few common causes to a comic submission being rejected by the submission form (not by the editor)
</p><ul><li>Check the format of your image. It must be .jpg or .gif (.JPGE will NOT work!)</li>
<li>Make sure it's less than 200kb. Sometimes it will say it's 200kb but it's actually 200.1 and that's still too big. I recommend 198kb as a safe cap.</li>
<li>Make sure your comic is 470px wide or less. Occasionally the system will bug and accept the entry anyways, but it's safer to keep it 470px or under.</li>
</ul><p></p><h3>How do you compress comic size under 200kb?</h3>
<p>Try one of these guides!

</p>

<p></p><h3>I got a "Too Many good Entries" rejection neomail. What does that mean?</h3>
<p>It means what it says on the tin. There were too many good entries that issue and the editors were not able to publish them all, usually due to time, or wanting to ensure there are enough entries for the next edition too. This response is especially common if you've submitted a non-themed piece to a themed issue. If you have submitted the same work multiple times and still keep getting TMGE, consider checking over your work to see if you can improve anything, or changing the timing at which you submit the work.</p>

<p></p><h3> What does TMGE mean?</h3>
<p> TMGE means "Too Many Good Entries". It is a common neomail response when your work has been rejected. See above.</p>

<p></p><h3> What Other Rejection Neomails Are there?</h3>
<p> We recently started seeing more specific rejection neomails again. These are very helpful for identifying what needs to be fixed. Here's what we've seen so far. If you're still not sure what you did wrong, try saving your entry to a petpage and asking on the neoboards or a friend for feedback. I am looking for more of these! Let me know if you get one not on this list!</p>

<p>
</p><table><tr><td>Your Neopian Times Submission (COMIC NAME) was rejected because it was found to be too wide. The maximum width for a comic is 470 pixels wide. If a comic is too wide and is shrunken down, the text becomes smaller and harder to read.</td>
</tr><tr><td> There were certain elements of your story that were found to be inconsistent with what users are allowed to post on the Neopets site. Please visit the Terms and Conditions page to better understand what is not allowed. ***</td>
</tr></table><p> *** "there were certain elements of your story that were found to be inconsistent with what users are allowed to post on the Neopets site." could also mean you didn't list your collaborators and what they contributed in the description box when you were submitting. See above for collaboration rules. </p>

<p></p><h3>Can My Work be Held Over to a later issue?</h3>
<p> No. The NT not longer does hold overs. If you did not get into the current issue, you will have to resubmit.</p>

<p></p><h3>When Should I Resubmit?</h3>
<p> </p><ul><li>If you've received a TMGE neomail it's safe to resubmit. They may still be clearing the queue if you submit too soon though. Wait an hour after receiving the neomail to be safe.</li>
<li> If the NT you submitted to has been published, and you haven't heard anything back try resubmitting. If it tells you that an entry with that name already exists, add (RESUBMIT) to your title or change it in some other way. Wait a few hours or a day after the NT has been published before submitting. They might still be clearing the backlog.</li></ul><p></p><h3>How do I submit a thumbnail for comics?</h3>
<p> Do not use the thumbnail submission box. It is currently broken <sub>Nov 22, 2023</sub>. Instead host your thumbnail offsite. It must be 150x150px. It can be .jpg, .gif OR .png (thumbnails only! the comic itself must be jpg or gif!) Include the url link to the img in the comment box. OR post it on a petpage, preferably at the top where it is easy to find or on a page with nothing else on it. If you run out of comment space you can paste only the last part of the url containing the pet's name. EG. <b>/~bloozard</b> would be used to send the editor to this page.
</p>

<p></p><h3>How do I submit a thumbnail for Articles/Shorts/Series?</h3>
<p> Include a link to your thumbnail in the comments box. This can be an img link or a link to a petpage hosting it (make sure it's easy to find, top of the page). Same as comic thumbnails, it must be 150x150px and can be .jpg, .gif or .png.</p>

<p></p><h3>How do I add formatting to written works? (Articles, Shorts, Series)</h3><p>
</p><p>Use SQUARE BRACKETS [] for code. Still follow HTML coding rules, but replace all the angle brackets with square brackets instead. The editors will replace the brackets when publishing with html brackets.</p>

<p></p><h3>How do I add pictures to written works? (Articles, Shorts, Series)</h3>
<p> Use [img src="IMG URL HERE"] You can include images from on site, or host your own offsite and use that URL if you have an image you or your collaborator made yourselves. You may not use non-official art made by others without their permission.</p>

<p></p><h3>What's not allowed in the NT?</h3>
<p></p><ul><li> Excessive or graphic violence or bloodshed: fighting can still happen! But keep it PG!</li>
    <li>Graphic description of death. Death is hard to write for the NT. It can be done, but it must be alluded to. See <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=727">Editorial 727</a>. This is an old editorial though and the current editor may interpret the rules differently. Things like "the character died then woke up as a zombie/ghost" can be fine if it's not too detailed for instance.</li>
    <li>Romance. This rule has been relaxed recently. Romance should not be the plot of the story, but it's usually fine to refer to boyfriends, girlfriends, parents, spouse, husband, wife, etc. Some stories describing a date have made it in in recent times, without ever calling it a date.</li>
    <li>Real world brands are a no. Sometimes people will reference art programs they use for how to articles, but I can't recall to what extent they're named.</li>
    <li>Neopets are people too. They should not be depicted as mindless animals, even if they're quadrupeds or an owner's pet. They can speak and have opinions and feelings! (yes, as TNT reminds us. Even Unis acting as mounts)</li>
    <li> Species colours that don't exist on site: you can get away more with this in comics as a joke or unique character design SOMETIMES. But in general if you're writing a story, you can't have an Avocado painted Aisha, because that's not a colour option for aisha's, and you can't have a plaid painted anything because that's not a colour option.
    </li><li>Big secrets for games, avatars, hidden places, places that don't exist *cough* etc. " (direct quote from handy tips page, not sure how much this one has relaxed over the years)</li>
    <li>Discussion of scams, frozen accounts, or similar." </li> 
    <li>Anything written by anyone other than you. Please do not submit someone else's work for any reason, ever, period." (This includes AI. AI is not considered to be your own work. AI work is not allowed in creative contests)</li>
</ul><p> Also check the official <a href="//www.neopets.com/help_search.phtml?help_id=172"> Handy Tips </a> page for the neopian times!</p>

<p></p><h3>What about Technology? Is That allowed?</h3>
<p> Yes! Despite the handy tips page saying otherwise, as of <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=946">Editorial 946</a> much more technology is allowed in the neopian times! </p>

<p></p><h3>How do I submit a Comic Series?</h3>
<p> One at a time per issue using the regular comic submission form!</p>
<p> The old method for submitting comic series was to submit the whole series all at once, through the normal comic submission form. This meant each page needed it's own submission labelled Part 1,2,3, etc. The editor would then review the whole series all at once and put the extra parts on hold if it was approved.</p>
<p> Hold Overs are not currently a thing, as the backlog gets cleared after every issue, so we have to submit each new part after the previous part gets published.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that all parts will be published one after the other. You might experience some issue skips, especially for themed issues if they're too full.</p>

<p></p><h3>Are they still accepting puzzles in comics?</h3>
<p>After not being seen for months, puzzles showed up again in issue 1004, the Illusion day issue of the NT. So it would seem the puzzles are still accepted, but either fewer people have been submitting puzzles, or they've had a reduces priority when publishing, as no other have appeared since.<sub>Jun 14th, 2022</sub></p>

<p></p><h3>Can we submit from our side accounts?</h3>
<p>No, not anymore. In Editorial 777 it was stated that we could submit from side accounts for normal issues that don't award prizes. But now all issues award prizes so it can be assumed that we can no longer submit from side accounts. This has not been stated officially, but would line up with other creative contest rules. (Beauty Contest Can be submit from side accounts, but Art Gallery cannot)</p>

<p></p><h3><a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=976">Editorial 976</a></h3>
<p>Hello Neopians!</p>

<p>To help with future Neopian Times submissions we have laid out some rules that we will be going by from now on:</p>

<p>To avoid confusion, users will no longer receive messages if their entries are being held.</p>

<p>Entries will be cleared out after each edition. So if your submission was not accepted in the most recent NT, you can try revising and resubmitting for the next issue!</p>

<p>Entries can be submitted by up to 3 collaborators, however, going forward, any entries with collaborators must include a comment providing details explaining which part of the submission each person worked on.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that continued comics or shorts are not always guaranteed to be in the next edition, as they can be spread out based on which types of issues we have as well as the quality of the submission. Just because the first part was accepted, does not mean the second part will be in the next edition. If you don't see it published in the most recent edition, you can always revise and resubmit!</p>
<p>
Entries will no longer be edited after publication unless there are major input errors.</p>

<p></p><h3><a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=997">Editorial 997</a></h3>
<p><b>Hey TNT, I have a question about issue 1000. I know the usual guideline these days is to submit for the issue that is next to come out, so if we were aiming for issue 999, we would submit once issue 998 is live. But I bet you guys are expecting an absolute avalanche of issue 1000 submissions. Are there any plans to widen the submission window for issue 1000, or should we just submit after 999 is live as usual? Thanks for reading and good luck with the incoming avalanche :') ~breakingchains</b></p>
<p>
Hello! We are anticipating an increase in submissions for the 1000th issue. While you are welcome to submit beforehand, it may get mixed into normal submissions for other issues prior to the 1000th issue and be harder to filter through. We recommend submitting after the 999 issue has gone live so that it does not get lost or published beforehand. Happy writing! ~~Adler </p>

<p><b>¡Hola TNT! *les invita pastel de chocolate recién horneado* Is it allowed to send poems, articles, series or short stories in Spanish using opening and closing question marks or exclamation marks like these: "¿Cómo estás?", "¡Buenos días!" in the text for the Poetry Contest and The Neopian Times, respectively? ~frecuencialatina</b></p>
<p>
¡Hola de nuevo! While we do try to include other languages in our writing contests, our programming is still a bit old and may not recognize each and every single punctuation in multiple languages. You are more than welcome to try, we just cannot guarantee that our platform will publish it correctly if your piece is selected as a winner. I hope this helps! ¡Buenos días! ~~ Adler</p>

Hi,Of course you can mention them (this is actually the same as it's always been) but we do ask that you stay away from giving a lot of in-depth medical details (same as with any health-related conditions). ~~Kikocat</p>

<p></p><h3><a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial&amp;issue=975">Editorial 975</a></h3>
<p>(Italic words were replaced for petpage filters.)
<br><b>Hi TNT! *tosses edible cookie dough - no really, it's delicious!* I was discussing the "no romance" rule with a friend recently, and we were both a pretty confused with how it's worded in the official rules vs. in editorials. The rules only say no<i>Mature</i> content', which is an entirely separate concept from romance (see: <i>Ace (LGBTQ)</i>, which we're allowed to mention now!). Just the concept of people dating/being married/having romantic relationships is child-friendly, and kids see it happen in the real world all the time. Under the wording in the official rules, it looks like I could mention two pets/characters as "dating" (or "married", or "together") without any issue, but I know from past editorials that this isn't true at all! Could you either update the wording in the rules to make it clearer, or change the policy to allow casual and chaste mentions of romance with no <i>Mature</i> content? Thank you! :) Please remove my username. ~Anoynmous</b></p>
<p>
This is a tough one! You can, of course, mention if your pet is married, dating or in a relationship. However, you couldn't go into details about that relationship in detail or be out looking for a relationship with other pets. ~~Kikocat </p>
<p><i>PET PAGE NOTE: This rule has been relaxed in the Times with entries referring to husbands, entries including chaste Bed Sharing, entries that are obviously a wedding but never called one, and entries that are obviously a date but never called one, all getting in at various times.</i>

<p><b>Hi TNT! *hands over a slightly stale cookie* I've come back after a long hiatus and I'm excited to see the Neopian Times still running. However I was wondering, with all the changes to other newspapers over the years, if the Times could adopt some modern features? It would be great to be able to save favourite articles, search the editorial for old answers, and even have a mobile edition. Maybe a comments section and additional submission formats as well? Thanks! ~~misty_donna</b></p>
<p>
*inspects stale cookie and eats it anyway* hiya! Excited to have you back! The Neopian Times is long over due for an update and those features would be lovely. We'll add this to our to do list and look into it. ~~Sunpotato</p>

<p><b>Would y'all ever consider going back to listing "part one," "part two," etc in Neopian Times series names when we are clicking between parts? It used to be easier to navigate and now we have to count to select which part to read next. Thank you! ~~encroached</b></p>
<p>
Great idea! We will add part numbers to the titles so that the series should be easier to navigate! ~~Stone</p>

Hey Neo, I came back to the site a few weeks ago but I remember Neopian Times would be updated every Friday, is there a reason why you moved to bi-weekly updates? Cheers! ~~ivoryrosefrost</b></p>
<p>Yes, we made this change in order to best utilize our resources. With the Neopian Times now being released every other week, it has given me more time to help out in other corners of Neopia! Since this change also impacts how often Anniversary editions occur, we also decided to make every 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th issue of the Neopian Times an Anniversary Issue. This way writers and artists submitting to the Neopian Times won't have to wait too long for a chance at earning the Neopian Times Writer avatar! ~~Aesop</p>

<p><b>Hello! Since the NC Mall Usukicon capsules introduced cellphones and cars for pets this year, does that mean you'll be adjusting your guidelines about such technology in Neopian Times submissions? ~~kittyinthewater</b></p>
<p>
That is an EXCELLENT point. Neopets is ready for a technological revolution. I'm here for it. Get Nigel a real car! We'll make sure we adjust the Neopian Times submission rules, but going forward from this editorial, technology is allowed in submissions. ~~Gutterfoot</p>

<p><b>Is there any chance the New/Continued Series section could be judged more regularly? It is very disheartening to get a Too Many Good Entries rejection week after week only to discover there have been NO actual entries in that section published that week. Not to mention that the Times itself does not run every week these days. ~~herdygerdy</b></p>
<p>
There are always at least three Continued Series that are included in each edition of the Neopian Times. When one of these three series ends, another is chosen and added to the "New Series" section. Since Continued Series can run for many editions and tend to be the longest pieces of writing submitted to the Neopian Times, they require the most time to edit and set up. If we started a new series each week, the Continued Series section would fill up too quickly and be far too overwhelming for the editor. If you want to improve your chances of being accepted to the Continued Series section, I recommend paying close attention to the current running series and submitting your series once one of the ongoing Continued Series is wrapping up. We will also start holding over new series entries once the existing continued series only have a few parts left!</p>
<p><i>PETPAGE NOTE: These days we often have more than three series running! Especially after collab editions! But it is still a loosely followed pattern with series publications.</i></p>

<b>Hi. *hands Weewoo-shaped cookies* Is it possible to be accepted into a Neopian Times special edition (ending in 50 or 00) more than once? Or is each user limited to one special NT publication ever, to give others a chance? I'm curious. ~_brainchild_</b></p>
<p>
Hm, I think so. I mean...if not...that would mean I have to check through every. single. special issue. ever. That seems a bit aggressive. A user can have one per issue but numerous issues are allowed!
</p>
<p><i>PETPAGE NOTE: current editor is different but would face this same problem of needing to check each author and collaborator.</i></p>

Wow. This is amazing my oh my this cheesy goodness!!!! Hm, so I hate to put an end to collaboration because team work makes the dream work butttt I think I have a limit of 3 collaborators! Also, if that was different than before, oh well! That's my rule and I'm Queen so what I say goes :)</p>

<p><b>Hello hello! I was wondering, is it allowed to submit to the Neopian Times on side accounts? For normal issues only trophies are awarded, but some special issues (Christmas, Halloween, Collab Issues) give out prizes, and those aren't allowed to be won on side accounts. So, is it a case by case issue, or is there a clear cut rule on submissions? ~twillieblossom</b></p>
<p>
Good question!! So, for normal issues that aren't awarded any prizes you can submit from your side account. I'd say it's pretty clear cut, on regular issues you can and for special issues then it's against the rules.</p>

<p><i>PETPAGE NOTE: ALL ISSUES NOW AWARD PRIZES. It can be assumed that we can no longer submit from sides.</i></p>

I'm a frequent contributor to the Neopian Times, and thought that for my future submissions, I'd do collabs with other players. The thing is, I'm really generous, and would write 99% of the article, while the other player would submit maybe 3-4 lines. Is this considered cheating? Will the other player get in trouble with TNT if it's known that they only contributed 3-4 lines? The players that I talked to on the Help Neoboard think that my generosity veers towards helping the other player to cheat. Thanks for answering this question! ~ indulgences</b></p>
<p>
Hi, collaborators are meant to reward users who were essential to the creation of your piece. Having another user add a couple sentences to help boost their trophy count isn't what it was intended for, and we hope users won't take advantage of it by using it that way.</p>

*hands out coffee and doughnuts* On behalf of all the other neopians and I, we just want you thank for all of your hard work that you do for the Neopian Times! Do you have tips or suggestions for those still waiting on a weewoo avatar for next year? ~ marbear_4u</b></p>

<p>
*munches on doughnuts* Originality is the biggest thing I can stress. I get lots of weewoo entries for example, and most of them are good enough to be in a normal issue, so try to find an interesting angle that is different from others! Also, quality is key! Double check grammar, spelling, capitalization, width/length for comics/written pieces, etc. With so many good entries to choose from, little things like that are a quick way out.</p>

<p><b>Hello! I'm finally working on a story for the Neopian Times (yay!) and I had a question. Now, I've read the rules over and over again, but I was wondering if I could make it under the impression a character has died, and everyone else is upset for a while and they carry on until the character in question suddenly comes back, and is clearly not dead. I'm not going to make it (the "death") anything too descriptive, but I just wanted to know if it was okay in general. I'd hate to start writing it, only for it to not be allowed! Thanks, and if this gets in, please remove my username. ~ username removed</b></p>
<p>
Hi! So that should be fine, Neopets can die, but as you stated, just be sure it's not too graphic or violent, as that will cause a rejection. Looking forward to reading your story, sounds like a good one!</p>
