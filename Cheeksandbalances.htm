TPL Explained<br><br><font size="6"><font color="Black">
What is this TPL I have heard about?
<br><br><font size="4"><font color="Black">
TPL actually stands for two different things.  The first is "The People's League," and the other is "Tiny Pet League."  The idea of this league is to take an existing concept (making smaller and more accessible leagues) and bringing it to its natural, if extreme, conclusion.<br><br>
To be upfront, this started out as satire.  However, upon closer inspection it turns out that this hastily put together league actually allows for fairly deep strategy.  So, I'm making it a thing.  The build is 12 HP/1-7 Strength/13-19 Defense.  What this means is that a pet can be made from scratch and nearly be fully trained already.  You'll want to train the pet to Level 25 to have full access to abilities, however.
<br><br>
There are some weapon restrictions of which you should be aware:<br><br>
1. You can only do 14 total icons per round (full blocking is not allowed, and every icon on a shield counts towards this total).<br>
2. 6 attack icons per weapon<br>
3. 9 total icons per weapon with attack icons.<br>
4. Abilities count toward the 14 icon total.<br>
5. No Vpot/Ppot<br>
6. Healing can only be done with healers listed on this page and the ability Positive Thinking<br>
6a. No multi-healing with weapons<br>
7. No Downsize!<br>
8. When using a reflector, you may not select a Faerie Ability that round.<br><br>

There are many styles of play possible with these rules.  For example, faerie abilities can be central to your strategy, or just a fringe option you barely use.  Or perhaps you prefer Constant + Shield for most rounds; maybe dual duties are your thing.  There isn't a necessarily correct way to approach battling in TPL, as particular weapons can make or break strategies.
<br><br><font size="6"><font color="Black">
What sort of healers are worth my time?
<br><br><font size="4"><font color="Black">
The most fun metagames are those which possess a layered approach to healing.  In TPL your general options are an overheal, a full heal with defense icons, and the ability to attack while healing which comes at the cost of reliable healing.  Behold your primary healing options:<br><br><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/new_dragonstone_2.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/arm_yellow_robe.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/items/mag_adca2014_holino.gif"><br><br>
Nova and Supernova are also allowed, but their healing is less reliable.  You wouldn't want Nova anyway, compared to the other two.<br><br><font size="6"><font color="Black">Why should I bother with this pathetic league?  Also I hate you.
<br><br><font size="4"><font color="Black">Well you just got uninvited to my birthday party.  Anyway, the idea of different leagues in the new dome is to create different experiences.  You've never battled quite like this before.  Abilities aren't something tacked onto your weapon choices anymore.  They are an extension of you because it's all about the 14 icon cap.  If you use icicle, you know you have eight icons at your disposal via your weapons.  Even what constitutes a good weapon changes.  6 attack icons or 6 attack icons with 3 defense is obviously the top kind of weapon, but sometimes you need something weaker to complement your icon spread for the round.  Sometimes you won't use abilities at all.  It's a very fluid experience that doesn't really happen anywhere else.  So please, consider joining the TPL revolution.

Alternate Rules<br><br><font size="4"><font color="Black">
I won't be here forever; in fact, I'm about done with this site.  So I want to use this section to post alternate rule sets.  In general these will make the league more defensive and thus less unique compared to the other leagues.  But it's good to mix it up over time.<br><br>
The first idea is to cycle what icon types are and aren't allowed.  (This idea came from user drazu.)  For example, in the upcoming tourney, no earth or light can be used in sets.  Under this paradigm, weapons that defend those icon types won't have the defense icons count towards the 14 icon limit.  For all intents and purposes, those icon types don't exist.<br><br>
Another possibility is using the weapon Frost Healing, which heals 4 HP.  You would need to limit it somehow.  Possible limits:<br><br>
- Can only be used x times per fight<br>
- Can't be used past x round<br>
- When used, your icon limit is reduced by x<br><br><br>
Frost healing is interesting as every turn you predict it will be used, an ability metagame is created.  The opponent will probably use Icicle or Static Cling (or Halitosis or Sear) on FH turns.  You have to try to decide what they will use (or if you will even try to counter it at all).  A FH tournament has merit and allows for a different style of play.  It just needs some sort of limit.  Or possibly not, if you can reliably outdamage the heal per turn.  Worth exploring.<br><br>
One last way is to up the icon limit some, as well as possibly lowering the offensive icon limit.  For example:<br>
- 18 total icon limit per round<br>
- 10 offense icon limit <br><br>
Or you could ignore the second one.  It'd probably still be a good idea to have an attack icon limit per weapon, though.<br><br>
Just some thoughts.  Have at it!
