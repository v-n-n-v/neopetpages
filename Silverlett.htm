<div id="box"><a name="13"></a>
<h1>Sweet Happiness</h1>
<a href="/~Quinsai"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HI051.png" border="0" style="float: left; padding: 5px;"></a><p>No one knew why Ms. Waltz was always so grouchy with her students. She snapped at them whenever they made a mistake on the board, stumbled on a word during reading, remained silent during class discussions, or for fooling around.</p> <p>Allen understood the last part- no one should fool around. But for making mistakes? You can't snap at someone for doing that. It wasn't fair.</p>
<p>Like yesterday, for example, Allen stared at the word "imprudent" for the longest time when it was his turn to read a passage from their class novel. Ms. Waltz glared at him until he stuttered it out. <i>Im…im…impru…imprune…imprudent?</i></p>
<p>Ms. Waltz only grunted in approval. <i>Do you know what it means?</i></p>
<p>He did not but judging by the word, it had something to do with prunes? <i>There…there aren't any prunes left?</i></p>
<p>His classmates giggled at him. He felt his tail-tip twitch in embarrassment and he smiled sheepishly, cheekily, to try to escape Ms. Waltz's wrath. It did not work.</p>
<p><i>Imprudent means not sharing care for consequences. For example, Allen is very imprudent because he tattletales on his friends.</i></p>
<p><i>I do not!</i> he protested as his classmates started laughing. Ms. Waltz only slapped her pointer stick against her desk thrice to silence them and get their attention. She told him to continue reading and he did, thankful he did not stumble on any other words.</p>
<p>Today, after school, he decided to bake cookies for Ms. Waltz and try to cheer her up that way. That was what his mother told him: everyone deserves some sweetness in their life, including grouchy teachers like Ms. Waltz. Allen walked home determinedly, his tail flicking back and forth.</p>
<p>No one else was home when he opened the front door. He put his backpack on the couch and marched into the kitchen. He started by washing his hands and then searched every drawer and cupboard to look for a cookie sheet. His mother baked often so he knew they were somewhere. He was on his knees and on the tips of his toes trying to find it. He could not.</p>
<p><i>I'm home!</i> his mother announced from the front door. She walked into the kitchen and noticed it was starting to become messy. <i>Oh, my, look at this mess! What happened here?</i> she spotted her son's tail-tip twitching from behind the refrigerator. She let out a small gasp. <i>Allen! Get out of there at once!</i></p>
<p><i>Mama, do you know where the cookie sheets are?</i> he asked, still not moving from where he was on his paws and knees.</p>
<p><i>I will not tell you until you come out from there!</i> she said sharply. Reluctantly, Allen crawled back out and stood up in front of her. <i>Look at you! You made yourself filthy. You should wash and change into new clothes. Now, what's this about a cookie sheet?</i></p>
<p><i>I want to bake cookies for Ms. Waltz,</i> he explained. <i>She's always so grouchy so I thought sugar cookies would be good. I can't find the cookie sheet though. Do you know where they are?</i></p>
<p>His mother sighed. <i>I do, Allen, but you should wash and change. You wouldn't want dust getting into your cookies, do you? I'll clean up here," she added when he looked like he was going to protest. <i>We can bake them together.</i></i></p>
<p>Allen's tail swished happily as he turned around and ran up the stairs to his room. His mother watched briefly before turning to clean up the mess.</p>
<p>Once he returned, they started baking together. His mother taught him how to make accurate measurements and set him to mixing the dough thoroughly. She showed him how to mold the dough into whatever shape he wanted and he made smiley faces with them while she made flowers. Their cookies went on to two separate cookie sheets and entered the oven. Allen set the timer before stepping back to admire his handiwork. <i>That was fun!</i></p>
<p><i>Yes,</i> his mother agreed. She started gathering the equipment they used. <i>We should bake together more often. You have natural talent.</i></p>
<p>After a few minutes, the cookies were done. His mother's cookies, of course, were beautiful. His, on the other hand, didn't look too bad. He took out and took an experimental bite. His eyes widened in surprise. <i>Oh, no!</i></p>
<p><i>What is it?</i> his mother asked, glancing at him.
</p><p><i>I forgot to put sugar in the batter!</i> he exclaimed. <i>Look! There's no flavor at all!</i></p>
<p>His mother broke off a piece of the cookie he bit into and chewed slowly. She swallowed with a frown. <i>You're right. Don't worry- I know what we can do.</i></p>
<p>Quickly, she whipped up some whipping cream and prepared some sugar. She smeared the whipping cream on top of the cookies and sprinkled sugar on top. <i>There,</i> she said. <i>There might not be any flavor inside the cookie but there will be some sweetness.</i></p>
<p><i>Thank you, Mama!</i> Allen threw his arms around his mother. <i>You're the best.</i></p>
<p>She smiled at him. <i>Don't thank me yet. Thank me when your teacher says she likes them. When you give them to her, use both your paws, okay? That's polite.</i></p>
<p><i>I will.</i> Allen nodded. <i>She'll love them!</i>
</p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HesIdM6.png" border="0" width="500"></center>
<p>The next day, Allen carried the cookies in a small box in his paws. He entered his classroom, noticing Ms. Waltz was at her desk marking papers while muttering under her breath. He approached her. <i>Good morning, Ms. Waltz!</i> he chirped. <i>I have something to give you.</i></p>
<p><i>What is it?</i> she asked irritably, looking up at him. He handed her the box with two paws. <i>What's this?</i></p>
<p><i>They're cookies,</i> he answered proudly. <i>My mother and I made them together.</i></p>
<p>Ms. Waltz stared at him suspiciously. She accepted the box and pried the lid off carefully. She took one flower-shaped cookie and examined it carefully. She took a careful bite and chewed slowly. Allen watched her swallow just as slowly, her eyes never leaving his. <i>A bit too sweet,</i> she grunted, <i>but good. Thank you.</i></p>
<p><i>You're welcome!</i> Allen smiled at her, unable to contain his happiness. He went to sit down at his desk just as the bell rang to signal the start of the day.</p>
<p>He noticed his teacher did not snap as much as she usually did and actually corrected someone when they stumbled on a word. She praised them for their correct work for the math problems they did on the board and gently reminded her students when they left a mess behind after they finished painting. Although she still looked grouchy, she sounded sweeter and friendlier. It was probably because of the cookies Allen gave her and because the act had touched her to make her believe not all children were bad after all.</p>

<h1>Lost Treasure</h1>
<a href="/~Quinsai"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4bAYx.png" border="0" style="float: left; padding: 5px;"></a><p><i>Where did I put that notebook?</i> Amelie asked herself irritably. She glanced at her messy desk, then at her unkempt bed, and finally her littered floor. She flicked her tail impatiently and started rifling through her closet. Clothes, trinkets, and books flew all over the place as she tore the space apart.</p>
<p><i>Amelie! What do you think you're doing?</i> her mother demanded. Amelie looked up and saw her mother's tail-tip twitch with frustration. <i>How many times did I tell you to keep your room neat and tidy? Just look at this! It looks like a tornado came through here.</i></p>
<p>Amelie shook her head, knowing very well her mother was only teasing. <i>Mom, I'm looking for my notebook. It's green and has a Kau on it. Have you seen it?</i></p>
<p><i>No,</i> her mother answered sharply. <i>You have so many notebooks! Do you think I would know where you put it? Clean your room and look for it yourself!</i> she turned and stormed back down the hallway and down the stairs, leaving Amelie alone.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Amelie finished examining her closet and then started putting everything back the way she had found it. She found old clothes that didn't fit her anymore and an old trophy from when her school Yooyuball team won city finals. She placed that on her desk so she wouldn't lose it. It fell over because there wasn't enough room on it. With a sigh, she stood up and started cleaning that as well.</p>
<p>There was just too much junk in her room! Amelie ran down the stairs and into the kitchen where her mother was preparing dinner. <i>Mom, do you have any boxes I can use?</i></p>
<p>Her mother's tail pointed to the storage at the end of the hallway passed the staircase. <i>Thanks!</i> Amelie hurried toward it and took out as many boxes as she could carry at once. She dropped them outside her door and placed one on the floor of her room. She started piling unwanted belongings into it.</p>
<p>Eventually, the amount of junk slowly dwindled down to random piles scattered around her room. She taped boxes shut and carried them outside, exchanging it with another box. She found old photos from when she first started school, photos of her friends and family, photos of her favorite Yooyuball athletes from Teams Brightvale and Maraqua. She put those in a separate box.</p>
<p>She found a case that was heavy and small. She pried it open, realizing there was a pair of glasses sitting inside a wrap of cloth. When did those get in there? Then she remembered they belonged to her mother, who had lost them last week. She probably set them down when delivering laundry in Amelie's room and forgot where she put them. Amelie placed it on her table.</p>
<p>Next she came across her younger brother Rex's favorite Judge Hog action figure. He had cried when he lost it and she had promised him she would find it for him. She smiled when she placed it beside her mother's glasses case. That was one promise fulfilled.</p>
<p>As she continued cleaning, she found more items her family had lost over the years- her father's best pens, her mother's oldest sweater, her brother's coloring book, and even her aunt's scarf. How did they all end up in her room, though? Amelie guessed it was because it was so messy no one would think to look in the mess to try to find it again. It could take hours.</p>
<p>Amelie ran out of boxes to use. She went downstairs to get some more. Her floor was cleared, her closet was organized, and her desk was clean. The last thing that needed clearing was her bed.</p>
<p>First, she folded her blanket. She struggled to match the corners with each other so she gave up and rolled it into a messy pile. She tossed her pajamas in her laundry hamper and gently placed her Brightvale Altador Cup Team Yooyu Plushie onto her desk. She placed her pillow on her chair and then proceeded to going through the pile of notebooks, books, papers, and cases on the corner of the bed.</p>
<p>She found all her old notebooks. She used them to take notes in school, write short stories, and sometimes complained about her family. She flipped through one of them briefly, cringing at how big her writing was. Fortunately, she no longer wrote like that but reading through them was always a treat. She placed them on her desk, stacked neatly on top of each other.</p>
<p>A few old photos were also hidden in the pile. Most of them were photos from the last summer holiday when her family traveled to Brightvale and she had the chance to meet with the Yooyuball team. She placed those on her desk as well.</p>
<p>Once everything was cleared, she replaced the bed sheets with new ones, throwing the old ones in her laundry hamper as well. She put her pillow and plushie back and found new places for her notebooks and photos. With a breath of relief, she sat down in front of her desk and looked down.</p>
<p>The items she found in the mess were sitting on top of her green notebook- the one she supposedly lost. She suppressed a chuckle but ended up bursting into laughter. She went through all that for no reason but she was grateful she did. If she didn't, she wouldn't have found anything, especially not her family's lost items. She scooped up the items and left her room, her tail swishing back and forth with happiness as she went to deliver them.</p>

<h1>Plant Life</h1>
<a href="/~baline"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SSgQsVb.png" border="0" style="float: left; padding: 5px;"></a><p>I want a Petpet of my own. I really do. All of my friends have one. They always plan tea parties without me because I don't have one. It makes me feel sad but my mama says I can't have one yet. I don't know why. When I ask her, she doesn't tell me. She just flicks her tail and tries to shoo me away. I only got an answer from her once.</p>
<p><i>If you can prove to me you can take care of a Petpet then I'll let you have one. Until then, don't ask.</i></p>
<p>So I tried to be the most responsible pet she has ever seen. I saw her hide smiles when I offer to wash the dishes after dinner, to water her plants when she's busy, to babysit my younger brother when she has to go somewhere.</p>
<p>Then, one day, she beckons me to her with the tip of her tail and I leave my homework on the table and bound toward her. Sitting on the kitchen table is a Mystery Island Plant. It looks beautiful, three stems snaking up from the bed of soil with lush green leaves sticking out. I touch it gingerly, surprised to feel how soft it is.</p>
<p><i>You're a very responsible young girl, Katy,</i> my mama tells me, <i>so you're ready to learn how to take care of something else. I want you to watch this plant and treat it like a Petpet. If I think you can do that properly, then I'll let you have a Petpet. Is that okay?</i></p>
<p>I nod solemnly. I sit down in front of the plant and stare at it. <i>Can I give it a name?</i></p>
<p>My mama nods and I pause to think of a name. Only one comes to mind. <i>Charley.</i> It is the name I want to give to my real Petpet but I can think of another.</p>
<p><i>Charley.</i> My mama sounds pleased. <i>He's your to take care of now, Katy.</i></p>
<p>She helps me carry him into my room and put him down. I open the blinds a bit so Charley can get some fresh air. I go back downstairs to get my homework and come back so I can do it with him watching me.</p>
<p>It's almost bedtime now. I touch Charley's soil and my paw comes back dry. I go to the kitchen and use a cup to get some water for him. I sprinkle it over his leaves and soil. He feels moister now. I smile and tuck myself into bed. My mama turns the lights off for me after I drift to sleep.</p>
<p>The next morning, I check Charley again. His soil is still damp so I leave him alone. I remember to open the window for him and turn the lights off. I scamper downstairs to get breakfast with my mama and baby brother.</p>
<p>My friends ask me if I have a Petpet and I reply no, I have a plant named Charley instead. They tease me but I try not to let their words get to me. I try to forget about them and play with someone else. I hurry home after school.</p>
<p><i>Hi, Mama!</i> I chirp when I enter our neohome. My mama is in the kitchen cooking and my baby brother is playing with his blocks in the living room. I drop my backpack off and join him. He is happy to play with me.</p>
<p>After we eat dinner, I do my homework. My mama helps me and keeps a wary eye on my baby brother, who is trying to build something that touches the ceiling. He almost falls from standing on top of three chairs stacked on top of each other and my mama catches him. She scolds him and he complains about never being able to do anything fun. I hide a smile and promises to take him biking one day. He lights up right away.</p>
<p>I enter my room, ready to go to bed. I notice Charley and water him before moving him onto my table. I tuck myself again and go to sleep.</p>
<p>The same thing happens at school. My friends tease me so I play with someone else. They make jokes about Charley, saying he isn't real and he isn't a Petpet. I ignore them again. At home, I watch Charley for a bit and then go back downstairs to play with my baby brother. I notice Charley is growing a bit.</p>
<p>Then, the next day, one of my friends comes to school crying. I ask her if something is wrong and she, in between sobs, tells us her Angelpuss had disappeared during the night. My teacher calms her. The rest of my friends are panicking. Only I remain calm. I don't have a Petpet to worry about, only Charley and I know Charley won't run away from me. But he can rot and decay. I realize with a pang of guilt that I haven't been taking care of him as I should.</p>
<p>I go to the library after school and find books about plants. I choose a few and borrow them. At night, my baby brother asks me to play with him but I shake my head and tell him I have to finish reading. He is disappointed but doesn't say anything else. I go to my room to finish reading.</p>
<p>Charley doesn't greet me but I greet him. I examine him as I read and learn when to water him, where to put him to get the most sunlight from inside my room and the type of nutrients he needs. I'm happy to oblige.</p>
<p>My mama enters my room but stops short when she sees me reading a book and watching Charley. She is about to tell me something but she doesn't. She goes back out of my room and hides a smile. I turn my head in time to see it before she vanishes behind the wall. Her tail is curled with approval.</p>

<h1>The Counting Jar</h1>
<a href="/~quinsai"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EBbwZ.png" border="0" style="float: left; padding: 5px;"></a><p>There it sat in the display case. It sparkled beneath the fluorescent lights at the top of the ceiling inside the shop, making the red paint gleam. Aidan pressed his paws against the glass that separated him from the item he so desperately wanted. He pressed his face against the glass, his eyes staring at the item, his mind drifting off to his fantasy. But then, it was snatched away from him so quickly as his mother started dragging him away from the Toy Shop. He started whining.</p>
<p><i>But Mama, why can't I have it?</i> he whined. As his mother dragged him further away, the item in the display window vanished from his sight.</p>
<p>She let out a sigh of exasperation. She had heard her son whine for days about it but her answer was firm. <i>No means no, Aidan. You have lots of toys at home. You don't need another one.</i></p>
<p><i>Everyone at school has one, Mama,</i> Aidan pouted. <i>I want one too!</i></p>
<p><i>It's too expensive, Aidan. Maybe another time. You know we don't have the same Neopoints as your friends,</i> his mother reminded him.</p>
<p>Aidan started stomping his feet. <i>But Mama…!</i></p>
<p>His mother began to tug on his tail even harder. <i>Young Xweetok, behave yourself this instant or you won't see another toy ever again.</i></p>
<p>That made him quiet- even if it was for a few minutes. They entered their neohome, his mother locking the door behind her while her son ran into the living room where his father would be. <i>Papa! Papa!</i> he called out. <i>Mama won't let me buy it!</i></p>
<p>Lazily striding into the living room was Aidan's father, a green Xweetok with a pair of glasses balanced at the tip of his nose. He sat down on the couch and picked up a discarded edition of the Neopian Times beside him and watched his son jump up and down in indignation. <i>Can't you buy it for me instead, Papa?</i> he pleaded.</p>
<p>His father exchanged looks with his mother but she shook her head and disappeared into the kitchen to prepare for dinner. Their conversation lingered over her.</p>
<p><i>Why do you want one so badly?</i> his father was asking. <i>What about the one I bought you a few weeks ago?</i></p>
<p><i>That was old!</i> Aidan snorted. <i>Now everyone's moved on to the new one! I want it too! It's really cool and all of my friends have one so I want one too.</i></p>
<p>His father swished his tail against the couch. <i>Hmmm. I don't know what new-fangled toys you kids play these days. Be patient and wait until we have some more Neopoints than before, okay?</i></p>
<p>Sullenly, Aidan walked up the stairs to his bedroom with his tail trailing over the staircase. His father entered the kitchen and sat down. <i>What are we going to do about him?</i></p>
<p>The movements of his wife slowed down as her mind worked for a solution. <i>I think I know what to do. It's about time to see if he's capable of being responsible…</i></p>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HesIdM6.png" border="0" width="500"></center>
<p>That night, before Aidan was put to bed, his mother entered his bedroom holding a jar. It was taped with construction paper, including the bottom. He watched in wonderment as she placed it on top of his table at patted the top of it. <i>Aidan, if you really want that toy, you need to show your papa and me that you deserve it.</i></p>
<p><i>What's that for?</i> he asked curiously. He reached out to touch it but his mother slid the jar away from his curious paw.</p>
<p><i>Whenever your father or I see you do a good deed around our neohome or at school, we'll put a star in the jar.</i> His mother showed him a paper cut-out of a star. <i>It'll slip into the jar from the top. Each star is worth ten Neopoints.</i></p>
<p>Aidan tipped his head to the side. <i>How do I know if there's enough to buy it?</i></p>
<p><i>That's up to you,</i> his mother answered. <i>If you don't have enough though, your papa and I will take away what you earned and then the jar will be empty again.</i></p>
<p><i>Then I can never buy it,</i> Aidan pointed out with a frown.</p>
<p>His mother shook her head. <i>No, if you wait long enough then you might have enough. We can add one star in the jar if you go to sleep.</i></p>
<p>Scrambling back into bed, Aidan threw his blanket over him and closed his eyes. With a smile, his mother turned the light off. <i>Good night, Aidan.</i></p>
<p><i>Good night, Mama.</i> At his farewell, she slipped the star into the jar and closed the door behind her as she exited his room.</p>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HesIdM6.png" border="0" width="500"></center>
<p>The next morning, Aidan awoke on his own, tossing his pajamas on his bed and changing into his school clothes. Before he could run out of his bedroom, his mother stopped him.</p>
<p><i>Good morning, Aidan,</i> she said cheerfully. She glanced over him to see his messy bed. <i>Is that how a good pet makes his bed?</i></p>
<p>Aidan opened his mouth to protest but then his eyes focused on the jar on his table. He nodded, turned around and started making his bed. He smoothed out his blanket, folded his pajamas and set them aside and placed his Snow Yooyu Plushie in front of his pillow. He marched out of his bedroom, looking over his shoulder to see his mother deposit a star in the jar.</p>
<p>At the breakfast table, when he finished eating, he volunteered to wash the dishes without his father prompting him. With raised eyebrows and a shrug, his father sat at the table with the newest edition of the Neopian Times while his son scrubbed plates and cutlery. He walked to school with his mother beside him.</p>
<p>He was unsure how his mother knew if he was well-behaved in school or not but he made himself promise to not get into any mischief that day. When he left school at the end of the day, his teacher was chatting with his mother happily. He bounced on his toes when his mother returned to his side with a smile.</p>
<p><i>It looks like you were very good today, Aidan,</i> she remarked.</p>
<p><i>Uh-huh,</i> he nodded proudly.</p>
<p><i>Do you think you can keep that up every day?</i></p>
<p><i>Sure!</i> He was willing to do whatever was needed to buy his toy, after all.</p>
<p>That night, before dinner, Aidan and his father puzzled out his math homework together and ate with his mother when she finished cooking. He volunteered again to wash the dishes so his mother could clean the kitchen and his father could finish constructing his table to be sold at the Furniture Shop the next day. When Aidan finished, he continued doing his homework and read alongside his mother. He didn't complain at all when it was time for bed.</p>
<p>Alone in his room, he did everything he could to figure out how many stars he had earned that day. He shook it but there was no noise- the stars were made of paper. He tried looking for holes in the construction paper surrounding the jar but his mother did a very good job covering every visible bit. With a defeated shake of his head, he put the jar back down and crawled into bed, holding his plushie in his arms. I'll get enough for that toy, he promised himself. Closing his eyes, he drifted off to sleep.</p>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HesIdM6.png" border="0" width="500"></center>
<p>For the next three weeks, Aidan continued volunteering to wash the dishes after every meal, held a respectful and positive attitude at school and listened to his parents whenever they told him to do something. The thought of his toy was pushed to the back of his mind when he realized he had a project for school and it required a lot of attention. He didn't even notice the jar was missing on the morning of the third week when he climbed out of bed, tidied it and changed into his school clothes.</p>
<p><i>How are you, Aidan?</i> His father asked him at the breakfast table.</p>
<p>Aidan gave his father a toothy grin. <i>Good. How about you?</i></p>
<p><i>I'm good as well, thank you,</i> his father answered. He scanned an article printed on the first page of the Neopian Times. <i>Do you have everything with you for today?</i></p>
<p><i>Yep!</i> Aidan nodded. He went through his mental checklist, remembering he put his project materials in his backpack the night before. <i>I put them in my backpack before bed.</i></p>
<p>His mother smiled at him. <i>That's good. You better hurry and finish your breakfast then.</i></p>
<p>He nodded and continued eating. Once he finished, he placed his bowl in the sink and hurried out. <i>I'll be right back!</i></p>
<p>Both of his parents watched him hurry out of the kitchen, his thudding footsteps echoing hollowly. They exchanged looks with each other. <i>Where did you put the jar?</i> his father asked.</p>
<p>Mischief gleamed in his mother's eyes as well as in her smile. <i>I put it back in his room when he left. I was wondering to think he forgot about it.</i></p>
<p><i>Nope! I didn't!</i> Aidan's voice startled her. She turned her head, seeing her son holding the jar in his paws. He placed it on the table. <i>I don't know how many stars are in there or if it's enough to buy me that toy but it's okay. I don't really want it anymore.</i></p>
<p>Silence met his words. His father asked, <i>Why not? You wanted one really badly not so long ago.</i></p>
<p><i>I know,</i> Aidan replied. <i>But I already have so many toys. I don't need another one. And…helping out is fun too. I don't need to count how many stars I have to make me feel better. I have enough.</i></p>
<p><i>Well,</i> his father said, looking pleased, <i>should we count how many stars are in there anyway?</i></p>
<p>His mother took the lid off the jar and started counting the stars. There were over a hundred stars in the jar, totaling to about one thousand Neopoints. <i>That's quite a lot of Neopoints, Aidan. You can buy a lot of toys with that.</i></p>
<p><i>No, thanks, Mama,</i> Aidan shook his head. <i>I'm fine with what I have. You and Papa can use those Neopoints for something else. It's almost time to go,</i> he added. <i>Do you want me to wash the dishes, Papa?</i></p>
<p>Standing up, his father shook his head. <i>No, son, you better get going. I can do them today. Are you sure you don't want to spend it?</i></p>
<p>Aidan started walking out of the kitchen. <i>Nope! It doesn't matter how many stars I have. I have lots of toys and parents. That's all I need.</i> He hurried back upstairs to grab his possessions.</p>
<p>His parents exchanged looks once again but both shared a smile. His mother exited the kitchen to walk her son to school while his father washed their morning dishes. If counting stars managed to make Aidan see what he has and doesn't have, then his parents could do the same as well.</p>
<p>His father wiped his paws dry on a dishcloth and put the paper stars back in the jar, twisted the lid shut on top and placed it on the shelf. He scribbled the words "Counting Jar" on it as a reminder to him and his family that good discipline can often lead to good outcomes.</p>

<h1>A Pile of Leaves</h1>
<a href="/~farbalin"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3chmVPO.png" border="0" style="float: left; padding: 5px;"></a><p><i>Yahoo!</i> along with his rake, Ron jumped tail-first into a gigantic pile of red and golden leaves sitting on his neohome's front lawn. He used his paws and rake to pat away the leaves, resurfacing with a toothy grin. Unfortunately, his older brother Mike didn't find him very funny.</p>
<p><i>Why did you have to do that?</i> he frowned and pulled on Ron's tail to drag him out. <i>That took me hours to rake and pile up!</i></p>
<p><i>Hey! Stop pulling!</i> Ron complained as he jerked his tail away. He curled it up to prevent his brother's muddy paws from pulling on it again. <i>I was just trying to have some fun!</i></p>
<p>Mike gave him a long look and then started to rake the leaves again. <i>Well, go have fun somewhere else. I have work to do.</i></p>
<p>His younger brother started bouncing with indignation. <i>I'm supposed to be helping you too, you know!</i></p>
<p><i>Then stop fooling around and start raking!</i> Mike shouted. He realized a few seconds later that his voice still echoed throughout the empty neighborhood. He looked down at Ron, whose head was down and tail had drooped. <i>Sorry. I didn't mean to yell. I just want to go back in and finish my homework, you know?</i></p>
<p>Ron's head snapped back up. <i>All you care about is work, work, work! Haven't you ever had any real fun?</i></p>
<p>Mike stopped raking to look over his shoulder at the red Meerca. <i>What counts as fun?</i></p>
<p><i>I don't know…playing with a ball? Playing with friends?</i></p>
<p><i>Does jumping into a pile of leaves count as fun?</i></p>
<p><i>Yes!</i> Ron started bouncing again. He stopped for a minute to use his long tail to drag in loose leaves into his miniature pile. <i>Here, watch me!</i></p>
<p>The cloud Kyrii sighed and turned around. Ron bounced a few feet away from his pile of leaves, dropped down to his feet and ran toward the pile. He jumped slightly and landed on his back to the leaves. He stood up again, shaking off wet and crinkly leaves that were stuck to his jacket. <i>See? Doesn't that look fun?</i></p>
<p><i>No,</i> Mike answered. He turned back to his work, hearing his brother raking once again. <i>Why do you have to act like such a kid?</i></p>
<p><i>Uh…because I am one?</i> Ron answered questioningly. <i>I'm only eight years old. Kids like me need to have a lot of fun!</i></p>
<p>Mike slowed down his raking to figure out if his brother's comment meant older pets like him and his parents needed to have lots of work to do. Ron took Mike's silence as a sign and quickly said, <i>I-I mean, you can have fun too! Lots and lots of fun!</i></p>
<p><i>I'd rather not.</i> Mike quickly shook himself to bring back his original focus on his task. <i>If you have too much fun, you'll get bored. When you're bored, you'll start complaining. Hurry up and help me finish raking.</i></p>
<p>Ron nodded and brought his piles to Mike's to make a single large one. <i>You can never get bored of having fun. If you're having fun, you're having fun. You shouldn't have to worry about anything else. Like jumping into a pile of leaves- that's fun, right?</i></p>
<p>His older brother rolled his eyes. <i>No. I don't want to smell like rain and mud all day, thank you very much, nor have leaves caught in my fur. It'll be a pain to untangle them.</i></p>
<p> <i>You know that I think, Mike?</i> Ron asked suddenly.</p>
<p><i>What?</i> Mike tried to turn his back to rake more leaves up but his brother scurried into his vision.</p>
<p><i>I think you care too much about working and about how you look. Right?</i></p>
<p><i>Ron, I don't care about how I look but I do care about working. Working is how you get good grades and if you get good grades, Mom and Dad will give you what you want for the Day of Giving.</i></p>
<p><i>If you don't care about your looks, then jump in a pile of leaves!</i> Ron gestured to the pile both of them had created. <i>No one is here to watch you anyway!</i></p>
<p>Mike wished his brother would be quiet. He would've been done a long time ago if it weren't for his brother jumping in his pile of leaves the first time. He didn't say anything in response but focused on his task instead.</p>
<p>Slowly, the two brothers managed to create one gigantic pile on the side of their front yard. The grass was clear from all the red and golden leaves that had spiraled down from the looming trees. Mike was about to call it a day but Ron started tugging on his jacket sleeve before he could run back in.</p>
<p><i>What?</i> he looked down into his brother's big, pleading eyes.</p>
<p><i>Can I jump in it, Mike?</i> he asked hopefully. <i>Please? I'll let you have my slice of cake tonight.</i></p>
<p><i>No.</i> Mike started walking toward the front door but Ron kept after him.</p>
<p><i>Please, please, please? I swear I'll clean it all up again!</i></p>
<p><i>No is no, Ron. Let's go back in before it gets dark out.</i></p>
<p><i>It's still light out,</i> Ron pointed out. He carefully watched his brother's face. <i>Come on, Mike…I know you want to jump in it as much as I do.</i></p>
<p>That got his brother. Mike whirled around, glaring at Ron. <i>What? No, I don't!</i></p>
<p>Rather than flinching, Ron grinned. <i>Ah-ha! I know you want to! If you didn't want you, you would've went inside by now! Am I right or am I right?</i></p>
<p>Mike sighed. <i>Okay, okay, fine. Go jump in the pile and have fun cleaning it up all by yourself. I'm going to finish my homework.</i></p>
<p><i>No.</i> Ron started tugging on his brother's jacket sleeve again. <i>I want you to jump in with me.</i></p>
<p><i>What? Why?</i> Mike groaned. He knew he wouldn't be able to get out of this one.</p>
<p><i>Because you're my brother. And because I don't think you ever jumped in a pile of leaves before,</i> Ron explained with a mischievous grin. <i>Let's go! We'll jump in together! I'll even hold your hand!</i></p>
<p>His brother quickly shook his head. <i>No! I'm not a baby!</i></p>
Slowly, they approached the pile of leaves. Ron stopped a few feet in front of it like before and glanced at his brother. <i>Ready?</i>
<p><i>Yeah.</i> Mike tried to sound unenthusiastic but it didn't seem to fool Ron.</p>
<p><i>Okay! On the count of three! One…two…three!</i> together, they took three steps and leaped into the leaves, landing on them as if it weren't a soft cushion. Mike felt himself fall and then spring back up. He jumped out of the pile, kicking leaves up as he went and grabbed his brother's paw to help him out. Both of them looked at each other and laughed.</p>
<p><i>That was fun, right?</i> Ron asked with a grin.</p>
<p>Mike laughed again. <i>Yeah! That was pretty exciting!</i></p>
<p>Ron started bouncing with happiness again. <i>Yay! Let's do it again!</i></p>
<p><i>No way, Ron.</i> Mike picked up his rake and handed the other to Ron. <i>It'll be dark soon. Besides, we don't want Dad to see that we didn't do anything yet. How about we rake them all up and then do it again tomorrow morning?</i></p>
<p><i>Yeah! That sounds like a great idea!</i> Ron shouted. He quickly and excitedly raked up as many leaves as he could with his brother watching.</p>
<p>Mike smiled, glad that he managed to experience something as simple as jumping into a pile of leaves before he considered it <i>too childish</i>. Along with his rake, he joined Ron in cleaning the rest of the front yard while a fresh wave of leaves rained down on them.</p>

<h1>An Evening with Teo</h1>
<a href="/~Bhiryn"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TozvNY5.jpg" border="0" style="float: left; padding: 5px;"></a><p><i>Hurry up, Ilsa! You do know what will happen if we're late, right?</i> Fiorina whirled around and started to jog backward while watching a giant red Ixi charge toward her. <i>Captain is expecting us right now!</i></p>
<p>Ilsa grumbled under his breath as he caught up to his teammate. <i>I'm coming, I'm coming.</i> Together, they jogged up a small hill to reach a lonely neohome sitting at the top. He pounded his fist against the door. <i>Wizard? We're here.</i></p>
<p>The door opened and their team captain greeted them with a nod. <i>Thanks for coming, you two,</i> he said with relief. <i>Come in and meet Teo.</i></p>
<p>Fiorina vaguely recalled that name from a memory too long ago to remember. <i>Teo…who is that?</i></p>
<p>Wizard motioned them inside. <i>I'll explain. I have to go soon but you guys need to know a few things.</i></p>
<p>Ilsa closed the door behind him and turned to his captain, giving him a look. <i>So? What's so important that you had to call both me and her here?</i></p>
<p><i>I just got a neomail about an important meeting at the Meridell castle,</i> Wizard began, <i>but I have to watch Teo for my aunt. Can you two look after him while I'm gone? It'll only be a short while, I promise.</i></p>
<p><i>Of course we can,</i> Fiorina answered before Ilsa could protest. She nudged him with her elbow. <i>You go ahead and go to the meeting- little Teo is no match for the best Yooyuball players in Meridell.</i></p>
<p><i>Thank you.</i> Wizard smiled. <i>He's very friendly so you won't have any trouble getting him to listen to you. He should know you after all this time. Send me a neomail if you're in trouble but I don't think that'd be necessary.</i></p>
<p>Fiorina opened the door for her captain to leave the neohome. <i>Of course it won't be. Have fun, okay? We'll see you later!</i> she closed it shut and turned to Ilsa, who gave her an incredulous look. <i>What? Captain deserves a break once in a while. He's King Skarl's favorite Techo.</i></p>
<p>Ilsa rolled his eyes. <i>Whatever. Let's go find little Teo and see if he actually is very little.</i></p>
<p>They searched the living room, looking underneath couches and armchairs, behind closets and inside drawers. After exchanging confused looks with one another, Ilsa climbed the stairs to look on the second floor and Fiorina searched the kitchen. Ten minutes passed but neither of them could find Teo.</p>
<p><i>Huh.</i> Ilsa scratched his head, clearly confused. <i>Where'd he go?</i></p>
<p>Fiorina anxiously scanned the living room one more time and then looked at her teammate. <i>This is bad. We might have to call for back-up.</i></p>
<p><i>Normally, pride would have me say no but I agree this time around. I'll go send a neomail to Yoris.</i> Before Ilsa could head upstairs to borrow Wizard's neomail, Fiorina stopped him.</p>
<p><i>Why Yoris? Would Ethel be a better choice?</i> the elderly Ixi was the newest member on their team and she had a strange charm when it came to children. <i>I don't think she'd be busy today since-</i></p>
<p><i>No, Yoris would be better,</i> Ilsa argued, cutting her off. <i>He knows what Teo looks like; Ethel doesn't and neither do we.</i></p>
<p>His teammate tapped her chin. <i>I remember seeing Teo before but I can't remember what he looks like or what species he is.</i></p>
<p><i>Well, while you do that, I'm going to get Yoris.</i> Ilsa thundered up the staircase. <i>He'll be here soon…unless he rolls down the hill like last time.</i></p>
<p>Fortunately, Team Meridell's goalkeeper didn't roll down the hill and arrived within ten minutes. Yoris looked at Fiorina in surprise. <i>Oh, you're helping Ilsa out, Fiorina? I thought you were busy.</i></p>
<p>She rolled her eyes. <i>When your Captain sends you an urgent neomail telling you to go to his neohome right away, you would cancel all plans and go, right?</i></p>
<p><i>You're very loyal to Wiz, you know,</i> Yoris commented before looking around. <i>So, what are we doing again? Finding Teo?</i></p>
<p><i>Right.</i> Ilsa nodded. <i>You should know what he looks like.</i></p>
<p><i>Uh-huh.</i> Yoris headed upstairs. <i>He's a baby Draik, so very tiny and can easily hide in small places. I'll look upstairs- you check out here.</i></p>
<p>Fiorina stopped him. <i>We already searched the neohome. He's nowhere to be found.</i></p>
<p><i>Didn't you see him when Captain Wiz introduced him to you?</i> Yoris hopped back down to them.</p>
<p>Ilsa shook his head. <i>No, we didn't even see him. I guess he thought Teo was just playing but this isn't funny anymore.</i></p>
<p><i>Teo?</i> Fiorina raised her voice in an attempt to lure out the elusive baby Draik. <i>Are you here? Come out wherever you are, this isn't funny anymore!</i></p>
<p>Silence answered her. She expected it since Teo was a child and knew nothing more than playing jokes on serious adults. <i>Now what? I still think we should call Ethel.</i></p>
<p><i>Come on, Yoris, you've got some brilliant plan in that tiny of head of yours, don't you?</i> Ilsa picked up the goalkeeper from the floor. <i>You're the biggest know-it-all in Meridell.</i></p>
<p>Yoris shot Ilsa a look for him to be released. The defender obeyed and the JubJub landed on the floor. <i>First off, Captain Wiz and the nobles at the castle are the know-it-alls. Second, I know nothing about children. I just happen to know Teo because he came over to my neohome with the Captain after practice one day.</i></p>
<p>Fiorina shook her head. <i>That does it, I'm calling Ethel. I know you don't like her, Ilsa, but she knows more about children than we ever would.</i> She ran upstairs before her teammates could protest.</p>
<p>Ethel arrived ten minutes later. Fiorina and Ilsa took turns explaining to her what had happened and she quickly stepped into action. <i>Ah, young'uns, so good at Yooyuball but not good at finding children,</i> she said in her elderly voice. <i>Tell me- on the Yooyuball field, what do you do to get the yooyu away from net?</i></p>
<p>Her teammates exchanged confused looks with one another. <i>Uh…I'd steal the yooyu?</i> Ilsa suggested. <i>Pass it to Fiorina? Who'll pass it to Wizard and he'll shoot so fast the other team wouldn't even notice?</i></p>
<p><i>Maybe. You're close though.</i> Ethel was talking in riddles. <i>What would you do if you had a trap for them to fall into?</i></p>
<p><i>Um…lure them into the trap?</i> Fiorina tried to recall a few strategies they had prepared for the Altador Cup. She couldn't remember any.</p>
<p><i>Exactly, my dear.</i> Ethel smiled at Fiorina. <i>That's what we have to do. Help me out in the kitchen, darling. The boys can wait in here.</i></p>
<p>She pulled Fiorina into the kitchen without giving Ilsa or Yoris another look. All of them were confused but obeyed the elderly Ixi's order.</p>
<p>An hour later, a freshly baked pie was sitting on the table in the kitchen. Ilsa's mouth watered at the scent and Yoris jumped onto the table to smell it. <i>Mmmm…that smells good.</i></p>
<p><i>It's not for you, sonny,</i> Ethel said, pushing the pie away from Yoris. <i>It's for Teo.</i></p>
<p>As if on cue, a small baby Draik darted from underneath the couch and ran into the kitchen, stopping front of Ethel. <i>For me?</i> he asked with hopeful eyes.</p>
<p><i>Yes, dear.</i> Ethel scratched his head. <i>Eat up, sonny. Why don't you tell us why you were hiding this whole time?</i></p>
<p><i>Thought it was fun,</i> Teo said in between mouthfuls. <i>Playing jokes is fun.</i></p>
<p><i>Well, Teo, playing jokes on these lovely friends of Wizard's isn't very fun,</i> Ethel told him gently. <i>So don't do it again, okay?</i></p>
<p>The baby Draik nodded but it seemed like he wasn't really paying attention. Fiorina turned to Ethel. <i>How did you know he would come out?</i></p>
<p><i>Well, children love sweets,</i> Ethel explained, watching Teo devour the pie. <i>I thought this would lure him out. On the Yooyuball field, you would lure your opponent with the yooyu and trap them. This is the same thing, but except with a pie.</i></p>
<p>The front door opened and footsteps alerted the players of someone approaching. Wizard stuck his head in the kitchen, his eyes focusing on Ethel, Yoris and then Teo. He looked at Fiorina and Ilsa. <i>I'm back. What exactly happened here?</i></p>
<p>Fiorina let out a nervous laugh. <i>It's a bit of a long story…</i></p>

<h1>No Frowning Allowed!</h1>
<a href="/~Quinsai"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zIV6E.png" border="0" style="float: left; padding: 5px;"></a><p>He saw it coming. His feet slowly dragged across the classroom from his desk in the back corner of the room until he came face-to-face with his teacher, Mrs. Teev. She was a Green Lenny with thick-rimmed glasses and was usually smiling. Not today, though. Something on her face told him he was about to receive a scolding.</p>
<p><i>Could you explain to me what your book report was about, Felix?</i> she asked in a high-pitched voice. She only did that when she was fed-up with a student. <i>You were so quiet and monotone; I couldn't understand a single word.</i></p>
<p>Felix shrugged. <i>I did a report on-</i></p>
<p><i>What was that?</i> Mrs. Teev leaned closer toward him, making him step back. <i>Speak up, young man, I can't hear you.</i></p>
<p>He tried again. <i>I read a book called-</i></p>
<p>She cut him off. <i>Mister, I can't hear you and I'm fairly sure the rest of the class didn't hear you. Since you're such a good student, I'll let you redo the presentation tomorrow. Please try to speak up when you do, Felix.</i></p>
<p>The bell rang afterward, signaling the end of the school day. Students flanked him from both sides as he made his way back to his desk to grab his notebooks and papers before stuffing them in his backpack. Without looking at his teacher, he walked out of the classroom.</p>
<p>Felix couldn't help himself- he never really liked smiling and he was always so quiet. No prompt or tease could ever make him talk aloud because he ignored them and it made him one of the quietest students in his class.</p>
<p><i>Hey, Felix! Wait for me!</i> a friendly voice stopped him front crossing the street. He looked over his shoulder and watched Arthur run toward him. He was a bubbly Starry Moehog and was friends with practically everyone. He enjoyed bothering Felix for some reason though. <i>Let's walk home together!</i></p>
<p>Not even Felix could ignore him- probably because they lived next door to each other. The white Kougra waited for his classmate to reach his side before walking off. Both were silent for a moment and then Arthur started to talk.</p>
<p><i>Did you enjoy the book you did for the book report? I sure did! It was the best book ever!</i> Arthur looked at Felix with a toothy smile. <i>What book did you do? I couldn't hear you from where I was sitting.</i></p>
<p><i>I did a report on <b>Kougra Tales</b>,</i> Felix answered in his quiet voice.</p>
<p><i>That sounds cool! What's it about? I couldn't hear you during your report. I bet it was really good, right?</i> Arthur nudged him.</p>
<p>Felix took a step away from his classmate and resumed walking. <i>Yeah…Mrs. Teev is making me do it again. She couldn't hear anything.</i></p>
<p><i>Aw, don't worry about it!</i> Arthur sounded super cheery for reasons Felix would never know. <i>You just gotta smile more- speak up a bit! If you smile, you'll sound way more alive. It works all the time.</i></p>
<p>His classmate shrugged. <i>I don't know…I don't smile that much.</i></p>
<p>Arthur stopped him in the middle of the sidewalk and turned to face him. <i>Come on, show me a smile! You smile all the time, don't you? Whenever you laugh, make a joke or when you're having a good time! Turn that frown upside-down!</i></p>
<p>His enthusiasm wasn't affecting Felix, unfortunately. He gave Arthur a tiny smile, which still looked like a frown. Arthur used his paws to push the ends of Felix's mouth up until he was smiling. <i>Yeah, that's it! Keep that smile on!</i></p>
<p>The moment Arthur's paws retreated, Felix's forced smile turned back into a frown. He shook his head. <i>Like I said, I don't smile a lot.</i></p>
<p><i>What about a joke, then? Those always work for me!</i> Arthur started rambling off as many jokes as he could remember but none of them made Felix smile. <i>Why do you keep on frowning? Do you want me to paint you Grey?</i></p>
<p><i>I don't know.</i> Felix wasn't too sure of why he never smiled either. <i>I don't have a lot of reason to smile, actually. It hurts after a while.</i></p>
<p>Arthur started to walk again. <i>Maybe, but if you do it often, then you'll be able to smile way more! Come on, Felix! Show me some teeth! You brush them for a reason, right? Show them off!</i></p>
<p>Felix half-heartedly gave him a toothy grin, instantly feeling embarrassed when Arthur laughed. <i>What's so funny?</i></p>
<p><i>Your smile!</i> Arthur kept on laughing. <i>It's so…so…</i> he imitated it, showing off his buck teeth. <i>It's so funny!</i></p>
<p>Even Felix had to allow a small smile at his classmate. <i>You're right.</i></p>
<p><i>Hey! A smile!</i> Arthur cheered. <i>Finally! That's still a pretty small smile so let's keep working on it.</i></p>
<p>The rest of the walk home allowed Arthur to make Felix laugh in his attempt to bring out another honest smile. When they reached Felix's neohome, he finally succeeded and saw a real smile on Felix's face.</p>
<p><i>There we go!</i> Arthur grinned. <i>Yeah! We did it! I can hear you much better now too. See? When you smile, all of Neopia looks brighter, right? Right?</i></p>
<p>Felix nodded. <i>Right. Thanks, Arthur. I'll try to smile more often now.</i></p>
<p><i>That's better! See you tomorrow, Felix!</i> Arthur waved good-bye to his classmate and then walked down the street to the neohome next door. He was looking forward to the book report tomorrow.</p>

<p><i>Alright class, settle down!</i> Mrs. Teev motioned the students back into their desks once the bell rang. School had officially begun and she was ready to start the day with a certain book report. <i>We have one presentation to go through today. Felix?</i></p>
<p>Felix stood up from his seat with his book in his paw. He looked over at Arthur two seats in front of him and he turned around and gave him a thumbs-up and a grin. Felix nodded and smiled before moving to the front of the class. After Mrs. Teev sat down at her desk, he began to speak in a clear voice.</p>
<p><i>My book report is about <b>Kougra Tales</b>…</i></p>

<h1>Chopsticks</h1>
<a href="/~Atsukami"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/y0Vv3er.png" border="0" style="float: left; padding: 5px;"></a><p>Despite living his entire life in Shenkuu, Skyler still had no idea how to use chopsticks properly. He much preferred the fork and spoon and his father never bothered to teaching him. <i>So long you don't use your paws to eat, you're fine</i>, his father always said. However, every year, during the Month of Giving feast, his grandmother always scolded him for never using his chopsticks properly. Skyler always promised her he'd learn how to use them but he had yet to fulfill that promise for almost ten years.</p>
<p>A cool breeze swept through the town of Shenkuu as pets bundled in warm jackets hurried down the streets, their destination being their neohomes. Many were headed toward Skyler's neohome as it was his family's turn to host the Month of Giving feast. His relatives greeted the latecomers at the door, taking their jackets and gesturing them to sit down. Skyler and his cousins chased each other around the living room, a form of entertainment before dinner was served. His grandparents sat in front of the fire to warm their old bones, occasionally looking over their shoulders as a form of supervision.</p>
<p>Skyler stopped chasing his younger cousin to look out the window, despite it being covered with frost. A thick layer of snow covered almost everything in his view and he looked forward to playing in it the next day. The door to the kitchen opened behind him, making him turn and watch his father hurry into the dining room, leaving a delicious aroma in his wake. Skyler's mouth watered at the thought of food, but he dreaded the moment when his grandmother spotted him using his chopsticks wrong again. He was more than ready to make up an excuse to leave the table before his grandmother saw.</p>
<p><i>Dinner is ready!</i> his mother announced. All of his relatives leaped to their paws and scrambled into the dining room, scanning the long table for their seat. Skyler found his spot at the end of the table and sat on it, seeing multiple dishes of dumplings, rice, noodles and vegetables, neatly positioned in odd shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>Before anyone could start eating, Skyler's grandmother raised her paw for silence. She was an Elderly Aisha but was still strong enough to climb trees. She surveyed everyone before speaking. <i>I would like to thank you all for coming. We are very fortunate to have family feasts, unlike some families in Neopia. Enough talk- let's start eating!</i></p>
<p>Everyone cheered and then grabbed their share of food expertly using their chopsticks. Skyler patiently waited for his mother to give him his share and then ate as slowly as he could, wondering if slow precision would fool his grandmother. By the time his cousins were asking for seconds, he was still on his first.</p>
<p>As the feast continued, Skyler could feel someone staring at him. He slowly looked up, seeing his grandmother watching him behind her glasses. He felt his cheeks burn with embarrassment, but out of respect for his elders, he put his bowl down and returned her stare. <i>Yes, Grandmother?</i></p>
<p><i>Oh, Skyler, have you finally mastered how to use chopsticks? Chopsticks are very important to our town, you know,</i> she said.</p>
<p>He reluctantly shook his head. <i>No, Grandmother, I have not. I like using my fork and spoon more.</i></p>
<p>She shook her head in dismay. <i>You'll have to learn sooner or later, young man. Not only are chopsticks easy to use and are better at picking up food, they are very important.</i></p>
<p><i>How so, Grandmother?</i></p>
<p><i>Well, instead of just telling you, I'll tell everyone.</i> She raised her paw again. The table quickly silenced after a few seconds. <i>I thought I should entertain you with a quick story. Why do we use chopsticks? They're difficult to master, yes, and the entire concept of it is strange. Why don't we use the fork and spoon? Let me tell you why.</i></p>
<p><i>For thousands of years, Shenkuu was hidden behind mist and fog. The rest of Neopia didn't know about our ancestors until a few years ago. Completely isolated from the world, our ancestors created their own traditions and ways of eating. This includes the creation of chopsticks. The people of Shenkuu still use them not only because it's tradition and they're much better than forks and spoons but to respect our ancestors and thank them for the traditions they forged. Does that make sense to everyone?</i></p>
<p>His relatives nodded while Skyler's cousins yawned and then resumed eating. Skyler, though, was in complete awe from the story. He never thought about chopsticks that way before.</p>
<p>His grandmother winked at him. <i>Does that explain everything, Skyler?</i></p>
<p><i>Yes…I wish I knew how to use them,</i> he replied wistfully.</p>
<p>She laughed. <i>Well, I can show you.</i></p>
<p>After the feast, Skyler and his grandmother stayed at the table to teach him how to master chopsticks. After a few minutes, he was able to pick up a dumpling and more, making his grandmother beam proudly. When his aunt announced it was time to open presents, he hurried out to the tree, his grandmother watching him with a smile.</p>
<p>He patiently waited for his present with the rest of his cousins and received about a dozen packages. One small one caught his attention and he opened it first, seeing it was from his grandmother. He carefully peeled off the wrapping paper, his eyes widening at the present: a pair of chopsticks. He turned to her, seeing her nod and smile. He waved the chopsticks back at her, as if to say <i>I'll honor my ancestors and you forever.</i></p>

<h1>The Mural of Friendship</h1>
<a href="/~Atsukami"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BLN9Zw2.png" border="0" style="float: left; padding: 5px;"></a><p>I had a best friend named Danni. I don't mean to brag, but we were excellent artists, especially when we were able to work together. Danni would sketch the picture and I would color it in. Our teacher Mr. Fenton would give him a higher mark than me because sketching took longer than coloring but Danni argued that coloring took just as long. So we ended up getting the same mark, which was perfect for us.</p>
<p>Some of our artwork was put on display in the Neopian Art Gallery. A few pets even knew the pair of "Danni and Arnie", the student artists. However, a few years later, Danni moved and the pair was no more. But before he did, we started on a major project. We didn't give it a name, but I called it the Mural of Friendship.</p>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HesIdM6.png" width="500" border="0"></center>
<p>On our way to Danni's house from school, I stopped him before we could cross the street to his neohome. <i>Hey, Danni, I have something to show you.</i></p>
<p><i>What is it?</i> Danni followed me further down the street.</p>
<p><i>I saw something I thought we could use,</i> I explained. I stopped and gestured with my tail at the blank white wall in front of me. <i>This blank wall...maybe we can use it for something.</i></p>
<p>Danni frowned. <i>Arnie, that's called graffiti. Don't we need permission from the mayor or something?</i></p>
<p><i>My mom knows the pet who painted this wall white,</i> I told him. <i>She said she wanted something colorful for her building so she painted this white and asked my mom if we could paint something here.</i></p>
<p>My best friend examined the wall carefully. He brushed his paws over its smooth surface and nodded slowly as he made his way down. <i>Hm...this is a really smooth wall. What did she want on it?</i></p>
<p><i>She didn't specify, but so long it's colorful, I think she'll be okay with it.</i> I rummaged through my art satchel and took out a marker and tossed it to Danni. <i>Why don't you draw something? I can paint it later.</i></p>
<p>Danni caught the marker and uncapped it. He tapped his chin while staring at the wall before leaping into action. His grip around the marker was firm as he swiftly yet carefully drew something with long strokes. That was his style- he was fast and precise and he always drew with long strokes instead of short ones. Before I knew it, he had drawn a rough sketch of a Techo. <i>Look familiar?</i> he commented with a grin.</p>
<p>I chuckled. <i>Well, you can't draw me without drawing yourself!</i></p>
<p>He laughed before turning back to the wall. He drew an Eyrie flying above the Techo. <i>There. Happy?</i></p>
<p><i>Yes, quite happy.</i> I smiled. <i>I'll come back after dinner to paint it, okay?</i></p>
<p>Danni handed the marker back to me. <i>How about we both draw and color the mural together? It's too much work for one pet to draw or color the entire mural.</i></p>
<p>I raised my eyebrows. <i>This is going to be a mural now?</i></p>
<p><i>Sure, why not?</i> Danni smiled. <i>Consider this an art project...except we're working together this time and not splitting the work. I can show you how to draw and you can show me how to paint. How does that sound?</i></p>
<p>I nodded. <i>Sounds like fun. Let's start tonight after dinner.</i></p>
<p><i>Right. Bring your paint and I'll bring my pens. This is going to be a long but fun night.</i></p>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HesIdM6.png" width="500" border="0"></center>
<p>That night, we worked on the mural as promised. We drew the neighborhood of Roo Island and the neohomes on our street. Pets that exercised in the evening would stop briefly to watch us create drawings to life when it was time to paint them. The funny thing was we never painted ourselves in. I never asked Danni about it though because he moved to Mystery Island before I had the chance.</p>
<p><i>What about the mural?</i> I asked when he told me.</p>
<p>Danni curled his tail. <i>Well...how about this: we can work on it once a month together? I'll make time to fly here myself.</i></p>
<p><i>I don't want to bother you, though,</i> I pointed out.
</p>
<p><i>You won't. I promised to show you how to draw- and you're getting pretty good at it- and to finish the mural with you. There's no way I'm breaking it.</i></p>
<p>I nodded slowly. <i>I guess I can't argue. We'll stay best friends, right?</i></p>
<p>Danni grinned. <i>Forever.</i></p>
<p>I watched him and his family move the day after we promised each other about working on the mural. He kept his promise well- he chose a day when I had nothing to do and we would work on it all day before he flew back to Mystery Island. That continued for a year until one day I received a letter.</p>
<p>The letter was a simple apology note. Danni had a very important surfing competition and couldn't come that day. I sent him a reply saying I would work on the mural myself and I did. I tried to stay positive but then I received another letter afterward, saying he couldn't come again because of school. I sent him another reply and then the month after that, when it was his time to come, he didn't send me anything.</p>
<p>I was expecting that, actually. Distant friendships never last long, but I still treated my friendship with Danni as everlasting. When he didn't send me anything else on the fourth month, I decided to walk out to the mural to see how it looked.</p>
<p>It was colorful and bursting of memories. The background was the sun setting with different shapes of our neighbors' neohomes carefully drawn and painted. There were also a few pets walking happily down the sidewalk eating ice-cream or bouncing on their tails. In the center of it all was an unpainted Techo and an unpainted Eyrie flying above it.</p>
<p>Looking at the mural almost brought me to tears. I took a deep breath and took out a marker. The corner of the mural was simply a bush so I bent down to write a message.</p>
<p><b>This mural was painted as a symbol of Arnie and Danni's everlasting friendship. It won't be completed now because Danni is too busy to come and Arnie can't finish it alone. All he asks is for Danni to read this message one day and if he agrees with their friendship being everlasting, please color in the Techo and Eyrie.</b></p>
<p>I stood up and walked away without another look.</p>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HesIdM6.png" width="500" border="0"></center>
<p>The next time I went back to the mural was five years later. I stayed on Roo Island but I was in and out during that time frame because of my job as an art teacher at Neopian Central. I wasn't expecting much from the mural to be honest, so my mind was completely blown when I saw the Techo colored in red and the Eyrie colored in yellow.</p>
<p>I ran my paw over them to see if the paint was still fresh. Sadly, it wasn't. I frowned and thought it could've been the work of another pet, but when my eyes focused on the corner of the mural, I noticed writing. I thought it was just my own message but when I looked at it closely, I realized it wasn't. It was Danni.</p>
<p><b>Arnie, this is Danni. I'm really sorry about breaking our promise like that. I suddenly got really busy and made drawing the last thing on my mind. When I finally had time, I couldn't draw a single thing. I gave up drawing in the end and became a teacher instead. But when I looked back at all the awards I won for my drawing, I realized what I was missing out. So I came back and saw your message. I really am sorry for breaking our promise and so, I colored in the Techo and Eyrie. When I have time, I will send you a neomail but until then, never give up your dream, Arnie. You taught me how to paint but it looks like I never taught you how to draw. I hope you can forgive me.</b></p>

<h1>Practice Makes Perfect</h1>
<a href="/~yireku"><img src="http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/4940/birdhouses.png" border="0" style="float: left; padding: 5px;"></a><p>Landon skidded against the stony ground again, a rubber yooyu bouncing and landing in front of him. He glared at it in frustration before slinging it away. He brushed gravel out of his tangled fur and sat down with a sigh. The sun was close to setting- he should head home.</p>
<p>The yooyu rolled harmlessly in front of someone else. Landon looked up in time to see his friend, Dexter, a talkative Starry Ruki. He picked up the yooyu and tossed it in the air. <i>You're looking grey. Do you want me to fetch my Paint Brush?</i></p>
<p>Landon scowled and jumped to his feet. <i>No, thanks. Can I have that back now?</i></p>
<p><i>Suit yourself.</i> Dexter tossed the yooyu high in the air. Landon carefully judged the angle of the yooyu and it landed in his sling before bouncing back out. <i>Grey Kyrii don't look too bad.</i></p>
<p><i>You're not funny.</i> Landon removed his sling and grabbed the yooyu before turning around.</p>
<p>Dexter raised his eyebrows. <i>I just wanted to help you, but if you don't want it, then I'll just be going.</i></p>
<p>Landon looked over his shoulder. <i>What do you know about Yooyuball?</i></p>
<p><i>My brother is Gordo Gunnels of Team Brightvale. I'm pretty certain I know what I'm talking about.</i> Dexter inspected Landon's sling. <i>Your sling isn't buckled on properly and it's for left-handed players, not right-handed ones. If you fix that first, then I'll show you some pointers.</i></p>
<p>Landon shook his head. <i>Thanks, but no thanks. I can do this on my own.</i></p>
<p>He walked toward his neohome again and Dexter followed. <i>Why not? No one can be good without help from others.</i> he said. <i>It took my brother years of practice before he could be on Roo Island's team. Then he transferred but we stayed here because Brightvale just wasn't for us.</i></p>
<p>His friend didn't answer. Dexter continued on. <i>Don't you know you have to practice before you can be good at something? Yooyuball's the same- sure, some pets have natural talent for it, but most folks would have to practice, like my brother. Like you. Experts aren't always born- experts become experts after they practice and improve.</i></p>
<p><i>I know that,</i> Landon said. <i>It's just...sometimes I wish I can be good right now. Does that make sense? Yooyuball tryouts are next week and Coach Bales told me I wouldn't have any chance of getting on the team.</i></p>
<p>Dexter chuckled. <i>That's just how Coach is. Unless you really, really, want to improve, then he'll let you join the team. I guess that means you're mediocre. Mediocre players would never get on the team.</i></p>
<p><i>Then what am I supposed to do?</i> Landon asked, exasperated. The conversation was going in circles.</p>
<p><i>Let me help you, maybe? The key to improving is by letting others help you and knowing yourself what you need to improve.</i></p>
<p>Landon was reluctant to accept his help, but he really wanted to be good at Yooyuball. <i>Fine.</i></p>
<p><i>Great!</i> Dexter grinned. <i>Oh, can I ask you something else? Why do you want to be on the team so badly?</i></p>
<p>His friend glanced at his yooyu sling. <i>Uh...well, I just want to be good at something and be known for it. I'm okay in every other sport, but if I could be good at one sport, then I can be really good at it. Does that make sense?</i></p>
<p><i>Sure it does.</i> Dexter nodded in agreement. <i>I mean, I've felt the same way. But now I'm just good at being a good friend, and I think that's good enough for me.</i></p>
<p><i>Being a good friend, huh?</i> Landon tossed the yooyu in the air for Dexter to catch. <i>Makes sense. We can't always be good at something, right?</i></p>
<p>Dexter caught it easily with his paw. <i>Right. Practice makes perfect, after all.</i></p>

<h1>My Hero</h1>
<a href="/~natalveesa"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kU1q4SN.png" border="0" style="float: left; padding: 5px;"></a><p>I never knew who my hero was until the day Miss Canny gave us that assignment in school. Every student was buzzing with excitement about who to write about, but I simply sat there, staring at my piece of paper. My mind was completely blank. Who was my hero? I didn't even know.</p>
<p>My friend, Gloria knew exactly who to write about. <i>There's only one pet in Neopia that I can write about,</i> she announced somewhat loudly. <i>That'd be Mr. Colchester! You know everything about him, right? Can you just tell me about him? It would be faster than reading through the Neopedia.</i></p>
<p>I shook my head. <i>I actually don't know anything about him. We hardly talk. We meet maybe once or twice a month, if I'm lucky.</i></p>
<p><i>That's disappointing.</i> Gloria frowned. <i>Then who are you going to write about?</i></p>
<p><i>Not about Father, that's for sure.</i> I tapped my chin. <i>Maybe...Leera Heggle from Lost Desert's Yooyuball team? I think he's a really good goalkeeper.</i></p>
<p>Before she could reply, the bell rang, signalling the end of the school day. I gathered my books and fled the classroom as fast as I could so Gloria wouldn't be able to give me her daily lecture about how Team Mystery Island was better.</p>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HesIdM6.png" width="500" border="0"></center>
<p>I kicked my feet through the grains of sand sitting on the beach on my way home to the Colchester household, located on a private beach. I reached the stairs leading to the kitchen and climbed up them, opening the door with my paw and entering it.</p>
<p>The kitchen was spacious with professional cooking equipment lined up against the wall. A closed door led to the other parts of the house that were usually covered in dust from disuse. A Red Zafara wearing an apron stood in front of the oven and looked up when I closed the door. <i>Welcome back, Camille. How was school?</i></p>
<p><i>Miss Canny said we have to write about our hero, but I don't have one,</i> I explained, putting my backpack on the table and sitting down in one of the chairs. <i>I might write about Leera Heggle. He's an amazing goalkeeper. What do you think, Loretta?</i></p>
<p>She took out a tray of cookies and placed them on the table before sitting down beside me. <i>You do know that there is one person who is closer than you think that you can write about, right?</i></p>
<p>I frowned. <i>Do you mean Father? He's not my hero. I hardly speak to him. Jordie sees him more than I do!</i></p>
<p><i>Jordie is Mr. Colchester's assistant,</i> Loretta explained patiently. <i>Besides, he has done more than Captain Heggle has.</i></p>
<p><i>Did Father win the Altador Cup?</i> I asked.</p>
<p><i>Well, no, but...</i> Loretta paused for a moment. <i>Alright, let me ask you this: what is a hero in your eyes?</i></p>
<p>I reached for a cookie but burnt my paw in the process. I pulled it back with a wince. <i>Well...they have to be older than me...and they have to have done something amazing. They also have to be big, strong and really confident about what they do, and I guess they should've saved someone's life.</i></p>
<p>Loretta took her apron off. <i>Mr. Colchester fits your description perfectly, dear. He discovered many things and is an inspiration for explorers everywhere. He also saved many people, including Neopia.</i></p>
<p>I shook my head. <i>Captain Heggle is amazing too and he saved a lot of younger pets. It was in the Neopian Times!</i></p>
<p><i>Yes, I know, I read that article with you. It is true that Captain Heggle matches your description too, but your father has done more than that.</i></p>
<p>I picked up another cookie and bit into it. <i>Like what?</i></p>
<p><i>He saved your life,</i> Loretta said simply. <i>You were abandoned and Mr. Colchester took you in as your own. If it weren't for him, no one knows where you could've ended up.</i></p>
<p>I listened in silence. I knew very well that I was adopted since I was a Cybunny and he was a Lutari, but that wasn't the point.</p>
<p><i>He can't stop from being an explorer- it's what he has been doing all his life. He could take you along with him, but he doesn't want you to get hurt. You may not know it, but he does love you as if you were his real daughter. He would give up exploring to spend more time with you, but since everything nowadays require Neopoints, there is no way he can support you without it.</i> Loretta stood up. <i>That's all I wanted to say. You can write about Captain Heggle if you want. I can't force you not to.</i></p>
<p>I watched her exit the kitchen. I stared at the plate of cookies while hearing Loretta's voice go through my mind again. It was true that my father had accomplished a lot in his short lifetime and I was proud of that- but was it real? I couldn't tell. What I did know was that I never thanked him for saving me that day. He fulfilled every wish I had and I repaid him with words he would never hear again. I opened my backpack and took out the empty piece of paper and a pencil. I knew exactly what to write about.</p>

<textarea id="story">
September had rolled around again and now is the time to go back to school! You scurry through the marketplace in search of school supplies but none of the shops have anything you are looking for. Before you could go home, a flyer taped to the wall catches your attention. You glance at it.
<i>It's back to school! Do you need *insert site service* to *insert improvement here (for example, reviews to polish up homework, buttons to look cool, etc.)* Come down to *insert site name* for the best *insert site service* around!</i>
The flyer had caught your attention. You run off in a hurry to see what they had in store.
</textarea><br><br><h2>Backstage</h2>
<textarea id="story">
You aren't sure how you arrived backstage but you did. Pets in various shapes and sizes dressed in colorful outfits pass by you but you take no attention. You look up to see a *insert rough description of you* smiling at you. You ask *insert gender* where the exit is. *insert gender* replies by saying the show is about to begin and before you know it, the curtains are raised and the spotlight is on you.
</textarea><br><br><h3>Barnyard</h3>
<textarea id="story">
A chorus of various noises arouses you from your sleep. You look out the window, seeing nothing but vast hills of green, the sun shining brightly on the rows of crops that have yet to be watered. You let out a yawn but it is a short one as you smile to yourself. It is another day on the fields, another day to work and another day to fulfil smiles of Neopians everywhere.
</textarea><br><br><h2>Bookstore</h2>
<textarea id="story">
A calm silence falls over the bookstore as you wander up and down the aisles in search for books. You run your hands over the spines while scanning their titles but nothing seems to interest you. You reach the end of the aisle and prepare to run around to look on the other side but someone catches your eye. A *insert rough description of you* looks at you and winks before walking away with a book in *his/her* hand. You can't help but feel as if *he/she* will lead you to a good book so you follow *him/her* further into the bookstore.
</textarea><br><br><h3>Bright Lights</h3>
<textarea id="story">
The sun had set and the night is beginning to appear. Lights from neohomes, shops and street lights turn on, lighting the dim world in front of you. Various pets walk up and down the sidewalks, grateful for the light and you can't help but look around with wonder, as blinking lights show off their shop's marvelous display. One shop catches your eye and you can't help but enter, seeing the sign reading *insert site name* in bright lights. Curious, you open the door and enter.
</textarea><br><br><h3>Bubbles</h3>
<textarea id="story">
Floating through a clear blue sky are bubbles of various sizes. You watch them drift through the air carefree, reflecting images as they spiral higher toward the sun. You stick your hand out and allow one bubble land on it, feeling soft and gentle in your hand. You stare at it for a few seconds and then let it free, watching it join the rest of the bubbles into the sky, their destination unknown.
</textarea><br><br><h2>Campfire</h2>
<textarea id="story">
A fire cackled in its pit in the ground, allowing its embers to dance into the night sky. You feel shivers running up and down your arms but all you can do is wait for the fire to extinguish itself. Before you could drift off to sleep, *insert your gender* taps you on the shoulder and begins to tell you a story…
</textarea><br><br><h3>Chorus of Carols</h3>
<textarea id="story">
The sky begins to darken but lights still light up the streets and shops. With your hands in your pockets, you approach the stage of the festival, seeing a dozen or less pets bundled in warm coats, singing, their voices entwining to create a beautiful piece of art. You can't help but stop and stare at them in awe, their voices echoing in your mind as you become enamored by their music.
</textarea><br><br><h3>City Stalls</h3>
<textarea id="story">
Pets of all shapes and sizes jostled you from both sides. You try to push your way through to safety but end up being shouldered into a quiet store. The atmosphere is quiet and only a *insert rough description of you* stood behind the counter. *insert gender* looked up with a smile. <i>Welcome to *insert site name*. How can I help you?</i>
</textarea><br><br><h2>Cliffhanger</h2>
<textarea id="story">
There is no escape. The ground beneath you is the only way you can flee. All you have to do is jump over the edge of land safely...right? Taking a breath, you close your eyes, steel your nerves, take one step over the edge and fall. The breeze makes you feel like you're soaring and maybe you are. Or maybe you're not...
</textarea><br><br><h3>Clouds</h3>
<textarea id="story">
All you could see was clouds, clouds and more clouds. Confusion claims you but before you could question the empty space in front of you about your location, dozens of creatures begin to spread their wings and fly aimlessly through the sky, completely carefree. A voice in your mind urges you to do the same and so you open your arms, close your eyes and take off into the sea of clouds.
</textarea><br><br><h2>Dreary Curtain</h2>
<textarea id="story">
A curtain of gray, dreary rain falls descends on you, bringing a light mist to the forest. You look up, noticing a *insert short description of you* staring back at you. You blink and they disappear from your sight. Determined to get out of the rain, you walk toward *him/her* in hopes of finding shelter.
</textarea><br><br><h3>Falling Stars</h3>
<textarea id="story">
The night sky is littered with stars. You point with your eyes and fingers at the numerous falling stars, making as many wishes as you can. One star seems to be approaching you faster and faster each time until it collides with the ground in front of you. The blow sends you backwards and smoke and dust obscures your view. When the air becomes clear, a *insert rough description of you* stands with a confused smile but *insert gender* makes in hesitation to introduce themselves to you.
</textarea><br><br><h2>Faerie Dust</h2>
<textarea id="story">
Despite the dark sky washing over the skies above your head, you can't help but wonder exactly what kind of shower is sparkling down onto the ground. It sparkles in front of you, bringing light and magic to your surroundings, vanishing once it hits the ground. You reach out with a hand and allow one speck to fall onto your palm. You watch it sparkle and glow, as if lighting your way home. Feeling comforted by its light, you begin to walk through the darkness,
</textarea><br><br><h3>Foggy Forest</h3>
<textarea id="story">
A thick blanket of fog envelopes you as you continue your trek through the forest. It obscures your view and you begin to wonder whether or not if you are still on the right path. Forcing yourself to remain calm and continue walking, you trek down the path, allowing the fog to hug you as you delve deeper into the unknown.
</textarea><br><br><h2>Forest Path</h2>
<textarea id="story">
Lush green trees tower over you while you walk down the path. Small creatures watched you from the shadows but vanished when you looked at them. You pause, seeing a fork in the path. Your instinct tells you right, but before you could move, a piece of paper flies into your face! You tear it off and look at it, your curiosity snatched within seconds.
<i>Are you looking for *insert site service*? The letters stared back at you. Then why don't you come to *insert site name* for the best *insert site service* around? My name is *insert your name*, here at your service!</i> The last few words echoed back to you and you whirl around, seeing a *insert rough description of you*.
</textarea><br><br><h3>Home Sweet Bakery</h3>
<textarea id="story">
Bells jingled when you opened the door. A sweet smell of pastry and bread drifted in the air and to your nose, making you drool a bit. There were small round tables in front of you and you seat yourself. Within an instant, a *insert rough description of you* comes to your side, showing you their menu. <i>We serve only the best *insert site service* around, so please enjoy looking around!</i> *insert gender* tells you. It looks promising indeed, you think to yourself as you begin reading.
</textarea><br><br><h2>Icy Cavern</h2>
<textarea id="story">
A chilly breeze swept through the icy cavern as you continue walking through it. Ice crystals glisten under the light as if they are greeting you and you can't help but notice how clear they are. They face and point in the direction you are headed, as if urging you to continue and you do, admiring your reflection along the way.
</textarea><br><br><h3>Jazz Café</h3>
<textarea id="story">
You push open a door, hearing a set of bells ring as you enter the café. A stage sits in the center and a Kyrii was playing his saxophone with closed eyes. Pets were gathered around him, listening to his music and you can't help but join them. The entire café's atmosphere is calm and quiet as the central focus is the Kyrii and his saxophone. You settle down comfortably in an armchair, your eyes not once leaving the Kyrii.
</textarea><br><br><h2>Lazy Morning</h2>
<textarea id="story">
You blink open your eyes, seeing sunlight streaming into your room through the curtains. You roll over to check the time, realizing you had slept it. It didn't matter though. The start of the day is about to begin.
</textarea><br><br><h3>Mysterious Lodge</h3>
<textarea id="story">
Torrential rain falls down onto your head. You run through the slippery and muddy ground, hoping you won't fall in your mad dash for cover. You spot a lodge up ahead while blinking away raindrops and you quickly make your way toward it, seeing the name *insert site name* printed at the top of the door. You yank it open and slam it behind you before surveying the lodge.
It was a single room with a table and candle sitting on top of it. A small notebook was beside it and the window was frosted over. A *insert rough description of you* approaches you and gives you a nod before saying <i>welcome to *insert site name*. My name is *insert your name*, and I'm here to help you.</i>
</textarea><br><br><h2>Spooky Castle</h2>
<textarea id="story">
Decaying trees greets you as you continue down the suspicious non-existent path. The air is dark and faint noises catch your attention but you aren't sure as to where it might be from. You look ahead, your eyes widening at the strange stone-walled castle looming before you. Moss covers the outside walls and you push open a rusting iron gate. A single wooden door stands in your way and you open it, encountering a magnificent sight.
