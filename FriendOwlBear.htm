Thank you for visiting this pet page!  <p>I am very excited to share my idea for a couple of Vandagyres.  I love the look of this raptor/owl based pet, and I wanted to make designs for currently unavailable colors that could potentially boost this pet's popularity.  So, let's begin with--

</p><h2>The Valentines Vandagyre</h2>
<p><img src="http://preview.redd.it/9z2kcgbngnia1.png?width=470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c154a236f82b03711fb058e868a55ab874d3ec73"></p><p>By creating as many heart shapes within the body that I could while adhering to the color's design standard, this Vandagyre has appeal similar to a Care Bear Cousin without the copyright infringement XD.  Snuggable, huggable, and all around lovable, it's a perfect sweetheart for anyone that loves teddy bears and pink.

</p><h2>The Maraquan Vandagyre</h2>
<p><img src="http://preview.redd.it/o5ptekbngnia1.png?width=470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4316890a164c67a94bf04aa21b119b14a073049c"></p><p>The animal I had in mind when making this idea was the <b><a href="/">Sea Angel</a></b>, a deep-sea slug with a semi-transparent body.  The shape of the sea angel is incoporated quite easily into the basic Vandagyre design, and I would absolutely love to see schools of these buddies swimming on the ocean floor.

</p><p>I sincerely hope these suggestions are taken into consideration by TNT.  Thank you for your time!</p></center><BR><BR><BR>
