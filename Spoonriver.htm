<p>This is a two-step startup guide for that oh-so-reluctant Kadoatie feeder – the avatar collector who has finally run out of other ones that look easier to get, and is forced to brave the dreaded Kadoatery.
</p>

<p><span class="bold">This guide will teach you one effective way to Kad.</span> You will probably not be instantly really good at it, but you <i>will</i> be able to get your avatar with persistence. *Disclaimer: This is a strategy guide, not a magic incantation! I can tell you things that I think will help you, but I cannot guarantee success.*
</p>

<p>This guide starts from the assumption that you have a brain, but you know pretty much nothing about Kadding. If a section is explaining something that you already know, feel free to skip right over it. If a section seems to be missing some details, see if your own knowledge of this site can fill them in.

</h2></div>
<p>Yes, I know a glossary is supposed to go at the end, but these are things you may need to know before reading the rest of the guide.
</p>

<h5>Kad feeders use a lot of acronyms and abbreviations. Here are definitions for the common ones:
 </h5>
<p style="margin: 0px 20px 10px 30px;">
Kad - When used as a noun, this is short for Kadoatie. Used as a verb, it means to feed a Kadoatie.<br><br>
UB - Unbuyable. An item that costs over 99,999np. UB Kads are ones that are asking for unbuyable foods. UB feeders are people who feed the Kads that are asking for unbuyable foods.<br><br>
TP -  Trading Post<br><br>
(S)SW - (Super) Shop Wizard<br><br>
SDB - Safety Deposit Box<br><br>
Invent - Short for your Inventory. A Kad Invent is a set of foods you keep in your inventory while Kadding.<br><br>
RF - Refresh. The RF time is the minute that you should refresh the Kadoatery to see if any Kads get hungry.<br><br>
OFer - Overfeeder. This is used to refer to people who feed over 75 Kadoaties, because the avatar is the last possible prize you can earn for feeding Kads.<br><br>
TKer - Timekeeper. Timekeepers post current refresh times on the boards so that people who want to Kad know when the next refresh is. <br><br>
NTO - Not Taking Over. You'll find this all over the timekeeping boards, and it's irrelevant to your avatar-getting experience. TKers like to pretend they won't be Kadding for hours, and they write this after all their posts so nobody will expect them to keep posting times.<br><br>
CF - Short for Congratulations on Feeding (a Kadoatie). You may see people say this to each other on chat boards.</p>

<div class="section" id="s3">
<div class="hdiv" style="border-radius: 15px;"><h2>There Are Four Ways to Kad</h2></div>
<h5>There are four ways to feed Kads, and each comes with advantages and disadvantages.
</h5>

<p><span class="bold">Invent</span> – Keep Kad foods in your inventory, so when a Kad asks for one, you can quickly feed it without having to go find the item first.<br>
Pro: This is usually considered the fastest way to feed.<br>
Con: You can only have 50 items in your inventory, and the Kads can ask for hundreds of different foods. Your foods won't be asked for very often.
 </p>

<p><span class="bold">SDB</span> – Keep a bunch of Kad foods in your SDB, and when a Kad asks for one, you quickly search for it, get it out, and feed it to the Kad. This method is often combined with Invent feeding.<br>
Pro: Faster than SW, and you can have many more items in your SDB than your inventory.<br>
Con: Buying enough Kad foods for this to be really effective is expensive, and you won't ever use most of them just getting the avatar. This method is better for overfeeders.
 </p>

<p><span class="bold">SW</span> – When a Kad asks for a food, you copy and paste it into the Shop Wizard, search for it and buy the first one that comes up, then go back to the Kadoatery and feed the Kad. This method can be combined with Invent feeding, but you must have less than 50 items in your Invent, or you won't be able to purchase anything.<br>
Pro: This method works for every non-UB food the Kads ask for, and you don't want to feed UBs anyway.<br>
Con: This is the slowest way to feed. You have to load the most pages, and sometimes the shop you get will be full of huge blinky pictures. You also sometimes get ripped off on prices because you won't have time to shop around.
 </p>

<p><span class="bold">UB</span> – Feed one of the Kads in the top couple rows that is asking for a UB. These foods are generally available for purchase on the TP.<br>
Pro: You will have basically no competition at all. Some of those Kads go hungry for weeks.<br>
Con: Insanely expensive.
 </p>
<div class="tip" style="height: auto; width: 540px;">
<h3>Ok That's Great But All I Want Is An Avatar</h3>
In my opinion, SW feeding is the best combination of low hassle, relatively cheap, and reasonably quick. You absolutely DO NOT need to feed UB Kads in order to get the avatar. Most of the foods cost under 5k, and many of those are under 1k. You can feed all 75 of your Kads for less than the price of one UB.

</div>
<p>
This guide will only teach you to SW feed. If you're here looking for instructions for one of the other ways, you've come to the wrong place.

</p>
</div>


<div class="section" id="s4">
<div class="hdiv" style="border-radius: 15px;"><h2>Step 1 - The Setup and How to be Fast
</h2></div>
<p>First, you need to set up your screen so that you can find the Kad you want to feed as fast as possible, copy the name of the food it wants and buy it as fast as possible, then get back to the Kad again and feed it as fast as possible. 
</p>

<h5>You should play with your setup until you've got your screen arranged in the way that is easiest and quickest for you.</h5>
<p>My recommendation is to have two windows open:
 </p>
<div class="tip" style="height: auto; width: 200px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
<h3>Every Second Saved Helps</h3>I normally don't bother to wear my glasses, but I always take the time to put them on when I'm Kadding.
</div>
<p>Put the Kadoatery in one, and zoom it out until you can see the clock plus as many Kads as possible while still being able to easily read the text. If it's too small for you to see, it's not going to be fast. In the second window, open three tabs of the Shop Wizard, and set them all to "identical to my phrase" and then click in the search box for each one so you get the blinky cursor in there and it's all ready to paste a food and hit enter to search when you need it. See if you can shrink the windows enough to put them side-by-side so you can easily click back and forth between the two.
</p>
<p> There are two reasons to have three SW tabs open. One is that some of the foods you search for will turn out to be UBs  and come up with no results. You'll want to be able to just copy another food and try again with your next tab without having to reset your SW page. The other reason is that you will get beat to Kads. You'll go buy the food, go back and click on the Kad, and it will say someone else already fed it. When this happens, quickly refresh the Kadoatery to see if any are still hungry, copy/paste a new food into your next pre-prepared SW tab, and try again. After you feed a Kad, or when there are no more hungry ones left, then panic time is over and you can reset all of your SW tabs to be ready for the next RF. You can either keep the junk foods you end up buying and try to Invent feed them, or you can go the lazy route like me and just toss them in your shop to deal with later.
</p>
<div class="tip" style="height: auto; width: 540px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
<h3>You Probably Don't Have Infinite Neopoints</h3>Take a moment to think about your budget. Even if a food is buyable, it may cost more than you're willing to spend on a single Kad. It's quite possible to reach the Avatar and never feed a Kad that costs more than 1k. If you set your limit at 2k or 5k, that will give you a bit more leeway.
</div>
</div>


<div class="section" id="s5">
<div class="hdiv" style="border-radius: 15px;"><h2>Step 2 - Figuring Out the Refresh Times</h2></div>
<h5>Now you're ready to feed your first Kad, but how do you know when they're going to be hungry?
</h5>

<p>There is always a board up on the games chat that looks like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/kadoatery.gif"> Kadoatery Feeding Times &amp; Lists <img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/kadoatie.gif"> Please read first posts!</p>
<p>Sometimes all the TKers poof and there are no current times posted (always check what time the last post was to make sure it's for the current hour) but usually you'll find something that looks like this:
</p>

<p>Main and Mini #1(2) pending rf @ :12<br>
New Mini #2 rf @ :26
</p>
<div class="tip" style="height: auto; width: 540px;">
<h3>Time to Define Some More Words for You</h3>New means that a Kad was fed, and the first chance it has to get hungry again is the RF after the one listed.<br>
Pending means that a Kad didn't get hungry at its last opportunity, so it could get hungry at the listed time.<br>
The Main is the biggest group of Kads that are all on the same schedule. These are the ones that all asked for cheap foods, so they all got fed at the same time and will all be hungry again at the same time.<br>
A Mini is a single Kad or a small group of them that got fed at a different time than the rest, so they will get hungry again at a different time than the rest. The number in parentheses is the number of Kads in the Mini. If there is more than one Mini at a time, they get numbered to tell them apart.
</div>
<p>The first line means that the Main, and also the first Mini have a chance to get hungry at the next time ending in :12. For example, if it is now 4:07, then the refresh time would be 4:12. Either the Main or the Mini or both could go at that time. If they both go at the same time, then they merge, and the Kads from the Mini will become part of the Main. The second line means that there is also a second Mini waiting, but the soonest it can get hungry is the first refresh after :26.
</p>

<p>Kads usually go at 20 seconds after the minute, so in this example, if they get hungry it will happen at around 4:12:20. Kads are not always exactly on time, so keep refreshing for a few seconds in case they're just late.</p>

<p class="red">**Jan 2014: The times are currently messed up, and the Kads have been going up to a minute and a half late. Keep refreshing all the way through the minute AFTER the RF time to be sure you don't miss them**
</p>

<p>The way the times work is that Kads have a chance to get hungry every 7 minutes. If they don't, then you check again 7 minutes later. If they do, then after they're fed they cannot be hungry again for 28 minutes, and then they start the 7 minute cycle again.
</p>

<h5>So you really want to Kad, but you can't find anybody who knows the current times?
</h5>

<p>It is possible to figure them out yourself, and here are the steps:<br>
-Find the most recent time that you can, even if it's a Mini from three hours ago on the TK board. <br>
-Keep adding 7 minutes to that time until you get to a time that is in the future. This becomes your RF time. You have to be good at adding 7 for this because if you get the wrong number you are not going to be a happy camper.<br>
-Refresh at that time and see if any Kads go. If not, then add 7 again and repeat.
</p>
<div class="tip" style="height: auto; width: 125px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
<h3>How to Count</h3>The easy way to add 28 is to add a half hour, and then subtract two minutes.
</div>
<p>When you see a Kad go:<br>
-If it was a whole bunch of them, then great, you found the main! Add 28 minutes to the time you refreshed to get the New Main. (Add it to the RF time you calculated, even if the Kads went late. If they're on time for the next Main, you don't want to miss them!)<br>
-If it was 1-3 of them, it was probably a Mini. Add 28 to that RF time, and that becomes the New Mini. Also add 7 to the time you refreshed to get the next possible pend time. You still need to find the Main!
</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="s6">
<div class="hdiv" style="border-radius: 15px;"><h2>The Meepits are in the Details
</h2></div>
<p>
That's it! Those two steps are all the preparation you need to succeed at Kadding and start on your way toward earning that sickeningly adorable pink avatar. There are, however, a few more things I wanted to say to you that didn't fit in the sections above.
</p>
<p>
<span class="bold">Double-check everything before you start.</span> Nothing is more frustrating than seeing a Kad you can feed and missing it because you overlooked something obvious. Check these things:</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 20px 10px 30px;">
-Your inventory contains less than 50 items<br>
-You have enough neopoints out of the bank<br>
-You are not on a faerie quest<br>
-Your Shop Wizards are all set to "identical" rather than containing<br>
-Your Kadoatery is zoomed out but you can still see the clock and read the words<br>
-You know the current RF times.
</p>
<p>
<span class="bold">To actually feed a Kad, you need to have the right food in your inventory, and then click on the Kad.</span> If you click on it once, you'll get a cute message about how it's so happy, and thank you so much. If you double- triple- or quadruple-click on the Kad, you'll get a message saying sorry, it's already been fed by [insert username here], and it will be your username. This happens to me all the time, because I worry about accidentally missing it and click a bunch of times. It still counts as a feed, you just don't get the Yay! Happy! screen. If you feed at the exact same time as someone else, your name won't appear under the Kad you fed, but it will still count toward your total.
</p>
<p>How do you know exactly which Kads will get hungry in the next Main or Mini? When a Kad goes, the top left fed one disappears, all the other ones shuffle left one spot, and a new hungry one appears in the lower right. If a bunch go at once, they will fill up rows from the bottom of the screen, from right to left. This means that all the unfed UB Kads eventually get shuffled up to the top where you can ignore them, and just focus on the active rows at the bottom.
</p>
<div class="tip" style="height: auto; width: 540px;">
<h3>No Hogging the Kadoatery</h3>You cannot feed a Kad when your name is already listed in the Kadoatery for feeding a different one. This means that if you fed during the Main, you can't feed any Minis that go before the Main goes again and clears your name out. (Exception: Ties, because your name is not listed.) Also, it is against the rules to feed from two separate accounts during one Main or Mini.
</div>
<p>
<span class="bold"> Kadding takes actual practice.</span> You need to teach your muscles where the words to copy are going to be, and where the links to click are going to be so that you can get everything quickly on the first try. You'll probably find that when you first start you end up buying a lot of foods that you aren't able to feed in time, but the more Kads you feed, the more practice you'll have, and the quicker you'll get. By the time you're getting near the avatar, you'll likely be able to feed on your first try most of the time.
</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="s7">
<div class="hdiv" style="border-radius: 15px;"><h2>Kadding is Boring and 75 is a Big Number
</h2></div>
<p>You are not the only person who still needs the Kad avatar, and the time will go by much quicker if you have someone to chat and complain with while you Kad. Get a neofriend or two to Kad with you and you can double-check each other's math when you're figuring out RF times, as well as commiserate or congratulate each other when you fail or succeed at feeding a Kad. Prime places to locate people to chat with are your guild, the chat boards, and your neofriends list.
</p>

<p>Not a social butterfly? Non-flash games are another good way to pass the time while you're waiting for the next RF. You can play something like Pyramids, Tyranu Evavu, or Neoquest and just get in the habit of glancing at the clock every time the page reloads. When it's time to check the Kadoatery, go to that tab and do your refreshing, then come back to the game until the next RF.
</p>

</div>

<div class="section" id="s8">
<div class="hdiv" style="border-radius: 15px;"><h2>FAQ</h2></div>
<p><span class="bold">Q: How do I know what Kad to go for/avoid?</span><br>
A: To start, go for the one you can copy the quickest. If you notice that you often get beat when you go for that spot, and there is another spot that's usually still open when you refresh again, start going for the other spot on your first try. As you Kad more, you will begin to recognize the usernames of the people who are typically faster than you, and learn which spots they usually feed.
 </p>

<p><span class="bold">Q: I refreshed when only the Main was pending, and a Mini went instead! I'm sure I had the times right, so what happened?</span><br>
A: Sometimes a Mini will randomly split off of the Main when nobody expects it. The rest of the Main is still pending for the next RF. 
 </p>

<p> <span class="bold">Q: I was Kadding at night and all the Kads including the ones that were fed started crying. What happened?</span><br>
A: Kadoaties are afraid of the dark, and TNT turns off the lights from 11pm until something like 5am. Just ignore it, and be glad there's no sound effects.
</p>

<p><span class="bold">Q: What time of day is best for Kadding?</span><br>
A: The best time to Kad is when the fewest users are logged in. This is between about 10:00pm NST and 4:00am NST. But don't worry if that is not a time that you are able to Kad! It is totally possible to feed them during the rest of the day too.
 </p>

<p><span class="bold">Q: I'm too slow. Always! How am I possibly supposed to feed even one Kad?</span><br>
A: If by "always" you mean "all three times that I tried" then you need to keep trying. Getting your act together will take some practice, and sometimes you will just be unlucky and choose the wrong Kad to try to feed. On any refresh, you could get a UB, or one that somebody Invent fed and you never stood a chance. SW feeding works totally fine for the majority of people, but if you really have tried a lot of times and don't see anything you can do to improve your speed, you may want to try Invent or SDB feeding, as those methods are faster than SW feeding and could give you the edge you need.
 </p>

<p><span class="bold">Q: Why do all those overfeeders keep clogging up the Kadoatery? They're making it impossible for the people who actually need the avatar!</span><br>
A: Overfeeders only continue to Kad because they think it's fun, not because they're trying to ruin your Neo-life. Many of them know each other, and it's an activity they enjoy doing together and chatting about. Kadding is boring, difficult, and expensive, and it's not something you waste your time on unless you actually enjoy it.
