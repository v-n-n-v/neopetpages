		<h2>Faerie Quests</h2>
		<div class="main">What in the world? Here you are, minding your own business, and suddenly there's a faerie sitting on your page, demanding an item. And when you go to the Shop Wizard to look for it, she tells you that you're cheating! What to do, what to do, what a to-do!<br><br>
First thing, <b>don't panic</b>. <i>She</i> popped up on <i>your</i> screen; you're in charge now. She can tap her foot impatiently all day, but you don't have a time limit. You can take as long as you need to in order to get the item for her, even if it's the Faerie Queen herself.<br><br>
Secondly, head over to the <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Marchegai#Board">Quests Board</a>. It's there for just this very reason.  Post a topic asking for someone to use the Shop Wizard and find you a shop that has the item. Remember, everyone else <i>isn't</i> on a Faerie Quest, so they can do that; this way isn't cheating.<br><br>We'll talk about the Quest Board later, but for now, let's meet these faeries.<br><br><h3>How to Complete a Faerie Quest (the short version)</h3>
<blockquote><br>1. Post a topic on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=9">Quest Board</a> asking for a Shop Wizard lookup.<br><br>
2. Enter one of the provided usernames in the Search Neopets box.<br><br>
3. On the user's lookup, click their Shop link.<br><br>
4. Find and buy the item.<br><br>
5. Go to the <a href="//www.neopets.com/quests.phtml">Faerie Quests</a> page.<br><br>
6. Click "I have your item.<br><br></blockquote>

		<h4>The Faeries</h4>
		<div class="main">
		There are 9 different Faeries from whom you might get a Quest: Fire, Earth, Water, Air, Dark, Light, Queen, Space, and Fountain Faerie.<br><br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/newuberfirefaerie.gif" height="75" width="75" border="0"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/newuberearthfaerie.gif" height="75" width="75" border="0"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/newuberwaterfaerie.gif" height="75" width="75" border="0"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/newuberairfaerie.gif" height="75" width="75" border="0"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/newuberdarknessfaerie.gif" height="75" width="75" border="0"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/newuberlightfaerie.gif" height="75" width="75" border="0"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/newfaeriequeen.gif" height="75" width="75" border="0"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/spacefaerie.gif" height="75" width="75"><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/rainbowfountainfaerie.gif" height="75" width="75"></center><br>

If you ever forget which Faerie gave you a Quest or if you need to double-check the item she wants, either try to use the <a href="//www.neopets.com/market.phtml?type=wizard">Shop Wizard</a> and click the link she gives you or visit the <a href="//www.neopets.com/quests.phtml">Faerie Quests</a> page. She'll be right there to remind you, no worries.<br><br> Just to emphasize this point about <i>all</i> these random Faerie Quests: <em>there is no time limit</em>! You can take days or weeks to finish it if you need to. If you don't have enough NPs to get the item you need, you can go play <a href="//www.neopets.com/gameroom.phtml">Games</a> until you <i>do</i> have enough.<br><br>
Once you have the item, go back to the <a href="//www.neopets.com/quests.phtml">Faerie Quests</a> page and click the "I have the item" button. The Faerie will then bless your pet.</div>

What good are stats? Stats are useful <a href="/~Deulwyn">in the Battledome</a>*. So if you don't battle with your pets and you don't care about what their stats are, then you might not find the rewards all that useful.

Now, those last 3 Faeries I list as "usually", in terms of the worth of completing their Quests. What if the Queen or Space Faerie asks you for an unbuyable (over 100,000 NP) item but your pets are all low-level? You could train them at the training schools for much less than the Quest costs. Or if you don't have many NPs at all, and the Fountain Faerie wants an unbuyable--fabulous as her Quest is--you might be playing games for ages! You might as well cancel the Quest, have access to the Shop Wizard, and buy the paint brush yourself.<br><br>

Also, occasionally a regular faerie will ask for an item that turns out to be expensive. This is usually because the item is newly released and/or on the higher end of the faerie's rarity range, so it hasn't yet or doesn't restock quite as much and people are buying up the items and keeping the price high. If the price for a regular faerie's quest is higher than the training would cost for the same stats, you should turn down the Quest.

<h4>Item Lists</h4>
<div class="main">
The items categories that the six basic faeries ask for can be found in the previous chart. If you want to know the rarity or the actual item names these six ask for, check out <a href="/~Quest_Items">Quest_Items' petpage</a>.<br><br>

The Queen Faerie, Space Faerie, and Fountain Faerie Quests are very rare and can ask for <em>almost anything</em>. Their items are always between rarity 75 and 96.<br><br>However, <em>they will never ask for:</em><br><br><table><tr><td>
<ul class="cir2"><li>paint brushes</li>
<li>codestones</li>
<li>dubloons</li>
<li>job coupons</li>
<li>concert tickets</li></ul></td>
<td><ul class="cir2"><li>scratchcards</li>
<li>retired items</li>

<li>maps*</li>
<li>Nerkmids</li>
<li>Neopets</li></ul></td></tr></table>
They only ask for items that can be bought in the main Neopian Shops. Anyone claiming otherwise is not telling you the truth.<br><br><em>*Fountain Faerie Quest Item Note:</em> The Fountain Faerie can ask for a <em>Piece of a treasure map</em> since it is a r96 item. However, none of the other map pieces (Secret Laboratory, Petpet, Underwater, Space, or World Challenge) are within her rarity grouping. (Technically, she shouldn't be able to ask for this, either, since it can't be bought in Shops.)

<h5>What The Queen Wants, the Queen Gets!</h5>
The following lists show some of the items that these three Faeries have asked for in the past. These lists are primarily here to show you the <em>rarity of the items</em> that the Faeries ask for.<br><br>

<h4>Faeries FAQs</h4>
<div class="main">
This section is for any random Random Faerie quest notes (got that?;)<br><br><ul class="none"><li><b>Do I have to get the item for the Faerie?</b><br><br>
No, you don't. Don't blindly assume that you have to buy something because a Faerie told you to. If one of the regular faeries wants a new item or an avatar item, the price may too high to be worth it for your pets. If you can train your pets for cheaper, then turn down the Quest. (And if you don't train your pets at all, what's the point of paying for stats?)<br><br></li>
<li><b>Does anything bad happen if I do a random Dark faerie quest?</b><br><br>
No. Despite their negative publicity, the random Dark faeries are not evil. None of the other faeries will be mad at you if you finish a random Dark faerie's quest, and you won't affect your chances of getting other random quests.<br><br></li>
<li><b>How many faeries are there of each kind?</b><br><br>
The Queen, Space, and Fountain Faerie are each just one faerie. There are an unknown number of Fire, Earth, Water, Air, Dark, and Light faeries, however.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Do my chances of getting a quest go down if I turn down a Quest?</b><br><br>
No. Turning down a Quest <em>does not negatively affect your chances</em> of getting Quests again. When Queen Fyora finishes fuming and finally forgives you, she resets your Quests completely. The Faeries do not hold that rejected Quest against you -- they don't keep track at all! -- and they will gladly give you a Quest the next time you find them.<br><br></li>
<li><b>What happens after I turn down a Quest?</b><br><br>
The Faerie Queen will "ban" you from getting a quest for 600 seconds (10 minutes). After that time is up, you can go back to the Faerie Quests page to visit her and click the button under her. (And if you forget about going back, no worries -- the Quests will automatically reset eventually.)
<br><br></li>
<li><b>Which pet will the Faerie bless?</b><br><br>
It's random. Except for the Fountain Faerie, <em>each faerie chooses</em> which pet she wants to bless. I've found that they usually don't choose the active pet, but that's not always the case.<br><br>And if you think you've found a pattern to their blessing and try to manipulate that, they'll immediately break the pattern. People always try to write Al and tell her that they know the pattern. Funny, but their solutions are all different ;)<br><br>Only the Fountain Faerie is a sure thing; she always lets you paint the pet that's active when you visit the Fountain.<br><br></li>
<li><b>I haven't had a quest in <i>forever</i>! What's wrong</b><br><br>
Quests are random events. <em>You cannot increase your chances</em> of getting a quest specifically.<br><br>
You can, however, increase your chances of getting <em>any random event</em>. To do that, you need to reload pages around Neopia quite frequently. (Remember that using anything besides your own attached finger to refresh pages is against the Rules!) How to do that and still play around Neopia? If you play games such as <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/dicearoo.phtml">Dice-A-Roo</a> or <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/pyramids/index.phtml">Pyramids</a>, you'll be reloading those pages quite often.<br><br>Of course, you might find a not-so-nice random event, like a mewing Kadoatie that wants 5,000 NPs to shut up, eep! Erm, so, um, good luck!<br><br></li>

<li><b>Why can't I complete a Faerie Quest when I'm fighting in the Battledome?</b><br><br>
The Faeries' quests raise a pet's stats (or with the Earth Faerie, restores all lost HP), so finishing a quest in the middle of a battle might change the outcome of the fight. Finish the battle however you want to, and then go give the Faerie her item.<br><br></li>
<li><b>The Fountain Faerie</b><br><br><ul class="circle"><li>For more information on the Fountain Faerie and her Quest, see <a href="//www.neopets.com/~colored_buzz">colored_buzz's Fountain Faerie FAQ</a>.</li><br><li>The Fountain Faerie is <em>not the same</em> as a Water Faerie. There are multiple Water Faeries running, er, swimming around Neopia, but only one is the Fountain Faerie.<br><br>If you complete a Water Faerie's quest, she raises a pet's defense. If you complete the Fountain Faerie's quest, she lets you use the Rainbow Fountain in Faerieland to paint one pet almost any color.<br><table><tr><td><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/rainbowfountainfaerie.gif" height="150" width="150"></center></td><td><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/images/newuberwaterfaerie.gif" height="150" width="150"></center></td></tr><tr><td><center>The Fountain Faerie</center></td><td><center>A Water Faerie</center></td></tr></table><br></li>

 <li>The Fountain Faerie <em>does not allow</em> you to paint Royal, Robot, MSP, Ice, Sponge, or Usuki/Quiguki.<br><br></li>
 <li>She lets you paint your Active pet. You can change your pet around with Morphing or Transmogrification Potions first, switch pets, or even create a new one before going to visit her. If you make a mistake and take the wrong pet, don't panic! Just leave the Fountain and switch pets. (Al did that <i>twice</i>!)<br><br></li>
 <li>There is <em>no time limit</em> on Fountain Faerie quests, either for getting the item or after turning it in. Take as long as you need to earn your NPs and get your pet in order.<br><br></li>

 <li>The Fountain Faerie can ask for a "Piece of a treasure map". It's an r96 item, and though it can't be bought in Shops, she can ask for it. (One of Al's friends was asked for this; until that point, Al didn't believe it, either.)<br><br></li>
 <li>Multiple Fountain Quests - If you've turned in the first item but haven't painted your pet, and then you're lucky enough to get another FFQ, <em>finish the first Quest first</em> and paint your pet. Then turn in the second item. Otherwise, she will only let you paint one pet, and you would have lost one FFQ :(<br><br></li>
 <li><b>No pet:</b> If you do not have a pet but get a FFQ, <em>do not finish the Quest</em> until you have a pet. Otherwise, you do not get to use the Fountain, even if you get a pet after finishing the Quest.</li></ul></li>

<h4>Famous Faeries</h4>
<div class="main">
From time to time, I've seen people ask about the Faeries' names. So I made Al do some research, lots of knocking-on-doors turning-over-every-rock type stuff, and then I wrote up her results for you to see.<br><br><em>Note:</em> There are <a href="//www.neopets.com/faeries.phtml">more Faeries in Neopia</a> than this. These are just all the ones Al could find names for. Remember, there is more than one of each type of faerie, and the faerie who wants the item from you is probably none of these--these faeries are all too busy saving Neopia (or, with the Dark Faeries, trying to take it over). But this project was a way to entertain Al for a while...<br><br>
Names in <i>italics</i> are NeoQuest II characters. (Question marks are for those characters where Al couldn't decide if they were that type of faerie.)<br><br><table class="itty"><tr><td>Light Faeries:</td>

		<h2>Timed Quests</h2>
		<div class="main">
		Now, if you're tired of waiting on those Faeries to pop up on your screen, you can go to certain places in Neopia and accept a Quest from some of the inhabitants. If you do, they'll give you a list of ingredients and a time limit. You could also accept a Job from the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/employ/employment.phtml">Employment Agency</a> in Faerieland. <em>You can use the <a href="//www.neopets.com/market.phtml?type=wizard">Shop Wizard</a></em> to find the items on any Timed Quest or Job. See <a href="//www.neopets.com/~_CleopatrasCat_">Cleo's Timed Quests Guide</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/~_Prince_Tidus_">Prince Tidus' Jobs Guide</a> for more information.<br><br>

There are three timed quests in the Haunted Woods: <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/witchtower.phtml">Witch's Tower</a>, the big and brooding <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/braintree.phtml">Brain Tree</a>, and the always-misspelled <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/esophagor.phtml">Esophagor</a>.<br><br>In Faerieland, there's <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/darkfaerie.phtml">Jhudora's Cloud</a>, and, down in Meridell, <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/earthfaerie.phtml">Illusen's Glade</a>.<br><br>

On top of Terror Mountain, you can find the <a href="//www.neopets.com/winter/snowfaerie.phtml">Snow Faerie</a>.<br><br>Finally, hanging out on the beaches of Mystery Island, the harried Flotsam Chef runs the <a href="//www.neopets.com/island/kitchen.phtml">Kitchen Quests</a>.<br><br>

For all these timed quests, you can use the <a href="//www.neopets.com/market.phtml?type=wizard">Shop Wizard</a> to find the items. Unlike the Faerie quests, these quests do <i>not</i> block the Shop Wizard. It's a good thing, too, because what if no one was on the Quests Board to look up your items? You'd be stuck and would run out of time!

<h4>Timed Quests FAQs</h4><div class="main">
<ul class="none"><li><b>What if I fail? *quiver*</b></li>
There is <em>no penalty if you fail</em> a Timed Quest, either because you run out of time or because the items are too expensive. Absolutely nothing will happen to your pet--whoever you took the Quest from will not get mad at you, will not mutate your pet, will not take all your NeoPoints and items, will not decrease any of your pet's statistics, and will not do anything else horrific and far-fetched.<br><br>
(The exception is on Illusen's and Jhudora's Quests--if you fail, you will be sent back to Level 1, which, admittedly, can be pretty horrific if you were so close to getting a good prize.)<br><br>
But remember, <em>nothing will happen to your pets</em>. So take a deep breath and go fail that quest! Erm, well, what I meant was... er... <i>moving right along</i>...<br><br><li><b>Where did Edna go? I accepted her Quest, I got her items, but she's gone!</b></li>
Edna mysteriously vanishes from her tower for an hour at a time. If you visit her during this hour, you will get a message saying that no one seems to be at home. (Where is she? No one knows...) <em>But don't worry!</em> You don't lose that hour from your quest time. Go when she arrives back home, and she'll accept your item.<br><br><li><b>How do I answer the Brain Tree?</b></li>
</ul><ol><li>Accept the Brain Tree's quest.</li>
<li>Accept a quest from the <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/esophagor.phtml">Esophagor</a>.</li>
<li>Get the items for the Esophagor. He'll tell you the "when" answer. <em>Write it down!</em></li>
<li>Accept a quest from the <a href="//www.neopets.com/halloween/esophagor.phtml">Esophagor</a>. Yes, again.</li>
<li>Get the next items for the Esophagor. He'll tell you the "where" answer. <em>Write it down!</em></li>
<li>Go back to the Brain Tree. Type in the answers the Esophagor gave you, with the right capitalization and spelling.</li>
</ol><br>
You must feed the Esophagor, else no matter what you enter to the Brain Tree will be considered wrong. The Esophagor will also give you a quest of his own, and for that, I would advise spending no more than 2,000 NPs. However, when you're on the Brain Tree's quest as well, I advise that you <em>spend only 2,000 NPs total</em>, on both Quests combined. The Brain Tree tends to be a bit stingy with his prizes.<br><br><em>Capitalization and Spelling are important!</em> If the answer is "The Haunted Woods", you must include the "The" and you must capitalize every word exactly as the Esophagor told you. You can open the Esophagor's quest in separate browser tabs so that you have access to both answers when you go to the Brain Tree.<br><br>
See the <a href="//www.neopets.com/~zzdodozz">Brain Tree Walk-Through</a> for more information.<br><br><em>About the Esophagor:</em> If you aren't on a Brain Tree quest and you visit the Esophagor, he will still give you a Quest! He wants expensive food even if the Brain Tree isn't looking for answers, thought. Greedy pig...<br></div>

<a name="BTlist"></a>
<h4>The Brain Tree Project</h4>
<div class="main">
We're trying to create a list of the Dates and Places that are used in the Brain Tree quest. If you did both Esophagor quests but forgot one of the answers, use these lists to help you figure it out:<br><br><table class="itty"><tr><td colspan="2" width="50%"><b>Dates</b></td>
<td colspan="2"><b>Places</b></td>

</tr></table><br>
Remember, entering random answers <em>will not work</em>. You still have to feed the Esophagor two times. Feeding him is an actual step in finishing the Quest.<br><br>
These lists are <em>only</em> for people who have forgotten one of the answers that the Esophagor gave them.<br><br></div></td></tr><tr><td class="tdgutter"><a name="TQRew"></a></td><td class="tdleft">

<h4>Timed Quests Rewards</h4><div class="main">
The Timed Quests don't have specific rewards like the Faerie Quests do, but they do have some general lines that they follow:<br><table class="itty"><tr><td width="100">Quest</td><td width="100">Spend</td><td>Get</td></tr><tr><td>Edna</td><td>500 NPs</td><td>~100 NPs and a spooky food item (usually cheap)</td></tr><tr><td>Brain Tree</td><td>2,000 NPs</td><td>~1,000 NPs and an item (usually ~1,000 NPs)</td></tr><tr><td>Esophagor</td><td>2,000 NPs</td><td>Item (~1-2,000 NPs)</td></tr><tr><td>Snow Faerie</td><td>3,000 NPs</td><td>~1,500 NPs, snowball, and an item (usually ~1-3,000 NPs)</td></tr><tr><td>Kitchen</td><td>2,000 NPs</td><td>NPs (~1-2,000 NPs) <i>OR</i> item (~1-3,000 NPs) <i>OR</i> stat boost</td></tr></table><br>
Now, yes, everyone has stories of how the Snow Faerie or Brain Tree gave them a 50<i>k</i>-NP-worth item. But those stories are few and far between. Most often, you hear people screaming about how the Esophagor ripped them off.<br><br>
So, while the preceeding list isn't all-authoritative, it does present some general guidelines for doing those timed quests. If you stay within these guidelines, you'll most likely come out ahead when doing timed Quests.

<h4>Illusen &amp; Jhudora</h4><div class="main">
Illusen's and Jhudora's Quests are special--you spend huge amounts of NPs for them in hopes of getting a good prize at a higher level. Usually, you won't make it, because they eventually ask for unbuyable items and only give you 16 minutes to find them! You might have the NPs to pay for the item, but the hard part is to find someone online who's willing to trade immediately.<br><br>
If you're going to go for these two Quests at higher levels, try to do it at peak Neopets times, times when the most people are playing in Neopia; that's usually about 9 a.m. - 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. - 8 p.m., NST, in my experience. You'll have a better chance of finding someone on the <a href="http://neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=11">Shop Ads</a>, <a href="http://neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=6">Trades/Auctions</a>,
or even <a href="http://neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=10">Battledome</a> Boards with the item you need. (Sorry, the Quests Board mostly does lookups; we don't actually have rare items.)<br><br>
These two are worth doing for a little while, at least--the prize for Level 20 includes an avatar. The other prizes, before Level 35, are worth hardly anything because most everyone can make it through those levels.<br><br><table class="itty"><tr><td>Level</td><td align="left">Illusen</td>

By the way, you <em>can</em> alternate between the two of them: that is, you can one Illusen quest and then one Jhudora quest. You don't have to do just Illusen quests or just Jhudora quests. <em>And</em>, nothing bad happens to you if you do Jhudora quests. Just because she's an evil faerie plotting the downfall of Neopia doesn't make you an evil person for doing her quest.<br><br></div>

<h4>Illusen &amp; Jhudora FAQs</h4>
<div class="main">
<ul class="none"><li><b>Illusen/Jhudora wants an item that doesn't exist!</b><br>If they want Wall Paint or Floor Tiles, those are items that cannot be bought or sold by users. So you'll have to buy them directly from the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neohome/shop">Neohomes NP Superstore</a>. If the item you need doesn't show up immediately, either refresh the page or click the "more" button on the right.<br><br></li>

<li><b>I finished a Quest for Illusen/Jhudora and she didn't give me a prize!</b><br>
Yes, that's normal. They don't give prizes on every level. See the previous section for a list of the levels that give you prizes.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Why won't Illusen/Jhudora let me do a quest? She says I'm on a quest for the other one or she's not ready to give me a quest!</b><br>
Illusen and Jhudora hate it if you do a quest for the other one, and neither likes to give too many quests per day. You have to wait <em>12 hours between Quests</em>.<br><br>That means 12 hours between two Illusen Quests, or 12 hours between two Jhudora Quests, or 12 hours between a quest for Illusen and a quest for Jhudora. You <b>can</b> be doing quests for the two of them one after the other, but you have to wait 12 hours between times.<br><br></li>

<b>Getting the "I'm not ready to give you a quest" message?</b><br>
If either Illusen or Jhudora is pouting and saying that she won't give you a quest, that means you must have failed the last one. Technically, though, until she gives you that message, you're still on her Quest! So the other faerie will tell you she won't give you a quest, either. Once you get that message, you're back to waiting for 12 hours for the next quest. Sheesh.<br><br><li><b>Once I start, do I have to do Illusen/Jhudora's Quest every day?</b></li>
No. You can take as much time between quests as you like.<br><br><li><b>Is it bad to help Jhudora?</b></li>
No. Doing Jhudora's quest doesn't affect the rest of your Quests (timed or random), and it doesn't affect your pets/accounts/anything else.<br><br><li><b>How do I get the Illusen/Jhudora trophy?</b></li>
Be in the top 17 of the High Score list (<a href="//www.neopets.com/gamescores.phtml?game_id=160">Illusen</a>, <a href="//www.neopets.com/gamescores.phtml?game_id=126">Jhudora</a>) <i>at the end of the month</i>. Points are awarded based on how quickly you finish the Quests. The High Score list is reset on the 1<sup>st</sup> of each month, so if you want to get on it, pick a Faerie and start her Quest on the 1<sup>st</sup>, trying to finish a Quest every 12 hours for the whole month.<br><br><li><b>When do they start asking for Unbuyables (UBs)?</b></li>
It varies. It's really the <em>item rarity</em> that is increasing as you get higher. Often rarer items cost more, but not always. Usually, however, you'll encounter UBs before or on Level 35. (Some people report encountering them at Level 25! That's usually for more recently-released items, though.)<br><br>Be sure to post on the <a href="http://neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=11">Shop Ads</a>, <a href="http://neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=6">Trades/Auctions</a>,
or <a href="http://neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=10">Battledome</a> boards to try to find someone with an UB! You will also want to try to do the Quests at high-traffic times in Neopia so that there are more people available on the message boards to help you out.<br><br><li><b>How many NPs should I have in order to finish Illusen's/Jhudora's Quests?</b></li>
Well, Al started playing in April 2003, and she hasn't heard of anyone finishing all 50 Levels for either Illusen or Jhudora since that date, so she has no point of reference. It may still be possible, but you're gonna need a lot of luck.... The real catch to finishing doesn't seem to be a lack of NPs but rather a lack of items and/or sellers. You only get 16 minutes! And finding someone ready to sell those UBs can be really hard to do.<br><br>
For Levels 1-10, you probably need about 25-50k per level.<br>
For Levels 10-20, you probably need about 50-100k per level.<br>
For Levels 21-30, you probably need about 100-200k per level.<br>
For Levels 30-35, you probably need about 200k-1M per level.<br>
For Levels 35+, ... 1M - 10M? Now we're in uncharted territory...<br><br><li><b>Jhudora Day and Illusen Day</b></li>
Jhudora Day is February 4<sup>th</sup>. Illusen Day is March 17<sup>th</sup>. On Jhudora Day and Illusen Day, the other faerie's quest will be unavailable. (That is, on Jhudora Day, you can't do Illusen's quest; on Illusen Day, you can't do Jhudora's quest.)<br><br>
Jhudora kidnaps Illusen and leaves a cardboard cutout in her place on Jhudora Day. (You would think Illusen would get wise to this after a while or that there would be a faerie smackdown every Feb 5<sup>th</sup>...) Jhudora goes off to pout on Illusen Day. (Why is everything about Jhudora?)<br><br>

On Jhudora Day and Illusen Day, do a quest for the day's faerie and you'll get her "day" avatar:<br><center><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/illusendoll.gif"><img src="//images.neopets.com/neoboards/avatars/jhudoraohyeah.gif"><br></center>The next day, everything will be back to normal in Neopia and you can go back to either faerie for a quest.<br><br><em>Important:</em> Know when the days are coming up and be sure that you'll have the necessary Quest available! That is, check with both faeries the day before and make sure you've cleared all messages and that they're both back to asking if you'll do a quest for her. (Don't say "yes"; just go check.)<br><br>

<h4>Jobs</h4><div class="main">
You can get a Basic Job from the <a href="//www.neopets.com/faerieland/employ/employment.phtml">Employment Agency</a> in Faerieland. The jobs are hard to get, because everyone is watching for them. They "restock" at the top of the hour, and then again every 10 minutes after that. (That is, :00:00 and :10:00, :20:00, etc.)<br><br>

If you do get a Job, you can use the Shop Wizard; just be sure to search for the items singularly, not as written. (For example, if it asks for "Three Sun Hats," search for "Sun Hat" and buy 3 of them.)<br><br>
The faster you turn the items back in, the better your reward!</div> 
<h2>Super Jobs</h2>
<div class="main">
Don't even bother with the Super Jobs, for which you need a Brightvale Job Coupon. You can win Brightvale Job Coupons from the <a href="//www.neopets.com/medieval/knowledge.phtml">Wheel of Knowledge</a>. But you probably won't get paid a lot and are better off selling the Coupons. Check the Wiz first, if you want--the price of the coupon against the price of the base reward.<br><br>
(The original Job Coupons were originally a promotion Neopets offered for signing up with a sponsor; the promotion is no longer going on, so there is no way to get Job Coupons now except from other people.)

<h4>How to Get Help</h4>
<div class="main">
<blockquote><br><center><b>How to get help on the Quests Board:<br><br>
1. Post a new topic.<br><br>
2. Be patient.</b><br><br></center></blockquote><br>
Seriously, that's it.<br><br><em>1. Post a <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/create_topic.phtml?board=9">new topic</a></em> with a title that relates to your quest. "Attention- grabbing" posts (<i>OMG!</i>, <i>Click here</i>, or lots of animated smilies, for example) actually do not get our attention. Even boards called "Reward" will not usually get you helped any faster.<br><br>Generally, Helpers are moving methodically up the Board, starting with the lowest post with "0" replies. The only reason we might click on your post earlier is because we suspect your post is not Quest-related or is a scam, and we're planning to tell you to go somewhere else or to read the Rules. (And often, if Al clicks a suspicious post earlier but it's a legitimate Quest post, she leaves and goes back for the next "0" post.)<br><br>
An alternative to starting your own post is to look for a thread that offers Quest Help. <em>Before you post there</em>, make certain of a few things:<br><br><ol><li>Is the Helper still there? Look for their last post and look at <em>the time stamp!</em>. Also look to see if they posted "Board Closed" or somesuch.</li>
<li>Has anyone posted that this person is scamming? If so, go elsewhere for help!</li></ol><br><em>Do not</em> post on someone else's "New Topic". Your post will be unnoticed. We do not keep track of every single post on every single thread.<br><br><em>2. Now, be patient!</em> Helpers usually look up an item first and post the results second. If you *bump* your own post because you're impatient, we'll think another Helper has beaten us to your post, and we'll skip right over you! Also, with the 30-second lag between posts, it takes us longer to reply.<br><br>
We look for topics with "0" replies first. We're usually very consistently busy on the Quests board, and it's not our fault if you answer yourself first.<br><br>
In general, do not NeoMail the Helpers for help or ask on your board that we NeoMail you. Very few of us will actually respond that way. Posting on the Boards is much faster and easier for us.<br><br><em>Other general tips for getting help quickly:</em><br><br><ul class="circle"><li>Be sure you've spelled your item correctly. We don't have them all memorized.<br><br></li>
<li>Take off any apostrophes (') accompanying the item name (that will cut down on how long a lookup takes).<br><br></li>
<li>Don't explain or tell a story. We know you're on a Quest. We know you'd like help. Post the item name and maybe "please and thank you". We don't need to know anything else, and reading it only slows us down.<br><br></li>
<li>If you are on a Timed Quest but are Wiz-banned, <em>tell us that</em> in your first post. We're likely to help you if we know you're banned. If you don't tell us, we'll assume you either don't know about the Shop Wizard on Timed Quests (so we'll usually tell you that first) or are trying to get us to price your Shop for you.<br><br></li>
<li>If you aren't getting help, and you've followed all of our advice so far, <em>do not</em> create topics accusing everyone of ignoring you. <em>Do not</em> get mad at people and start causing a scene to get attention. You will only get yourself mocked and not helped.<br><br>
Start a new topic, sure, but stay calm and polite. Even better, don't mention that you got skipped earlier; just post and wait.</li>
</ul><br></div>

<h4>Super Shop Wizard Notes</h4>
<div class="main">
Yes, many Quests Helpers are <a href="//www.neopets.com/~Leto">Premium users</a> and do have the Super Shop Wizard, and we do often use it when we help on the Quests Board. <b>However</b>, posting a Topic requesting that only Premium members answer your post will get you ignored by those very users. Or, we may answer your post, but we will use the regular Shop Wizard.<br><br>
We pay actual money in order to use that service, and it has a very limited number of searches, compared to the regular Wiz. Premium users are not at your beck and call, and we are not required to use the SSW for you. We are, however, more than willing to give you a Premium invitation and let you pay for it yourself...<br><br>
The Super Shop Wizard works by returning the lowest Shops of all the regular Wizard divisions. It does not return "extra" Shops or "different" Shops than the regular Wizard. It returns the same results, but in a different order. That's all.<br><br>
If you have a timed Quest, refresh the regular Wizard. You do get the same results. No, it isn't as fast, but if you want the SSW to make your Timed Quests go faster, then you can pay for it yourself.<br><br>
Also the SSW cannot look up every item; it refuses to look up Secret Laboratory Map pieces, paint brushes (not even plushies!), and Nerkmids, to name a few.
<br><br></div>
<h4>Other things often mistaken for Quests</h4>
<div class="main">
If you're on a "quest" from your Guild, sorry, but we won't help with those. We only help with Quests that need the Shop Wizard. Try the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=1">Fan Club</a> or <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=13">Beauty Contest</a> Boards to find certain pets.<br><br>
Looking for a challenger for the <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/defenders.phtml">Defenders of Neopia</a> game? Notice the word "game"--ask the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=23">Games</a> or <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=10">Battledome</a> Boards. Once again, we use the Shop Wiz only.<br><br>
Looking for food for the <a href="//www.neopets.com/games/kadoatery/index.phtml">Kadoatery</a>? Most of that food is unbuyable; try asking the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=6">Trades/ Auctions</a> Board. Need help with the Kadoatery? Ask on the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=23">Games</a> board.<br><br>
Need NeoQuest I or NeoQuest II help? Despite the "Quest" in the names, they're actually both Games. Try the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=16">NeoQuest</a> board. You can also try the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=23">Games</a> board if the board is unresponsive.<br><br>
Need Key Quest help? Despite the "Quest" in its name, it's actually a Game. Again, try the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=35">Key Quest</a> board or the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=23">Games</a> board. <br><br>
Need any other kind of help and can't figure out where to go? Check out the <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=5">Help Board</a> (imagine that).<br><br></div>
<h4>One Final Note</h4><div class="main">
Don't make the mistake of thinking that the Helpers are stupid. We are not all 12-year-olds that you can bully or confuse with big words. Most of us know more big words than you.<br><br>
We have a good idea of which items are for Quests and which are not. If you consistently show up needing questionable items looked up, we <em>will</em> realize that you're just trying to take advantage of us, and we <em>will</em> do something about it.

<h4>Finding An Item</h4>
<div class="main">When a Helper gives you results from the Shop Wizard, it will probably look something like the following:<br><blockquote>Shop Owner	Item	Amount in Stock	Price<br>
user1 Item Name	2	975 NP<br>
user2 Item Name	18	1,000 NP<br>
user3 Item Name	1	1,000 NP</blockquote><br>
This means that user1's Shop has 2 of the item for 975 NPs; user2's Shop has 18 for 1,000 NPs; and so on. (Note: when someone uses the Super Shop Wizard, the item name may be missing, but everything else is the same).<br><br>
Now that you have a Shop Owner's name, type the name into the "Search Neopets" box in the left sidebar and click "Go." This takes you to a User Look-up. Find and click on the Shop link. In the shop, click on the Item that you wish to buy.<br><br></div>
<h4>Give It To The Faerie</h4><div class="main">
Now that you have the item, go to "Pet Central" on the top bar, then 'Quests' from the bottom right. (You could also try to use the <a href="//www.neopets.com/market.phtml?type=wizard">Shop Wizard</a> and get yelled at, or just zip straight to the <a href="//www.neopets.com/quests.phtml">Faerie Quests</a> page.) There will be a button there for you to turn in the item.<br><br>
There is also a button there if you should decide to cancel the Quest, which you <i>will</i> occasionally need to do. If most of the Helpers on the Quests Board tell you to cancel it, we're probably right. Remember, turning down a Quest does <em>not</em> affect your chances of getting more Quests.

<h4>Helpers</h4>

<div class="main">
*dramatic music* They aid the frantic Quester, they defend the Quest Board, they oust the greedy scammer. They are the Quest Helpers! *crescendo*<br><br>
So maybe that was a bit over the top, but really, the Quest Board guardians are <i>the</i> people you want on your side when you have a quest. Though the faces themselves fluctuate, the character of a real Helper remains constant.<br><br>
The real, blue-blooded Quest Helpers are the ones who cheerfully look up your item on their Shop Wizard (refreshing for the lowest price, of course) and post the results, then move on to the next topic. They refuse to let scammers and spammers have even a foothold on the Quests Board.<br><br>
You don't need to "sign up" anywhere to be a Quests Helper. You don't have to join any Guild; you don't even have to be on Neopets consistently. <em>Just show up</em> with your Shop Wizard in tow. There are almost always more people with Quests than there are people to help, so more Helpers are always welcome!<br><br>
To be a <i>good</i> Quests Helper, there are a few things you'll want to keep in mind:<br><ul class="circle"><li><em>Find the lowest price.</em> Refresh the Shop Wizard a couple of times (or use the Super Wiz!).</li><br><li><em>Know the Rules.</em> Familiarize yourself with the <a href="//www.neopets.com/chatrules.phtml">neoRules</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/terms.phtml">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>. Don't break the Rules yourself!</li><br><li><em>Keep your cool.</em> People <i>will</i> be rude and they <i>will</i> forget to say "please" and "thank you." Just let that roll off of you. If it ever stops being fun, take a break for a while.</li><br><li><em>Understand the Quests.</em> This page and others can help you learn all about the Quests. It's usually a good idea to know what's going on if anyone starts asking questions!</li>
</ul><br></div>
<h4>Advantages of Being a Helper</h4>
<div class="main">
What are the advantages of being a regular Quests Helper? For one thing, you're helping people out; you're being noble and civic-minded, helping out your fellow Neopians.<br><br>For another, you're keeping busy and refreshing pages, which is always good for random events (and Faerie quests of your own!). And since you're looking up a lot of items on the Shop Wizard, you can usually find some nice snipes ;)<br><br>
You'll also find, as you hang around the Board, that you'll start to recognize the other Helpers, and they'll start to recognize you, too. This is a good thing, since when <i>you</i> have a quest of your own, the Helpers will be quite willing to help you out, knowing that you are one of their own. You will also find, should you have to confront a spammer or scammer on the Board, that the other Helpers will join with you and defend you.<br><br>So, you get to be kind and helpful and pass on the help you've been given, and you get to meet and be a part of a community of like-minded people. What more could you ask for?<br><br></div>
<h4>How To Help</h4>
<div class="main">
Al and I have seen many different approaches to Quests Helping (and helping in general). We have seen situations quickly degenerate into name-calling, smart-aleck comments, and all-around rudeness from both sides.<br><br>
After discussions with some of our friends, who are also appalled by this trend, Al and I have decided to describe a technique for dealing with obnoxious, scamming, offensive, or ignorant people. One of our friends calls this approach "gentle force".<br><br>
The first part of the "gentle force" concept is to always always <em>always maintain your cool and calm image</em> on the Boards. No matter how insulting, disgusting, or annoying the other person is, you must be the serene center. <br><br>The second part of the "gentle force" concept is to turn the person's attention toward <em>something that can help them</em>--give them the <a href="//www.neopets.com/freebies" alt="Monthly Freebies">Freebies</a> link for quick NPs; point them to a better <a href="//www.neopets.com/neoboards/index.phtml" alt="The Boards">Board</a> or to a helpful petpage; or tell them a place on the site that has what they really need. This help should be delivered without any malice or snarky comments. (To help herself do this, Al created <a href="/~Xidantzu">an "answers" petpage</a> with ready-made posts. She made that page when she was nice and mellow, so there wouldn't be any hidden animosity behind the posts.)<br><br>You will be surprised at how many times simply posting the link to the Healing Springs will draw a meek "Thank you" from the previously hyperventilating user...<br><br>Finally, the "gentle force" concept comes back around to the first part again -- maintaining your self-control <em>no matter how the other person responds</em>. They may react negatively because some people actually don't want helpful advice. If their behavior warrants it, alert the monitors to the situation. But above all, stay self-controlled and act maturely.<br><br>The main goal of "gentle force" is to <em>educate the user, even over their protests</em>. If you keep your answers neutral and polite, you'll outlast and outwit even the most stubborn users. Zippy one-liners may make your friends laugh or may win you a moment or two of fame, but it doesn't help the person who needs it (especially when they don't know that they need help!).<br><br><em>As a Helper, you should be trying to increase the Neopian-IQ of everyone around you.</em>

<h4>Scams</h4>

<div class="main">
Not everyone who hangs out on the Quests Board is a Helper. Some people hang around because they're waiting to scam harried users who are on Quests.<br><br></div>
<h4>How do I distinguish Real Helpers from scammers?</h4>
<div class="main">
<em>1.</em> Real Helpers will <em>never ask for a reward</em> and will <em>not charge you for a Shop Wizard lookup</em>. This includes saying "Rewards appreciated". This also includes any references to voting for the user's pet in the Beauty Contest in exchange for help. That. Is. Cheating.<br><br>
Firstly, it's illegal to require Neopoints or items in exchange for any services, which would include using the Shop Wizard for someone. From the Support pages: <i>Performing services for other users for Neopoints, Items, money or anything else is forbidden by our Terms and Conditions</i>.<br><br>
Secondly, being a Helper is not a way to make a living on Neopets; go play games or tend a shop! Besides, if everyone else on the Board is advertising "Free Help", the only response to these topics will be the real Helpers, telling the scammers that they can't do that.<br><br><em>2.</em> Real Helpers <em>don't put an item in their own shop or trades</em>. Most people who "help" in that way are trying to make a profit--when they put it into their Shop or Trades, they overcharge the Quester. Often it's not by much, but that little bit starts to add up very quickly.<br><br>

Again, they're making a profit off the Quester's helplessness, and making a profit off what should be a free service. I don't like it at all when someone does this; I think it's mean and very rude to the Questers. So don't do it!<br><br>Besides, often the Quester is posting on more than one board (because they're impatient); if they find it cheaper, then the scammer is stuck with that item. It's much simpler for everyone involved to just list the cheapest Shop Wizard prices.<br><blockquote><b>WARNING to all Questers!!!</b><br><i>Some people will claim to have your item in their Shop or will say they'll put it in their Shop or Trades. BE AWARE that many of these people are overcharging you--you MAY be able to get the item much cheaper!</i></blockquote><br>
Notice that this little message, which Helpers often post on shop scammers' threads, does NOT accuse the scammer of overcharging. It only points out that -some- people are overcharging and encourages the questees to get a second opinion.<br><br>
One more note on scammers like this: Real Helpers often start posting on the scammer's thread with actual cheap Shop Wizard prices. Scammers claim this is harassment. According to The Neopets Team, however, it's NOT harassment to post prices. If you're a Real Helper in this situation, avoid an argument with the scammer and continue helping the questees.<br><br><em>3.</em> Finally, Real Helpers <em>never advertise their own shop</em> on the Quests Board. Advertising a Shop is not Quests Help.<br><br>

The Faeries ask for a specific item on each Quest. Just because a shop claims to have Quests items does not mean that it will have what a Quester is looking for. And since the goal of the Quests Board is to unite Questers with their item, posting a Shop that may or may not have the item cannot be considered help.<br><br>
Besides, there is a Shop Ads Board! So any Shop Ad posted in the Quests Board is actually <a href="//www.neopets.com/~slinginator#evilspam">spam</a>! Now, you <i>may</i> post your Shop in response to someone's post for help, if you have the item, but you <a href="//www.neopets.com/~zzdodozz">cannot make a new topic</a> on the Quests Board just to promote your Shop.</div>

<h4>Bad Behavior</h4>

<div class="main">
It's not just some fake "helpers" who behave badly on the Quests board. Often some people who are actually on Quests or just passing by try some questionable behavior.
		</div>
<h4><a name="Beg"></a>Begging</h4>
<div class="main">
<em>Do not beg for items on the Quests Board.</em> We will only tell you to play more games and otherwise earn the NPs yourself, and, if you persist, we will report you. We have little tolerance for beggars.<br><br>
You're asking someone else to do the work for you, and people will resent that. Every pixel that someone owns on this site is the result of a lot of work. Think about that before you beg again.<br><br>
Most Helpers have just as many NPs as you do, maybe less, but we enjoy helping our fellow Neopians to find items that they need.<br><br>There's another point to consider about begging, too. It's <em>against the <a href="//www.neopets.com/chatrules.phtml">Rules</a> and <a href="//www.neopets.com/terms.phtml">Terms &amp; Conditions</a></em> as "scamming to get items/NPs".<br><br>

How, you ask? Quite simple, really. Scamming is tricking people out of something that you haven't earned, of something that belongs to them through their own hard work. Beggars try to say that they don't have the time/ energy/ computer/ programs/ skills/ ability to play Neopets for themselves and earn their own items or NPs. But guess what <a href="/~Atablicryon">so many petpages</a> in Neopia are about? That's right, all the easy ways to earn NPs!<br><br>So <em>begging is really scamming</em> because everyone on Neopets starts from the same place and has exactly the same opportunities as everyone else. How you take advantage of those opportunities is up to you.<br><br>
In <a href="//www.neopets.com/ntimes/index.phtml?section=editorial%3D278">a recent Editorial</a>, The Neopets Team used the phrase "Begging like that is not allowed." (And if you read the question, it asked about "Asking for donations". So their reply could be read as "Begging by asking for donations is not allowed.") They have said it could be reported as spamming. Spam is any useless, worthless, or pointless post.<br><br></div>
		
<a name="Contests"></a>
<h4>Contests and Chain Letters</h4>
<div class="main">
Contests are not allowed on Neopets by anyone other than Neopets themselves. Read the <a href="//www.neopets.com/terms.phtml">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> that you agreed to abide by when you signed up with Neopets: <i>3. ...you understand and agree that you will not post or send through the site any words, images or links containing or relating to: promotions offering prizes of any sort (including contests, raffles, lotteries, chain letters or any kind of giveaway).</i> 
		<br><br>And later, in the "fine print": <i>You hereby understand and agree that Neopets does not allow Postings that contain: Promotions anywhere on Neopets' site offering prizes of any kind. Promotions include, but are not limited to, contests, raffles, lotteries or giveaways, and "anywhere on our site" includes but is not limited to all of Neopets' user communication areas, onsite pet's webpage, shop front or onsite guild webpage.</i><br><br>

Might just be my interpretation, but that seems to cover just about every kind of contest you could imagine. There's another little note in one of those--chain letters. Anything that says "Post this message on 10 boards/trades. Then visit somewhere in Neopia or play this game and you will get 1,000,000 neopoints and one of all the paintbrushes. It's a Neopet's code." is a chain message. From the NeoRules: <i>13. Do not spam the message boards, guild boards, or other site areas. This includes Chain Letters of any kind!</i> <br><br>
And before you complain, "But, Marchegai, holding contests and posting chain letters doesn't hurt you. Why should you care if I post them?", here's a note from the end of the Terms and Conditions: <i><b>BEWARE:</b> If you do <b>any of the above</b> we may <b>freeze your account permanently.</b></i><br><br>
You should be glad I care--I'm helping you to <i>not</i> get frozen. And I'm also trying to help other players, who may not know any better, from having a similar fate.</div>

We look first for posts with "0" replies; if a board has a reply, we assume you've been helped and will skip the post.</li><br><li>We will tell you the SHOP where you can find your item. Expect nothing more, though you may be surprised. Not all the helpers are as rich as you think, though we can still be generous.</li><br><li>Do not expect us to NeoMail you with what we find; this takes too of much of our time, and we have a lot of other people to help.</li><br><li>Any quest with a TIME LIMIT allows you to use the Shop Wizard. You don't need our help for that.</li><br><li>Brain Tree answers can only be obtained by feeding the Esophagor in the Haunted Woods twice. No one else can help you, even if they wanted to.</li><br><li>NO FAERIE QUEST will ask for a Paint Brush, Job Coupon, Codestone, Dubloon, Ticket, Scratchcard, or Neopet, so don't try scamming us. We will report you.</li><br><li>Faeries rarely ask for Kadoatery items. We know what the Kads want, and we know what the Faeries want. Kadoatery items are often over 100,000 NPs anyway, so look on the Trades/Auctions. Don't try scamming us.</li><br><li>If you can't afford your item, play some games, especially on quests without time limits. Begging for items will only prove that you are immature. If you cannot afford a timed quest, then don't finish it; there's no penalty.</li><br><li>Post in legible and readable font--this means no invisible or crazy text, no chat speak, and no all caps. If we can't read your item, we can't find it. And if you have insulting neoHTML or neoHTML that isn't easily distinguisable from your request, you also may not get help.</li><br><li>Post exact item and spelling. Better yet, copy and paste the entire faerie quest message (without apostrophes). Helpers do not have time to correct spelling and play guessing games to find your items, and we do NOT know all the items.</li><br><li>Please and Thank you are much appreciated. Quest helpers should never ask for rewards. We help because we love the game.</li><br><li>Respect the helpers. Chances are pretty good if you upset one of us, you will find yourself going through 20 million shops for your item. We all know each other, and we stick together.</li><br><li>Scam or spam anywhere on the board, and you will be reported. This includes chain letters, fake quests, contests, and shop ads. Read the Terms &amp; Conditions if you're unsure about anything.</li>

Over our time on the Quests Board, Al and I have embarked on a number of ambitious projects. One of these involved tracking how many of each quest was reported. We really wanted to know the chances that the next Faerie Quest we encountered would be the Fountain Faerie's.<br><br>
For this project, we simply counted how many of each particular faerie quest showed up on the Quests Board, and then calculated what percentage of the total number of faerie quests that represented. Here's what we found:<br><br><table class="itty"><tr><td>
<b>Faerie</b></td>
<td><b># of Quests</b></td>
<td><b>% of Total</b></td></tr><td>Earth</td><td>172</td><td>11%</td>
<td>Fire</td><td>244</td><td>15%</td>
<td>Air</td><td>259</td><td>16%</td>

<td>Water</td><td>320</td><td>20%</td>
<td>Light</td><td>278</td><td>17%</td>
<td>Dark</td><td>280</td><td>17%</td>
<td>Faerie Queen</td><td>46</td><td>0%</td>
<td>Space Faerie</td><td>12</td><td>0%</td>

<td>Fountain Faerie</td><td>19</td><td>0%</td>
<td></td><td><sub>Total Quests compiled: 1630</sub></td>

</table><br>
We assume that the six types of normal faeries--Earth, Fire, Air, Water, Light, and Dark--actually give Quests at the same rate but that many of these (especially Earth) are not reported. And, of course, a lot of people get Quests Help on another Board, which will also skew the results. The important numbers, of course, are for the remaining three. Again, with the Space Faerie, we assume we haven't seen her quests reported a lot. (Maybe no one knows what she does so they turn her down?) But because of the <a href="#IFaeries">rarity</a> of their items, we predict that the Faerie Queen actually gives the most Quests, followed by the Space Faerie and, finally, the Fountain Faerie.
